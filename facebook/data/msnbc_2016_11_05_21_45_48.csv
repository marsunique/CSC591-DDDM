1 | Joe Smooth | 403 | 1558992360787455_1558995084120516 | Trump I thought u were about that life? Talking tough all this time but being rush away from danger. All u got is ur mouth buddy! vote Hillary
2 | Ganesh K. Nathan | 281 | 1558992360787455_1558994354120589 | This is what happens when Trump & GOP turned a peaceful & civil election process into a violent & confrontational one.They are just getting a taste of their own medicine but they will never learn
3 | Jane Ann Baker | 150 | 1558992360787455_1558999564120068 | It was clearly a staged event and he came back on  stage without a ruffle in his feathers. He would have had to change his pants if it had been anything but planned.
4 | Raja Wahid | 63 | 1558992360787455_1558995007453857 | That's the great way to get more media coverage than Hillary Clinton with only three days left in the campaign/election. But he shouldn't get that much coverage on the basis of his today's stunt but he may get RealDonald JTrump
5 | Matt Leeds | 54 | 1558992360787455_1559003320786359 | This is one scared little pathetic baby... He just showed the entire country what his true colors are when he's faced with danger. It shows that he's nothing but a coward... He truly is a #Whineylittlebitch #BlueFalcon
6 | Benjamin James | 39 | 1558992360787455_1559000620786629 | This is only to to get attention. One of Donald J. Trump's media set up. Another way for Donald J. Trump to work the gullible media, just the same way they jumped all over the FBI stunt. Another stunt. Political stunt!!
7 | Kim Hashimoto | 56 | 1558992360787455_1558995977453760 | Hope he doesn't come back on stage EVER again !!! GOOD RIDDANCE Racist !!!
8 | Susan Jardine | 16 | 1558992360787455_1559002140786477 | So I just watched MSNBC to see how they're covering this story. Of course you're blaming the violence on Trump supporters. Need I remind you of the Project Veritas videos we've all seen? Scott Foval? Bob Creamer? Zulema Rodriguez who all admitted to either hiring people or they themselves inciting violence at Trump rallies? Most of us who are wise enough to pay attention know the truth.
9 | Pam Renee | 122 | 1558992360787455_1558993044120720 | He ran like a scared little biotch... bwhahahahah
10 | Debbie Fromer | 8 | 1558992360787455_1559008357452522 | So this stupid thing happens, and right away I have to look at another picture of this creep in my newsfeed. Enough already with this sleazebag.
11 | Franklin Larnza | 11 | 1558992360787455_1558998117453546 | I will sum this up in a few words. If Hillary by some miracle gets elected, how about all you Hillary followers go to the families of the men that Hillary left to die in Benghazi....look them in the eyes and tell them that you voted for the woman that left their loved ones to die after they repeatedly called for help.
12 | Thomas Williams | 6 | 1558992360787455_1559005894119435 | Do you liberals ever take responsibility? This was a set up? Yet if it had been Clinton then you still would have blamed Trump! The one thing the left and right have in common is we don't trust the other.
13 | Brendi Archuleta | 6 | 1558992360787455_1559007377452620 | I love how he just stands there like an idiot and tries to see what's going on. Just another example of how he doesn't know what he's doing.
14 | Jacquelyn M Collier | 6 | 1558992360787455_1559008814119143 | I looked staged, hus face was blank and he watched I t play out for way too long before they rushed him off the stage.But I'm sure they will find a way to blame Hillary Clinton. ...my life depends on my vote.IM WITH HER HILLARY HILLARY HILLARY HILLARY HILLARY HILLARY HILLARY HILLARY 100%
15 | Annmarie Richardson | 2 | 1558992360787455_1559015014118523 | He talks about every nationality and woman , disabled , veterans  than when some one had enough of his insults and wants to show him its enough and has to run in hide . He needs to shut up and either drop out or take that chance if he is president
16 | Deborah Moses | 8 | 1558992360787455_1559009167452441 | They probably staged it to take media time away from Katy Perry and Hillary. This is a guy who used to pretend to be his PR person and call up reporters to give them tips on him. Timing is suspicious.
17 | Gretchen Boyd Petry | 3 | 1558992360787455_1559003717452986 | If there was really a weapon there, or some guy who was really dangerous, do you think all this people close to him would have stuck around to watch?
18 | Cees Mouthaan | 18 | 1558992360787455_1558996070787084 | Looked like he had a lot of experience being bent over with a strong man behind him.Came really naturally to him.
19 | Rajesh Radhakrishnan | 2 | 1558992360787455_1559009240785767 | This is reality TV at its best. Is this the second surprise that Giuliani predicted in Wednesday before Comey"s letter fiasco?
20 | Liz Pe√±a | 2 | 1558992360787455_1559007600785931 | It's very unfortunate.However, with Thumper, creating ALL this hatred and animosity, what did he except?! Perhaps, this incident will cause him, to humble himself......
21 | Mel Rubio | 30 | 1558992360787455_1558994107453947 | Their putting up a show... So he can radle the deplorables all staged mofo ... #Fucktrump2016
22 | RoseMary Frisone-Visser | 2 | 1558992360787455_1559015797451778 | Very sad that Trump has advocated violence throughout the country. As usual, it's everyone else's fault. You Trump supporters have no problem dishing it out, but can't handle when it's thrown back at you.
23 | Constance A Marshall | 0 | 1558992360787455_1559019837451374 | Not to downplay the security scare but I wouldn't be surprised if this was staged by Trump campaign to show he can handle pressure! This seems like a stunt to me & if it's looped for the next 3 days I know  correct!
24 | Susan Rehman | 1 | 1558992360787455_1559014487451909 | Haha. He looked frozen, bent over (maybe he thought he would get shot like his supporters are threatening to do to HRC) and could barely lurch away from the podium!  I would normally be appalled and sympathetic.....normally.
25 | Eve Maria Bridgeforth | 5 | 1558992360787455_1559008367452521 | God knows I don't wish any harm on either candidate..but unlike other incidents at Trump rallys, this incident looked really staged to me. IJS

1 | James Hastings | 20 | 1557912510895440_1558974230789268 | Pence is running for vp because he couldn't get reelected dog catcher in indiana because he has so thoroughly damaged the states reputation. The country really grew to hate the cheneys because they were so right wing and so dogmatic, but governor pence is far more socially right wing than dick cheney ever was, sorry to be so rude but he really is just a little nazi, he doesn't care about anybody and wouldn't care if he locked up half the state if they didn't abide by his radically nutty social agenda, he has absolutely no conscience what so ever. Like trump he simply reflects the most radically right wing part of the republican party. http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/columnists/matthew-tully/2016/07/14/tully-dear-america-mike-pence/87093704/He took a state that was economically doing incredibly well but whos state govt was fiscally already under funded and just drained the life out of it. Socially he sent the state back 30 years and indiana became a laughing stock of the nation. Again he doesn't really care who he hurts or imprisons as long members of his violently right wing evangelical church agree with his actions. He grew up in an irish catholic family and for strickly political purposes he abandoned his faith to join an extremely right wing evangelical church whose denomination has always had a history of denouncing and persecuting roman catholics and anyone who is different. He's singularly advocates policies that call for hatred and discrimination against gays and lesbians and if given the choice he probably would lock up half the LGBT community in indiana. He hates mexicans and calls immigrants criminals.  I'm sorry but governor pence is really terrible. To turn our back on the immigrant and the refugee and those who are exiled, we turn our back on her; liberty, the mother of exiles. For she faces the world to welcome it, for ALL those who seek freedom. For as americans we should all read and reread this poem and always take it to heart. https://www.nps.gov/stli/learn/historyculture/colossus.htm
2 | Diana Cox | 14 | 1557912510895440_1558973030789388 | These trumpsters are like little parrots...repeating all the birdbrain ideas that fall out of the yams mouth. Cant wait til these lemmings follow him off a cliff.....counting down the minutes
3 | James Hastings | 14 | 1557912510895440_1558974657455892 | TrumpMy response to those who are enthusiastic supporters of donald trump is; every democrat in this country is laughing at you, half the republican party finds you embarrassing, most ordinary people find your views disgusting, every elected official finds your views frightening and the people of world are panic stricken. I would hope that after a  huge democratic landslide in november that you people come to your senses again and start appreciating your country again and loving it's freedom, or else get out of here.https://www.google.com/amp/www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all/ampWhy is it that trump supporters always admonish the rest of us to hate and discriminate against certain groups of people who the rest of us work with, talk with, have as neighbors and friends and interact with all the days of our lives but who trump supporters have never met or socialized with or even said good morning to. Hate if you must but dont condemn the rest of us for not hating because youre hating the people we know and you dont. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/lists/people/comparing-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-truth-o-met/ http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/how-the-hillary-clinton-outrage-cycle-took-over-the-media-w447574http://www.salon.com/2016/10/31/donald-trump-doesnt-really-give-away-money-and-when-he-does-he-benefits-from-it/To turn our back on the immigrant and the refugee and those who are exiled, we turn our back on her; liberty, the mother of exiles.

4 | Joe Apel | 6 | 1557912510895440_1558976440789047 | Republicans should be really worried about this. This definitely shows that the future is heading in a Progressive direction. Now we just need the old bigots to die off.
5 | James Hastings | 6 | 1557912510895440_1558974494122575 | Trump is severely learning disabled and because of that disability he not only can't read very well, he can barely read and write. The teleprompter that he now uses runs very slowly for trump, but even when the words are barely moving he can barely read it. His speeches are written at a fifth grade level and even at that child like level he has to practice reading them repeatedly. Again he can barely read and write, when he speaks off the cuff his grammar is so bad and so disjointed that at times he's almost incomprehensible.http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/30/donald-trump-in-1990-adultery-is-not-a-sin.htmlIn school trump consistently made bad grades and was always being called out by teachers for inattention and he would often just not show up to class. It's a combination of never being able to read very well, being ADD and growing up in a family where every wish was given into and where even his teachers tended to bend over backwards to please the family. So his inability to read turned into an inability to learn and hence he doesn't know or care much about the world. Hes always been to able to counter his obvious inability to know much about the world by hiring people who do. But the presidency demands a singular ability to know something about the world and at least a rudimentary ability to communicate, and he simply cant.http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_580d458de4b0a03911ed69b6To get thru high school and college and business school trumps father had to hire dozens of tutors, his father's  http://fortune.com/2015/08/14/donald-trump-wharton/ organization was constantly talking to professors and deans cajoling and convincing them to have his son pass courses, courses that he nenover studied for because he hated reading because he can't read very well and he can't concentrate on anything for more than 10 minutes because always hes had extreme attention deficit disorder. http://www.salon.com/2011/05/03/donald_trump_wharton/  http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/11983400 http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/lists/people/comparing-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-truth-o-met/He couldn't take exams and failed weekly tests and was only barely passed by those schools by his father by both throwing money at the schools and threatening them. He's always had people to write everything for him and read everything. As president as wouldn't know the first thing about anything in a cabinet meeting. https://www.google.com/amp/www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all/amphttp://worldofwonder.net/fran-leibowitz-donald-trump-hes-poor-persons-idea-rich-person/He has a very rudimentary understanding of domestic policy because he does watch the news but because he really didn't have any education despite the schools he went to his knowledge of the world is just terrible. His understanding of the world is comparable to someone who is completely illiterate. People don't understand that trump never had to work hard or do anything to improve himself and because had he such terrible learning disabilities at such an early age he simply refused to read and write and nobody made him do that. https://www.google.com/amp/www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-donald-trump-losing-garrison-keillor-20160831-story,amp.htmlPlease repost.  Sir I was dyslexic too in school, I just had to study twice as hard as everyone else, but I did. Trump didn't study and didn't read and his parents didn't care and look at him now, Nelson Rockefeller also came from a wealthy family he was so dyslexic that he could never read his speeches, he had to memorize all his speeches before he gave them, but he was highly educated, unlike me he had to study four times as hard as everyone but he knew the world so completely and read all the time and wrote volumes albeit very slowly and he was a great governor and a great vice president. http://qz.com/824550/samantha-bee-comes-up-with-a-new-us-election-conspiraAND PLEASE THIS AS A WARNING AND REPOST. http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/u-s-election-2016/1.749153
6 | Stefan HG | 4 | 1557912510895440_1558971300789561 | Our Democracy is a scam! We have criminally investigated and corrupt Hillary Clinton RIGGING this election in her favor. The media's crooked, running one sided stories. The President's running throughout encouraging illegals to vote. Democrats are opposing fair elections by opposing basic identification requirements! We're officially a 3rd world Oligarchy!
7 | Dayna RathmanFamily | 0 | 1557912510895440_1558988277454530 | How can I vote for a man like Trump? If he put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump.
8 | Ami L. McChesney | 0 | 1557912510895440_1558987607454597 | Young kids should not be voting for actual candidates. Learning to be a responsible voter means you study issues thoughtfully. Young kids should practice voting on topics important to them. Kids who vote for actual candidates often do not know why, repeat talking points they have heard from others (often not appropriate for their age), or vote on a whim. Candidate voting should be for older students.
9 | Denise A Spencer | 13 | 1557912510895440_1558971580789533 | Republicans push racists restrictive voter ID to suppress the minority vote in many states. They are closing poling places in minority communities and using poll watchers to challenge everyone to create long lines. They are using their racists cross check system to remove millions of minorities from voter registration. Republicans are rigging the election.
10 | Danielle Button | 1 | 1557912510895440_1558978790788812 | That kid election is bull. My daughters school did it, and everyone in her class voted for Hillary because one little girl cried and said Hillary was her grandma. It was the teachers idea to have everyone vote for her to make the little girl happy.
11 | Tiffany Bryan | 1 | 1557912510895440_1558978694122155 | Too bad we can't predict the actual election - it'll be interesting to see if Jill Stein can at least get 5% of the votes so the Green Party can obtain federal funding next go around.

14 | James Hastings | 0 | 1557912510895440_1558974810789210 | When it comes to immigration what should be our response be to those who go on about those who are breaking the law. Well the law that insured that southern society was separate but unequal was bad law, the law against alcohol in the 1920s was bad law. For one thing immigration law is civil law not criminal law, and it's bad because it mandates only so many people, way too few for the law to work properly. If you have laws and people just overwhelm the laws but still the general population is not harmed by it, then change the laws to where it meets people real consensus and solves the problem. Conservatives seem to love economic freedom as I do you but as for immigration they want a command economy in people. Water seeks it's own level, we know we can't block water because at some point it overwhelms us like it did in new orleans after the hurricane. We have to work with mother nature to let it in gradually flow in. Well the movement of peoples  is the same thing. People come here regardless of whatever dykes, fences and walls we put up. Why don't we let in three or three times as many legally and he won't have a problem with "illegal" immigrants. Our corporations are fleeing from the us for less expensive places to call home, so many people on the left are calling for their punishment and they want a hard line when it comes to punishing corporations by jailing people and arresting people. But really what it is, is that the average corporate tax in europe is 30% our rate is 45%. Why don't we just bring the corporate rate down to European levels and theyll come home. It's very simple, it's very peaceful. Instead of locking up everyone and punishing everyone, just lower the rate a bit. It's the same thing with immigrants. Just increase legal immigration from a million every year to three million and the problem will be solved. We need immigrants for every reason. It's who we are as a country. Next time anytime people go on about how terrible a situation is, think of the easiest and most peaceful and humane way of solving it. Nobody wants everyone arrested, locked up, thrown out and millions of lives ruined. This country should be about empowering lives and not ruining them whatever the current laws entails.

I have two friends who went school with trump I know what I'm talking about, I also have friends in the foreign service and watched what happened in libya with my own eyes again I know what I'm talking about. As for immigrants that's common sense, everyone should be treated like a human being. Senator kaine is by far the best choice for VP for all sorts of reasons, he was Jesuit educated and went to Harvard law school, he is a civil rights lawyer, he's smart, he knows this world so well, hes experienced and in all his adult life he's made it a priority to help immigrants, refugees and especially the black community in their age old struggle for equal justice, equality and economic opportunity in this country, as a civil rights lawyer he's defended the most vulnerable and those are persecuted.  http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dem-vp-candidate-tim-kaine-heads-church-sings/story?id=40837086He's a devout catholic and has chosen to attend a very special african african parish in richmond for decades, he a member of the choir at st. elizabeths. He speaks spanish fluently and has a special affinity for the hispanic community and their struggles in life. . He was the very first high level official to endorse barack obama when almost nobody knew who barack was and the two of them have remained very close life long friends. He has no enemies and is extremely popular and is loved by everyone. He's happily married, hes extremely honest, highly ethical and despite his dull reputation, he's been on everyones list as potential vp choice, including even bernie sanders, because he and his wife are some of most popular, affable and beloved couples in washington. Again in all his career he has made it a priority to always, always help those who struggle whether it's those who are homeless, african american, immigrants or refugees especially those from mexico and latin america. He's one of the brightest, most exceptionally honest and ethical politicians this country has seen in a very long time. http://www.npr.org/2016/07/22/487120976/tim-kaines-pastor-describes-the-veep-picks-life-as-a-devout-catholicGenerally he's not well known outside the Washington beltway and that's too bad, he should be and now he will be because as everyone knows in both parties he's one of the brightest and most unbelievable individuals in politics we've seen since barack obama. Those sanders supporters who oppose this choice should do their research and get to know who senator kaine really is because there is no individual who is more honest and capable whose whole political career had been spent helping people.  https://www.google.com/amp/wtvr.com/2016/07/24/richmond-church-shows-support-for-tim-kaine-family/amp/Something about hillarys faithhttp://www.cnn.com/2016/10/30/politics/clinton-faith-private/
18 | James Hastings | 1 | 1557912510895440_1558974354122589 | Immigrants We have to stop deportations, for every individual we deport we eclipse a tiny part of the american success story. For every immigrant we send back we decrease american creativity, and ingenuity. For every immigrant we arrest we lessen everything we love about this country. For what conservatives don't realize is a free flowing border and liberal immigration policies do more for this countries economy than a thousand tax cuts. Very very liberal and humane immigration policies add so much in every way to this countries economy, society and culture. http://abc7chicago.com/archive/6721968/ To limit immigration is to limit americas greatness, it's power, it's potential, it's inventiveness, its humanity. You hollow out its freedom. Let's stop deportation, let's create a free flowing border and let's welcome all who come here because it's the immigrant that makes this country great. http://www.wsj.com/articles/george-p-shultz-getting-at-the-roots-of-illegal-immigration-1425600501If illegal immigrants are breaking the law on immigration only but otherwise are good, hard working people, why does anyone really care about their lack of status? How are they hurting anyone without status? Again why does anyone care if they are here illegally?  http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/cutting-immigration-myths-down-sizeIt sounds like certain people just want to hate hispanics and to bully people, innocent hardworking people, good church going people. Certain people just want to bully other people? People who live in the shadows of life. Hispanics feel bullied by trump, they feel bullied because he and his supporters call them criminals and thieves and are hated for simply wanting to stay here and make something of themselves. If for some reason anyone really does care for people who are here without status, like so many of us do, what do you do then? You work tirelessly to give them status and to reward them and you fight to give them the right to be free. You don't kill people and destroy peoples lives inorder to take away their handicap. http://reason.org/studies/show/immigration-policy-open-bordersYou help people by taking away their handicap, by empowering them. You don't deport people, you reward hard work with freedom, you take individuals who live in the shadows of life and you give them real lives, empowered lives, american lives. For america should be too good a country to send these folks away, for we must always remember that justice in this country should always be about addition not subtraction, again america is great because of what they do; working so very hard to achieve, invest, create and make something of themselves and their families. For america is always freer and made more just and more whole when those who toil in freedoms shadow are finally given their full freedom and are fully empowered. https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2008-spring/immigration-individual-rights/
19 | James Hastings | 1 | 1557912510895440_1558974070789284 | We also have to remember that despite her superstar status hillary has always fought for the betterment of women and children in this country and abroad. http://shewinswewin.org/record-of-achievement/Every trip she has ever taken privately and publicly she has always stopped off at poor villages somewhere along her travels to talk and encourage and help the women of that village. From the time she was in her twenties she has always made a point to help the empowerment of poor women whether in american urban cities or in rural towns in the third world. http://www.marieclaire.com/politics/a23149/the-secret-hillary-clinton-voters/ Her best friend has always been Marian wright Edelman of the children defence fund where she has always been a member. The Clintons raise lots of money both in Hollywood, on main street and wall street but they also do so much with that money to try the help people. There no other candidates who had a more constant progressive voting pattern and there is no other candidate who has more real world experience and who really cares about ordinary people here and abroad. http://www.mediaite.com/online/hacked-emails-show-clinton-campaign-wanted-debbie-wasserman-schultz-out-as-dnc-chair/Everyday I hear from people who say " if we could only have this administration continue for another eight years" well with hillary we can, we really can. From day one of the Obama administration, hillary and so many men and women who worked for her tirelessly all their career have been a major part of the workings of this white house. With hillary as president there won't be much of a transition, basically the same people will be running our govt. And what so many Americans don't realize is that their is govt is doing an absolutely phenomenal job.  https://www.google.com/amp/www.usnews.com/opinion/leslie-marshall/2014/02/19/hillary-clintons-accomplishments-speak-for-themselves%3fcontext=ampEveryone from our  heroic men and women in uniform to the FBI to the foreign service, the white house, the treasury, the FED, and all the other departments are just doing heroic work the likes of which I have not seen in my lifetime. America really is in the ascendancy in the world, our economy is doing really well. Our govt really does know what it's doing and is planning for a more peaceful and democratic world in the future. And hillary Clinton has played a huge role in all this. I support hillary, because I support america, because I support freedom. http://www.theimproper.com/142115/garrison-keillor-backs-hillary-clinton-lauds-work-ethic/Please repostHere are some good articles that explain what the clinton foundation is all about, please read and repost.  http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2016/08/clinton-foundation-controversy-actual-workhttp://www.factcheck.org/2015/06/where-does-clinton-foundation-money-go/http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/9/22/12893444/clinton-foundation-effectiveness https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Opinion-How-to-Understand-the/230745 http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2016/08/clinton-foundation-controversy-actual-workSomething about hillarys faith.http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/30/politics/clinton-faith-private/A powerful essay on trump, please read and REPOST.http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/u-s-election-2016/1.7Please read these stories about libya, it's time for the truth, lets correct the record,  and please read and then repost.

24 | James Hastings | 0 | 1557912510895440_1558975027455855 | I don't want a president who is practically illiterate,  and I  know he doesn't  know how to read and write very well I have two friends who went to school with him. And yes I will criticise someone who is practically illiterate and doesn't know the world at all if he is running for president. Trump is stupid but really just reflects what his supporters think, like today trump is making the link beween the FBI and the justice department and saying everything is rigged, just picking up on the fact that trump supporters haven't a clue about how the justice department works. Again are you all completely stupid?  The other day I did a search for libya and mainly just mainstream media stories came up, the same thing with tripoli, I put in benghazi and every rightwing nut came up. The majority of trump supporters don't even know anything about libya, so many have never even heard of it but when you put in benghazi they then just parrot all the stupid and totally inaccurate narratives about what happened in 2012. http://qz.com/824550/samantha-bee-comes-up-with-a-new-us-election-conspiracy-theory-on-full-frontal-donald-trump-cant-read/They know nothing about libya and are dumbstruck when someone says tripoli or qaddafi, but when reminded of the word benghazi they just parrot the same garbage regardless of the real facts. Sir I was dyslexic too in school, I just had to study twice as hard as everyone else, but I did. Trump didn't study and didn't read and his parents didn't care and look at him now, Nelson Rockefeller also came from a wealthy family he was so dyslexic that he could never read his speeches, he had to memorize all his speeches before he gave them, but he was highly educated, unlike me he had to study four times as hard as everyone but he knew the world so completely and read all the time and wrote volumes albeit very slowly and he was a great governor and a great vice president.

1 | Lyn Harris | 110 | 1557712484248776_1558912347462123 | I will miss President Obama and his family every day. He is a class act and a caring president. Thank you for the last eight years.
2 | Diane Landi | 75 | 1557712484248776_1558900294129995 | My goodness I just love my president. Think about how lucky we are as a nation to have the kind of democracy we have. To be able to elect such a good man as this. To have a 2 party system that has elected George Bush and vote for someone like  Ralph Nader. And then to someone as bad as Mr. Trump. But for now we are a democracy. Until November 8th if Mrs. Clinton gets elected we will continue to be a great democracy. Let's keep this mans legacy going. Vote. I'm with her!!!
3 | Keith Sullivan | 23 | 1557712484248776_1558894184130606 | Yep... golfing and crooning. He has perfected both. Because he spends almost all of his time working on his Hobbies. And he never let the pesky job of being president of America and the leader of the Free World get in the way of a good Harmony and round of golf.
4 | Gayathri Ganesh | 14 | 1557712484248776_1558895880797103 | I don't why Obama signed the Monsanto protection bill allowing more GMO into our food! I thought he cared for these things.

6 | Brad May | 5 | 1557712484248776_1558921507461207 | Trump is an adulterer and his wife is an illegal alien (she lied about not working in us illegally on her citizenship application.. so it should be voided) and NO one is reporting it.. If trump wins, the media is at fault.. all of it.

9 | Neici Darkandlovely | 3 | 1557712484248776_1558953620791329 | People can hate his color, his policies or the simple fact that he won TWO terms as president, but it won't ever get better than this. He made History in so many ways. Thumbs up üëçüèæ POTUS. You did that.....with Class. I'm happy to say you made us proud, even with so much hatred against you.
10 | Michael Stevens | 20 | 1557712484248776_1558894090797282 | Yea he prob would have been a much better entertainer than a President! He is pretty artful at playing the crowd much like a con artist but a lousy President tho!
11 | Joseph Matthews | 3 | 1557712484248776_1558922594127765 | Just watched a snippet of a typical one-sided MSNBC "discussion" related to conservative Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke's backing of Donald Trump. The sheriff tells other black people they too can get off the plantation, known as drug-infested, violence-ridden, homicide crazy public-housing communities. Instead, the all-liberal African-American panel does not discuss Sheriff Clarke nor Donald Trump's point that Democratic-led cities have horrendous schools in their inner-city neighborhoods, absolutely no jobs in their poor communities and those citizens are subjected to brutal violence every day of their lives. MSNBC is afraid to allow some of those they would label as Uncle Toms to join the discussion perhaps because they would have to hear the truth that the upper-crust Democrats like Hillary Clinton care nothing about helping them, but instead only come calling once every four years. How's that working in the poor inner-city communities?
12 | Linda Johnson | 2 | 1557712484248776_1558910714128953 | Just watched your station MSNBC the most biased station on tv. I am disappointed what the heck happened to real reporting. Some black woman reporting polls falsely. Look at them all and the candidates are so close and she is talking about how Trump will act when he looses, I don't think he will and if he does I hope he goes after Washington and all the crooked, evil people that are there.
13 | Tony Lee | 1 | 1557712484248776_1558957437457614 | Obama Has sold out America Trump said it today he want's to give America back to the people and stop sending job's out of our country.Watch TV look at Chicago and inner city's instead of sending money every where else he want's to spend here.
14 | Linda Johnson | 3 | 1557712484248776_1558911597462198 | You never talk about all the corrupt, stupid, mean and true and proven true lies that Hillary has said. Guess morals does not matter to any of you. Can't believe how awful this country has become.
15 | Mary McCarson | 4 | 1557712484248776_1558911984128826 | I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste from a fellow deplorable Trumpians
16 | Marcia Bryan | 0 | 1557712484248776_1558924147460943 | I've been watching MSNBC for days now...I mean literally DAYS!  I've already voted in NC where I live and none of this stuff has changed my mind from the beginning...it seems this country is on drugs...I don't mean something like weed...I mean like LSD...I'm 65 and remember the 60's and 70's very well...imagine it--a 65-year-old who can remember those years for many reasons; there are lots of reasons to forget them like the Vietnam War.  AND here we are--bring on Dr. Phil, maybe I can get back to normal.  His guests are usually nuts and it makes me feel normal to watch the screwed-up folks that come on his show but it will be so nice to see him/them again next week speaking of what one needs to get back to sanity and then taking Robin's hand as he walks off.  Are they immigrants?  Maybe they're running from ICE!
17 | Nickolas Payovich | 2 | 1557712484248776_1558925474127477 | It is unbelievable that Michelle Bernard, a guest on Racist in Chief - Joy Reeds show, asks if African American Sheriff David Clark has looked at his skin color lately, followed by the all black panel laughing. My God, now MSNBC has stooped so low that if you look at your skin and your skin color happens to be black, you have to vote for Hillary Clinton. If this conversation was reversed, Joy Reed would be out raged beyond belief. What is really outrageous is "vote shaming" African Americans into voting for Hillary Clinton. Also insinuating that African Americans are not smart enough to make up their own minds if they disagree with Joy Reed and her all black panel. Sickening & Despicable.
18 | Joseph Timothy | 3 | 1557712484248776_1558906654129359 | the last 4 years have been a big lie from the democratic side and the president knows this I hear there is democracy for the world except for the protesters in north dakota and NO NEWS COVERAGE AT ALL   there must be shame and the truth is being told over in standing rock.

Now there is PROOF Hillary has accompanied Epstien to Orgy Island where there are underage boys and girls for sex and everyone is ok with that? There is also proof she is into satanic crap and still you all support her? Kinda sick if you ask me! Pedophiles for Hillary! üëèüëè

2 | Rosalyn Gardiner | 114 | 1557917234228301_1558804564139568 | You know how you Trump supporters are always saying, ‚ÄúHe tells it like it is‚Äù? Let me remind you of something. Racism is not new. Xenophobia (the dislike or suspicion of anyone not from your country) is not new, either. These things have been around for centuries. We all have them inside us, but we keep them under wraps. You know why? Because we are civilized! Civil-ized! We know not to walk around mouthing obscenities or insults or racial slurs‚Ä¶we know we have to live together on this one planet; there is nowhere else to go. In the past, when we let those racial insults enter into our daily interactions with other human beings, wars happened‚Ä¶people were killed or maimed; horrors of ferocious magnitudes were unleashed upon ourselves. So we learned to keep our mouths shut and be civilized toward each other. There is no other way! Those suspicions and disdain will always be with us; what keeps us as decent civilized people is we keep them under control. Under control! Donald Trump urges you to let those racial and xenophobic emotions loose, and you have forgotten why you kept them under control originally. He is not, ‚Äútelling it like it is‚Äù; he is telling it like it isn‚Äôt! And like it should not be! We have come a long way toward being a civilized society; and the rest of the countries in the world all participate in the maintaining of a civilized society. Why would you even consider letting Donald Trump undo that? Don‚Äôt regress into the cave-man anarchy where everything is uncivilized. Get yourself under control‚Ä¶and vote blue.

Our Immigration system could be fixed legally if the old party of ideas were still around, but no. We're going to terrorize the Latino and Muslim communities. Trump also advocates stop and frisk and more private prisons. All these "ideas" are toxic and unthinkable. Hillary is a great candidate. The Breitbart world view is entirely fictional.

9 | Ryan Downing | 8 | 1557917234228301_1558804954139529 | Regardless, Democrats ‚Äî including Hillary Clinton ‚Äî seem to have forgotten their own history of claiming elections are ‚Äúrigged.‚Äù1. 2000: Al Gore and the Florida recount. Yes, Gore eventually accepted the result ‚Äî but only after withdrawing his concession, trying to have the vote recounted only in Democrat-heavy Florida counties, and suing to stop ballots from being recounted. Even after a consortium of media outlets concluded that George W. Bush had indeed won more votes in Florida, Democrats continued to claim the election had been ‚Äústolen‚Äù by the Supreme Court and Bush was an illegitimate president.2. 2004: John Kerry and ‚Äúrigged‚Äù machines. While Kerry conceded the election, he and his running mate continued to believe afterwards that the election had been stolen from them, possibly by voting machines. Elizabeth Edwards said in 2007 that she had been ‚Äúvery disappointed‚Äù in Kerry‚Äôs decision to concede the election. And last year the New Yorker reported that Kerry believed ‚Äúproxies for Bush had rigged many voting machines‚Äù in Ohio, and that he may in fact have won the election.3. 2008: John Podesta and Obama‚Äôs voter fraud. As the Wall Street Journal pointed out recently, President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have suggested that voter ID laws are a way of rigging elections against black people. And while they downplay fears of voter fraud, Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta reported internally (via Wikileaks) in 2015 that Clinton operatives believed that ‚Äúthe Obama forces flooded the caucuses with ineligible voters‚Äù to win the primary.4. 2014: Congress and a ‚Äúrigged‚Äù district system. Thanks to the Tea Party wave election in 2010 in response to Obamacare, Republicans were left in charge of many state legislatures as they redrew congressional district boundaries. Except in a few states ‚Äî such as Illinois, where Democrats drew several Republicans out of their seats ‚Äî that meant Republicans held the advantage in the House. As a result, Democrats complained bitterly that congressional elections were ‚Äúrigged‚Äù against them.5. 2016: Bernie Sanders and a ‚Äúrigged‚Äù primary. Sanders uses the word ‚Äúrigged‚Äù often to describe the economic system. But in 2016, the Democratic Party primary was rigged against him in a political sense ‚Äî both openly, in the party‚Äôs anti-democratic super delegate system, and secretly, through collusion between party officials and the Clinton campaign. Sanders supporters protested at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia against what they called a ‚Äúrigged‚Äù election.Hillary Clinton herself has made at least one similar claim. National Review ‚Äî which officially opposed Trump earlier this year ‚Äî points out that Clinton told a private fundraiser in 2002 that George W. Bush had been ‚Äúselected,‚Äù not ‚Äúelected.‚Äù

4 | Bill Trump | 8 | 1343053042457611_1343090602453855 | Trump has been campaigning by holding 3 to 5 rallies per day, yes "per day", which is not an easy task at all and proves his will to the people and proves he is not lazy. The people at his rallies are energized and  very patriotic as i my self have been to some of them. His messages are uplifting and he is for the people, not hollywood, entertanment, or the sluggish pothetic establishment. The crowds are huge overflows, with most of the time thousands standing in waiting outside. With this said, how come MSNBC ignores these rallies and the excitmemt of the country being put back into the hanfs of yhe people, yep no news from you bias medias at all. Why arent you guys saying anything about our president rallying for hillary yhe last two weeks? With 57million on welfare, 90million out of work, obamacare falling apart, and us being $20trillion in debt, why isnt he giving his in the white house fevorishly trying to resolve these problems???

6 | Carol Rinker Petersen | 1 | 1343053042457611_1343184419111140 | Ann Coulter's Final Argument  ...(9)" Trump is a "racist" because of his plan to remove Muslim jihadists, Mexican drug dealers and rapists from our country."Apart from the fact that "drug dealer," "rapist" and "jihadist" are not races, we didn't do anything to Muslims or Mexicans, except send them billions of dollars in foreign aid. The only "racism" Americans care about is that toward black Americans. We did something to them.Hillary asks blacks to vote for her, then vows to bring in millions of Muslims and Mexicans to take their jobs -- the ones that "Americans just won't do." That's racism. (10) "Trump "fat-shamed" Miss Universe!"No, he didn't -- he saved her crown and she was grateful. It‚Äôs on tape.But more importantly, the Miss Universe in question is Alicia Machado, well-known in Venezuela as a publicity-seeking clown.Machado is credibly accused of: driving the getaway car in an attempted murder; threatening to kill a federal judge; and being the baby mama to drug cartel kingpin Gerardo Alvarez-Vazquez, who was on the State Department's "Most Wanted" list under -- let's see, checking my notes -- Hillary Clinton.Until 1975, everyone would have realized that it's stupid to bring in single mothers with no marketable job skills, to add to the dependent class. If we did bring them in, politicians wouldn't proudly introduce them at rallies.But Machado is Hillary's model immigrant. Her only job skill is voting. Upside: Hillary gets another vote. Downside: You'll be supporting Machado and her anchor baby for the rest of their lives, America...."(See more)--http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2016-11-02.html

If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump.

The non-profit paid him an annual salary of $100,000 to oversee the Fund, according to pay records attached to the Podesta emails.The Florida Elections Commission found that Villain also had violated state laws in 2001 when he did not file donation reports for the Haitian-American Political Caucus, a political committee where he was listed as treasurer.‚ÄúThis cries out for an audit or an investigation,‚Äù said Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center a Virginia-based watchdog group. ‚ÄúIts director was in bankruptcy and there‚Äôs almost nothing in the public record showing what happened to the millions of dollars it supposedly was going to use to help poor Haitians.‚Äù  NY POST

1 | Paige Turner | 88 | 1343026689126913_1343035772459338 | Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!

The reason was that Donald Trump answers questions really fast without hesitation. The location was a closed steel mill factory. The News Reporter never mentioned that Donald Trump used Chinese Steel....which resulted in him losing his job in the first place.

7 | Bill Trump | 0 | 1343026689126913_1343091759120406 | Trump has been campaigning by holding 3 to 5 rallies per day, yes "per day", which is not an easy task at all and proves his will to the people and proves he is not lazy. The people at his rallies are energized and  very patriotic as i my self have been to some of them. His messages are uplifting and he is for the people, not hollywood, entertanment, or the sluggish pothetic establishment. The crowds are huge overflows, with most of the time thousands standing in waiting outside. With this said, how come CNN ignores these rallies and the excitmemt of the country being put back into the hanfs of yhe people, yep no news from you bias medias at all. Why arent you guys saying anything about our president rallying for hillary yhe last two weeks?

We are simpletons to believe that Russia, China, and Iran do not have her "bleached bit" emails she was sending and receiving on her unsecure server. She would be the first official that foreign governments would attempt to hack into. If she is President, they WILL black mail her. She is way too careless to lead this country. She placed America at risk. It's on her. She chose to place us at risk  She's too smart to "not" realize what she was doing.

17 | Kathy Crest | 3 | 1343026689126913_1343054189124163 | This is why. Our FBI agents are slowly leaking the truth about the Clintons and what they found on Anthony Weiner's laptop. They now have more evidence than they could ever need to prosecute them and many others. Child sex trafficking and sexual abuse against minors are two of the most sickening crimes these two have committed. The rest of the corruption doesn't even cross my mind anymore. I cannot get the picture out of my head of innocent little children being tortured and raped while these maniacs perform Satanic rituals. I understand the FBI is in a difficult position. The DOJ is blocking an investigation. Obama is involved in the corruption, although I don't know if he is involved in the pedophilia. I have heard that the DOJ is threatening, actually blackmailing the FBI and NYPD with reopening a case that involved a black man who was selling cigarettes outside a local store and was taken down by several cops after resisting arrest. I don't know what the DOJ has over the police officers, but NOTHING they have can even come close to what this case with the Clintons proves. The American people are catching on as the stories are circulating the internet. Those of us with morals and who can't stomach the thought of the Clintons stepping foot in our White House, are NOT going to allow it to happen. I don't know what you people in law enforcement are going to do, when you are going to release the truth, or even "if" you are going to, but all I can say, is you better be prepared for one hell of a war if you don't. And then this country will be faced with a nuclear war because Obama is crazy enough to start one just to avoid being prosecuted himself. He will go hide in another country where he has bought property while the rest of us fry. I am begging you people to do the right thing. With just 3 days to the election, you have to stop this madness. You cannot allow this evil to take control of our country, because we may not ever have the chance to take it back. God bless America and God bless all the children who have lost their lives to these monsters.

24 | Jamela Khan | 1 | 1343026689126913_1343056972457218 | "The same phenomenon is taking place all over the Western world, as demagogic white nationalists rise, elites falsely predict their loss or play down the ramifications of their win, and hate crimes explode once victory is achieved, as witnessed in post-Brexit UK. It was all predictable, but now there is no clear organized process to stop it. Instead, victimized populations wait for their hardship to be taken seriously, and wait, and wait. Meanwhile, in the confusion and inertia, white nationalists consolidate their power.The tyranny of the mob is enabled by those who refuse to recognize the threat and who avoid discussion of the racial enmity at its coreI do not know what kind of America I will wake up to November 9. But I know that the result of the election does not hinge on Election Day. What happens to the U.S. will be the cumulative effect of a campaign that has mainstreamed bigotry and is now mainstreaming ‚Äì or at least severely playing down ‚Äì white supremacist violence.Trump never specified what era he was referring to when he said he would ‚ÄúMake America Great Again.‚Äù Many assumed it was the 1950s, when job growth for whites was high and civil rights were denied. But when I visit Lovejoy‚Äôs grave across the river, I am reminded of life in St. Louis in the 1830s, of the mob violence that preceded the Civil War, of the way Lovejoy tried to convince people that non-whites were human and white mobs were a dangerous problem, and how he anticipated his own death as a result of these toxic politics. His era was one in which white men could attack non-whites with impunity, and those who defied them faced terrifying consequences. It would have been a great era to be Donald Trump."https://thecorrespondent.com/5575/our-fate-was-sealed-long-before-november-8-and-not-because-the-elections-rigged/1576889402275-7591b019
25 | Vince Kauffman | 1 | 1343026689126913_1343056592457256 | It's amazing to see how much money preppers spend on this nonsense. Which, of course, is the point- instill fear, stoke that fear, then get it raging during a national election so people spend money.The NRA uses the same scare tactics to gin up sales for the gun industry. They must know that Clinton is going to win, because the typical gun grab nonsense is beginning again. Pretty soon, the rubes will be paying $1500 for an AR style rifle that normally retails for $699.

A slew of law suits for fraud at Trump Universaty, many bankruptcies ( just take the money & run) , failed marriages, draft dodger. No experience, no plan. Just "believe me", I know more than the military Generals. Trump products all made out of the USA. Don't forget the conspiracy behind everything. Can't wait till this fool disappears into the hole he crawled out of.#NEVERTRUMP

3 | Pat Horodyski Phillips | 30 | 1342920065804242_1342971865799062 | I will be glad when this is all over and Trump can sit in his Trump Plaza Tower and blame everyone for his losing and he will never blame himself. He just makes me sick.
4 | Jeanne Clevenger | 22 | 1342920065804242_1342969972465918 | Someone asked me how could I support Trump, a ‚Äúmisogynist, a racist and a bigot‚Äù.Here is why...Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think. Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.  Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race. Because the Obama/Hillary regime have pissed off countries like China and Russia and thanks to their incompetence we are closer than ever before to a global confrontation which could likely lead to nuclear war. Meanwhile Trump wants to work with Russia and find compromise unlike Obama and Hillary who stupidly and foolishly believe that they can bully Russia into submission.Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe? Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.Because I fear for my family‚Äôs safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues ‚Äì which is a threat to our way of life. Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them. Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.  Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries. Because, unlike Hillary, he has actually created jobs, worked hard and achieved success. And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.
5 | Lisa Conner | 25 | 1342920065804242_1342971369132445 | I saw her interview regarding the way in which Trump tried to get out of paying her the millions that he owed her. She fought back by suing him, and won. Trump was ordered by the court to pay her everything. She got justice - and after a lengthy period finally received the money due to her.
6 | Lynn Taylor | 17 | 1342920065804242_1342921742470741 | WHY ARE THERE SO MANY DEPLORABLES???(I am not the author)That is a question many are asking.  This is one of the main reasons. ......I know a lot of people who are planning to vote for Trump & they don't necessarily like him that much, they don't necessarily agree with him on everything, they are not racist or rednecks but are actually pretty decent people.After talking to many of them I wanted to write this.    Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club & he stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives & said, "if you close these factories as you are planning to do & reopen them in Mexico, I'm going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back & nobody is going to buy them."  It was an amazing thing to see, NO politician, Republican or Democrat had ever said ANYTHING like that to executives such as these & it was music to the ears of the people.  He's saying these things for people who are hurting. It's why the beaten down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump. HE is the human malitaf cocktail  they have been waiting for. The human handgranade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them.  On Nov. 8th, election day, although they lost their jobs, although they've been foreclosure on by the bank, next came the divorce and now the wife & kids are gone, the cars been repo'd, they haven't had a real vacation in years, they are stuck with the s#!+¬• Obamacare bronze plan where you can't even get a f%=#¬£*@ percocet.They essentially lost everything they have......except one thing. The one thing that doesn't cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution,  the right to vote. They might be pennyless, they might be homeless, they might be F'd over & F'd up but it doesn't matter because it's equal on that day. The Millionaire has the same number of votes as the person without a job......ONE, & there's more of the middle class than the millionaire class. So on Nov. 8th the dispossessed will walk into a voting booth, close the curtain & put a BIG F'ing X by the name of the man who has threatened to upend & overturn the very system that has ruined their very lives.......DONALD J. TRUMP.  They see that the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump, Corporate America hates Trump, Wallstreet hates Trump, career politicians hate Trump, the media hates Trump.......after they loved him & created him, and now they hate him. Thank you media. The ENEMY OF MY ENEMY is who I'm voting for on Nov. 8th.  Yes, on Nov 8th you, Joe Blow, Steve Blow, Bob Blow, Betty Blow, Billy Bob Blow......all of the Blows get to go & BLOW UP the whole @$!#@‚Ç©¬• system BECAUSE it's their right.  TRUMPS election is going to be the BIGGEST F YOU EVER RECORDED IN HUMAN HISTORY........AND IT WILL FEEL G.O.O.D!!.............by Michael Moore

24 | Christy Jones Carter | 0 | 1342920065804242_1343182805777968 | I see everyone is upset that nothing *Massive* has been released yet or before the elections....think about it! What would happen if Hillary was arrested right now? How could the election continue with only one candidate...it couldn't! Our country would go into chaos & guess who would still be at the Top.... Obama. The election MUST happen before we can get the true justice. If the elections are rigged & Hillary wins- there will be a coup within our government that will take her down & the majority of our government. For that to happen, we must have a contingency plan in place to seat a person in the presidency who is not corrupt. This has to be strategic and thought out because it must work. If Trump is miraculously elected (that means IF the election isn't rigged) then we have the president seat filled & then HE can help head the whole operation of filling our prisons with these sick, twisted, corrupt pedophiles...like Hillary Clinton!!
25 | Daisy Dillemuth | 2 | 1342920065804242_1342985939130988 | The Clinton's have been around for to long!! Their Clinton foundation, their sex parties with under age children, their lies, their criminal activities must be ended!!! Go to wiki leaks and look it up us all there!!! The Clinton's must never be allowed back in the White House!!! They are under FBI criminal investigation and with no doubt they will be prosecuted!!!

Trump supporters come in 20,000+ with just him at the podium. If I wanted to attend a concert I would a actually pay money for my tickets and go see one.
2 | Annette Ayala | 94 | 1342895905806658_1342907815805467 | Take notes Drumpf! People want to come together for HER!!! Willingly & respectfully!

4 | Andre Ollivier | 32 | 1342895905806658_1342908485805400 | Hillary Clinton needs celebrities to draw a crowd to her rallies.People are showing up for a free concert more than they are there to support Hillary Clinton.Let her try and draw a crowd without a free concert and see what kind of crowd she or KIaine bring in...
5 | Sandra Campbell-Herbert | 8 | 1342895905806658_1342992912463624 | President Obama could draw big crowd ,and the two terms of his presidency he had Stevie Wonder, Bon jovie ,Bruce springstine ,a lot of people performed at his rally in the end because they wait so long ,they just want the crowd to be energies ,you stand on line long ,some times you are there three four hours before the rally starts ,and nobody want to perform for Trump ,he offered Beiber ,five million and he turn it down .
6 | Dominick Borelli | 9 | 1342895905806658_1343005409129041 | Here is a fair question, if Hillary is for woman equality how come a man is running the Clinton Foundation? How come women make less than men in her own foundation??? How come her Campaign Manager is a guy??? You know Trump is the person to hire a women to be Campaign Manager in a Presidential Race. You do know Trump has had many women run companies for him.
7 | Joe Farro | 17 | 1342895905806658_1342903592472556 | I heard an opinion that Trump's weekend plans reflect those of a candidate who knows he's losing and is desperately hoping he can pick up states where his position is hopeless.

I'm just happy I fracking dumped the Democratic Party and switched over but just as soon as this election is over I'm going to register as an independent voter. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
10 | Lu Ball | 9 | 1342895905806658_1342919119137670 | How many Reps will be there for the free show. They can go and then when Hillary begins talking leave. Americans across this nation are fed up. They are fed up with the lies and the double standard. These Americans live in cities towns in rural areas, and some in cars. These Americans are not defined by race, age, gender, creed or sexual orientation . These Americans cross all party lines. These Americans are the forgotten Americans known as the Movement and the Movement has come to elect Trump to drain the swamp. Vote Trump/Pence to drain the swamp of lying crooked politicians like Hillary.
11 | Manny Lopez | 6 | 1342895905806658_1342994839130098 | So sad she needs help, while dumbo don't need it because he is getting his Racist fan base behind him.

He sells , hats, shirts, pins.. and God knows what else. YET.. Sen Clinton gets all these donations from people. . Brings in millions of dollars. . Yet chump can't make much of nothing. . Either 1.

14 | Brian Kincaid | 5 | 1342895905806658_1342904515805797 | Then Erik Prince (former navy seal) said that the rats were scrambling in every direction, ‚ÄúNYPD was the first one to look at that laptop.‚Äù ‚ÄúWeiner and Huma Abedin, his wife ‚Äì the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years ‚Äì have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have ‚Äì they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.‚ÄùPrince continued, ‚ÄúThere is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails they‚Äôve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending/receiving of classified information, up to SAP level Special Access Programs.‚ÄúSo the plot thickens.

19 | Jonthan Gonzalez | 29 | 1342895905806658_1342898565806392 | Is Hillary running for president or a music tour manager. Hillary try to get votes with your own mouth. Not try to undermine citezens and belittle them by believing ill just put a rapper in front and that will do it. Wake up America

21 | Bill Trump | 2 | 1342895905806658_1343092009120381 | Trump has been campaigning by holding 3 to 5 rallies per day, yes "per day", which is not an easy task at all and proves his will to the people and proves he is not lazy. The people at his rallies are energized and  very patriotic as i my self have been to some of them. His messages are uplifting and he is for the people, not hollywood, entertanment, or the sluggish pothetic establishment. The crowds are huge overflows, with most of the time thousands standing in waiting outside. With this said, how come CNN ignores these rallies and the excitmemt of the country being put back into the hanfs of yhe people, yep no news from you bias medias at all. Why arent you guys saying anything about our president rallying for hillary yhe last two weeks? With 57million on welfare, 90million out of work, obamacare falling apart, and us being $20trillion in debt, why isnt he giving his in the white house fevorishly trying to resolve these problems???

22 | Dee Taggart | 0 | 1342895905806658_1342986152464300 | Long ago the democrats in PA figured out that winning Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and their suburbs would cancel out the "T" in the state. It hasn't been red since.

If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump.
25 | Keenan Reese | 1 | 1342895905806658_1343055099124072 | Hillary's just s bad as Obama in their support of locking up people for victimless crime, ( the majority poor minorities ), costing Americans billions, and wasting millions of police hours, which could have been used solving real crime. Trump is saying he will legalize marijuana in all fifty states. Now that would be a legacy to be proud of.

1 | Marion Rohling | 184 | 725926867572341_726319597533068 | We can split hairs all day long, go in to minute details about "she said, he said" ACTIONS speak louder than words! Our President treated this man with respect, unlike how that part of America, that threatens our national security does!
2 | Cheryl-Pete Rosecrans | 81 | 725926867572341_726314044200290 | The Daily Mail has reported this as him becoming angrier and angrier and finally telling people to shut up. Never happened but the rag reported the most twisted way possible and Trumpsters lapped it up. It's mind boggling.
3 | Renee Cadena | 32 | 725926867572341_726351280863233 | Another example of how a true President handles adversity.  A theoretical President Trump would have thrown the man in Gitmo. There is no head scratching choice here. A former Secretary of State or an Orange Nazi who would rather let the tax payer pick up his tabs rather than pay his own bills. If anyone is truly stumped here, you are just intoxicated on the opiod of hate. Turn of the faux news, go commune with nature for awhile.
4 | Shane Jones | 14 | 725926867572341_726332934198401 | Clown Obama cut coal mining and my electric bill went from $60 last month to $133. You're darn right I'm voting Trump.  Those coal worker's have family's and Obama caused them to lose their job. I thought Obama was for Union coal miner's?
5 | Russ Blake | 7 | 725926867572341_726354967529531 | Such a striking difference not only between the two men's ideas of "Presidential", "respect", and "freedom of speech", but also in the reaction of their supporters.  As I knew I would before even reading any comments, I've seen a number of Trump Trolls belittling Obama for being respectful, saying things like "he's insincere" or "he can't even speak his mind because he's a slave to political correctness".  It's "typical namby-pamby liberal bs", and so on.

7 | Joanne Carr Dermody | 12 | 725926867572341_726373040861057 | Trump told a bold faced lie and  gave a very untruthful narrative about that man at the rally.  President Obama was very gracious and said that leave him alone as protesting is o.,k.  Trump always drags them out and  treats them like criminal. I watched it happen. Doesn't Trump ever tell the truth?
8 | Edward Ferrer | 29 | 725926867572341_726313324200362 | " When a guy's ambitious and out in the public arena and working hard, well that's okay. But when a woman suddenly does it, suddenly you're all like, 'Well, why's she doing that?' I'm just being honest. I want you to think about it because she is so much better qualified than the other guy. She has conducted herself so much better in public life than the other guy. This notion that somehow it's hard to choose, it shouldn't be."- President Obama.
9 | Vita Watkins | 6 | 725926867572341_726437720854589 | This is how an adult handles a protester. He does not yell 'get him out' because he can't handle the commentary. President Obama is more of man than that petulant 12 year old Republican candidate.

To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump.

9 | Cheryl Mustain Majkrzak | 3 | 1342830839146498_1342875349142047 | Do you notice there are no achievements for Trump? His businesses go bankrupt, he doesn't pay people who work for him, he cheats on each wife and then marries the mistresses, he creepily feels up one daughter and talks about another's legs and chest in a sexual way when she is a toddler, has many women come forward accusing him of sexual harassment, admits to sexual assault and speaks in very vulgar terms about women, insults veterans, women and others. I'm sure there's more but I just can't think of them all. Oh yeah is endorsed by the KKK and white supremacy groups. These are just a few of the reasons I won't vote for Donald Trump.
10 | CM Moraga | 6 | 1342830839146498_1342864502476465 | And remember When they go Low we go High! Don't give in into the temptation of insulting others. GOTV, vote against violence, hateful rhetoric, racism and ignorance.

They are cooperating with the government. They both have ‚Äì they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.‚ÄùPrince continued, ‚ÄúThere is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails they‚Äôve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending/receiving of classified information, up to SAP level Special Access Programs.‚ÄúSo the plot thickens.

13 | Bill Trump | 1 | 1342830839146498_1343092412453674 | Trump has been campaigning by holding 3 to 5 rallies per day, yes "per day", which is not an easy task at all and proves his will to the people and proves he is not lazy. The people at his rallies are energized and  very patriotic as i my self have been to some of them. His messages are uplifting and he is for the people, not hollywood, entertanment, or the sluggish pothetic establishment. The crowds are huge overflows, with most of the time thousands standing in waiting outside. With this said, how come CNN ignores these rallies and the excitmemt of the country being put back into the hanfs of yhe people, yep no news from you bias medias at all. Why arent you guys saying anything about our president rallying for hillary yhe last two weeks? With 57million on welfare, 90million out of work, obamacare falling apart, and us being $20trillion in debt, why isnt he giving his in the white house fevorishly trying to resolve these problems???

You want to do something...take that federal money we waste and purchase one of the cheap abandoned buildings and make a program for kids with activities, life skills and job skills. Do what we need to for our youth here in our own country! Once that happens in our major cities, then the government can tell me how they support kids and families. Stop talking...do something for once!

20 | Lee Brock | 1 | 1342830839146498_1343040215792227 | Of course the Obamas deserve credit--"It takes a villiage."  But compare that to all the help Trump has had: Extreme right Congress; FBI; Alt-Right; T-Party; and the many witch-hunters behind Whitewater, Benghazi, and the Emails...

1 | Gina Smothers | 73 | 1342772689152313_1342776535818595 | We need to do everything possible to keep the madman out of office. I hope he loses so badly that he will be crawling out with his ego trailing behind him. Keep the progressive agenda. Young people get out and vote. This is about your future. VOTE BLUE. We can do more with our progressive agenda in the office than we can do with it dangling in the hand of an idiot.
2 | Mark Rush | 8 | 1342772689152313_1342803832482532 | Look with all the hype and noise of the last week or so the electoral map has basically remained the same. With all the polling going on the only state where Donald " The Crook " Trump has consistently led a lead is Ohio. But at this stage the only actual factual data that we have is the early voting numbers, and by all indications the Democrats are leading in all the swing states. But unlike the 2012 election no one is talking about the white evangelical vote, where does that vote stand? Maybe that is the reason that Georgia and Arizona are close.

You are driven by greed, you grossly exploit human suffering, you latch on to tragedy like a bear on a salmon, plus you prey on the weak minded with your reality show "news" format. MSNBC, you offer absolutely nothing that can help make the world a better place. You are 100% self-serving and sadly pathetic. Although, I am pretty sure that the corrupt drug companies that are paying you boatloads of cash to be drug pushers would probably disagree with my opinions.

10 | Carol Madsen | 3 | 1342772689152313_1342865055809743 | I've already voted for Clinton.  MSNBC continues to come up with wild Trumplican theories on their electoral college map.  Clinton has a 70,000 vote "banked" vote lead in Nevada, about the same as when Obama had won the state before election day.  Is this "let's keep this sick horse race going for ratings purposes" or just straight up Comcast political bias.

My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary.

The ones who are to respond to her have zero faith yet somehow you think she can make anything better. Haven't the content of the emails prove nothing will be held sacred to Hillary.

"I've never seen a hijabi or a Muslim woman on a billboard in Times Square. That's as big as it gets!"
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | David Parker | 219 | 1342735019156080_1342739195822329 | when this image is on billboards throughout Saudi Arabia, then we can start celebrating
2 | Liza Rodriguez | 149 | 1342735019156080_1342823352480580 | I hate to break this to some of you, but America is a diverse nation. She is just representing her culture as a Muslim American. And she is beautiful. And most women wear makeup for themselves, not for anyone else.
3 | Billie Lewis | 109 | 1342735019156080_1342797189149863 | I guess I don't understand. Muslim women claim they cover their hair for the sake of modesty and they don't want to be noticed by men, but they pile on all that makeup. I believe men do notice that. Religious hypocrisy as usual.
4 | Kathy Crest | 44 | 1342735019156080_1342761949153387 | She is a beautiful woman, but this is American, and Cover Girl is an American business, and American women DO NOT wear hajibs. BUT, if the American people do not stop this madness, women will be FORCED to wear hajibs. Take a look at Dearborn, Michigan. Take a few minutes to go on YouTube and watch some of the videos. The Muslims have completely taken over that town. Their businesses all have signage in Arabic. Their leaders are all Islamic. These people are told by their leaders in mosques NOT to assimilate with Americans because WE are the enemy. They live off welfare, and they receive A LOT of it. They have many wives and MANY children. Then after you watch those videos, go back on YouTube and type in "Islamberg, New York, and watch those videos. This is a "town" of Islamic terrorists who are practicing tactical maneuvers and where NO police or media are allowed. They have been videotaped from above, and you would think you were watching a terrorist training camp in the middle east. Our FBI has told us that we have at least 26 terrorist training camps in America. Why do you suppose they have not been raided? Because we have a president who leads those camps. We have a president who is a MUSLIM EXTREMIST. We have a president who, according to the guest registry of the White House, has had far more visitors from members and leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood than ANY congress member or world leader. Have you seen the Project Veritas videos? Be sure to look those up on YouTube as well. They show the results of an under cover investigation into voter fraud being committed by the Democrats. The ring leader of this operation, a man by the name of Creamer, is a felon, and HE has visited the White House over 340 times, and 47 of those times were a direct meeting with Barrack Hussein Obama! He resigned from his position when the videos came out. His side kick featured in the videos was fired the day after the videos were released. There are 5 main videos that show such unbelievable behavior, yet Fox is the only station to air them. I take that back, CNN did air one of them but instead of focusing on the horrific details of the video, they spoke about the man who did the investigating and made him out to be the bad guy. I guess when you expose crime in this country today, you are not very popular. In fact, this is the same man who exposed Planned Parenthood for selling fetus body parts. What is taking place in our country is a travesty. But thankfully things are about to make a huge change. Our FBI now has a huge amount of evidence against the Clintons and many others in Washington. Sadly Loretta Lynch is standing in the way of prosecuting them. She is protecting them but the American people are not going to allow this to happen anymore. There is evidence that the Clintons and at least 6 others have been involved in child sex trafficking, and the American people are NOT going to allow people of this caliber to occupy our White House again. Anyone who can commit such heinous crimes against children (the FBI has photos of sexual abuse) belong locked away forever. The American people will make sure of this if our justice department refuses to. What kind of nation have we become where the media protects these kind of animals. The FBI has had to leak out this information because our media refuses to air it. It truly is a very sad time for this great nation.
5 | Kathleen Canavan | 25 | 1342735019156080_1342818452481070 | Sorry, this is not fashion to me. :( It feels like celebrating girdles or bustles, something to keep women uncomfortable or just silly in order to make sure they know their place. Just my perspective.
6 | Zoraia F. Moreira | 20 | 1342735019156080_1342820179147564 | American women wear anything they want to wear! Even that if that's what they feel like. Stop the hate! I'm much more afraid of excluding any faith from the dialogue table. The sun rises for everyone and so does the night there is nothing special about any of us... the seasons change every year for everybody 24 hours a day for everyone so grow up start getting along with each other and stop the hate! Stronger together you Americans will find yourselves in a much better place in history.
7 | Marlyn Yeahright | 8 | 1342735019156080_1342811959148386 | Does this woman really think this is progress. They continue to be dominated by men now she wants to be lusted after. Has she not been following the elections. Has she not noticed that women are in a box and if they try to do anything except be appealing to men the lid is tightened. Women like her allows a creep like trumpie to make his digusting remarks. I feel so ashamed that this is all she can aspire to
8 | Nermin Foundas | 9 | 1342735019156080_1342974562465459 | I'm disgusted by the commentary. If you seriously have a problem with it, then don't buy Cover Girl. There's no reason for all the nastiness. What happened to the age of two each their own?
9 | Mary Collins | 8 | 1342735019156080_1342834395812809 | If she truly wants to wear the hijab, then that should be her choice.  I have a problem with women in America, a free country...showing them being forced to wear head coverings because of the dictates of their religion, as decided by MEN.  And not just Muslim...Amish, Mennonite, etc., who have to cover their bodies up.  The other issue is that, in the Middle East, so many women are disfigured with acid or other means when they "disobey", again according to men.  It makes this hard to accept, as any kind of "freedom".  This represents oppression of women, plain and simple.  JMO.
10 | Lance Agee | 5 | 1342735019156080_1342802619149320 | Maybe Hillary could give that money back to Saudi Arabia and get a billboard put up by Mecca. Oh that would mean she actually stood for something, other than crime, corruption, contempt for our laws and pay for play. Notice CCCP for the kids, that references Communist Russia. When politicians are above the law, make hundreds of millions doing nothing, over tax and take your rights away. Until this ad is in the streets of the Middle East and South East Asia don't waste our time.
11 | Lodge Blackman | 2 | 1342735019156080_1342845285811720 | Why is that big and why should any of us care? It's just another girl. I'd be afraid for that girl tbh, in the Middle East Muslim men don't tend to take too kindly to this sort of thing..
12 | MelindanBrandon Handley | 0 | 1342735019156080_1343037679125814 | She hides her hair yet is plastered for everyone to see on a billboard lol How about they post her on a billboard in a Muslim country lets see how that turns out.... She cant bc she would end up dead.
13 | Bill Trump | 0 | 1342735019156080_1343093105786938 | Trump has been campaigning by holding 3 to 5 rallies per day, yes "per day", which is not an easy task at all and proves his will to the people and proves he is not lazy. The people at his rallies are energized and  very patriotic as i my self have been to some of them. His messages are uplifting and he is for the people, not hollywood, entertanment, or the sluggish pothetic establishment. The crowds are huge overflows, with most of the time thousands standing in waiting outside. With this said, how come CNN ignores these rallies and the excitmemt of the country being put back into the hanfs of yhe people, yep no news from you bias medias at all. Why arent you guys saying anything about our president rallying for hillary yhe last two weeks? With 57million on welfare, 90million out of work, obamacare falling apart, and us being $20trillion in debt, why isnt he giving his in the white house fevorishly trying to resolve these problems??? CNN = Clinton News Network!
14 | Kreg Mcmahon | 3 | 1342735019156080_1342851239144458 | I was asked how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughters? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste from a fellow deplorable Trump voter
15 | Fern Manire Porras | 3 | 1342735019156080_1343050519124530 | When the hijab becomes acceptable as optional wear for women everywhere in the world, I'll be able to look at it without seeing the subjugation of women.  Until then, it will continue to be a symbol to me of the ownership of women by a culture who don't value them as equals.
16 | Suzanne Ziesmann | 0 | 1342735019156080_1343210699108512 | Cool. I keep wishing everyone had a chance to live for a while out west..like CA Or CO or NM.......so the concept of living with tons of different kinds of people in close proximity is the norm...and not just on subways n stuff....like, in your schools....everywhere...fairly well integrated in suburban areas....I was not a majority race i.e. Not Over 50% white in either grad school at UCD or living In NM. So many religions...no one seemed to care. It's a non event to me....people who don't look like me. I only care about basics like respect, not dissing me...etc. never was an issue....
17 | Melissa Achey Phillips | 1 | 1342735019156080_1343151965781052 | Beautiful! It's no different than an Asian or African American model. This will be outlawed if Trump becomes president. Who knows, she may even be deported if he "makes America great again". In the very least, I'm sure he will, probably already has, had something nasty to say about it.
18 | Josh Neal | 0 | 1342735019156080_1343153212447594 | Seems to me like that's a huge contradiction to be wearing a Hijab and being a spokesperson for beauty products, sorts of defeats the reason that they actually wear the hijab..
19 | JoAnn Collins Pintz | 0 | 1342735019156080_1343184775777771 | I am confused. I thought wearing the hijabi was part of their religion that forbids women to be adorned or be attractive to men. What is the point of wearing it if you use makeup and wear jewelry?? Isn't that forbidden??  I don't know these people have me confused.
20 | Pattie Savage | 0 | 1342735019156080_1343072419122340 | What in world is wrong with you women? You are so distracted by her head covering you can't see the photo for its' artistic value. I think it's a great looking ad. Stupid people stuck on a flipping scarf. If it were a Hermes Scarf would you all be reacting like this?
21 | Carol Rak | 7 | 1342735019156080_1342768359152746 | This should be a commercial for the terrible plight of women. As long as they wear the hijab, we will be reminded of the misogyny in the world.
22 | Sarah Greenbank | 0 | 1342735019156080_1343190922443823 | What don't people get about someone covering a part of their body out of modesty? Would you ladies be happy to walk around topless? In some cultures breasts are not taboo. Don't you think it's strange to those cultures that you cover yours? Would you like to be told you must uncover your breasts because someone else's culture says you should? It's not that hard to understand. Wearing makeup has no relation to wearing a head covering. Please, stop the ignorance!

1 | Je Deg | 484 | 1342651075831141_1342661009163481 | Ok we get it Trump supporters. Your jealous just go and invite your famous Scott Baio and Antonio Sabato Jr. LOL ! Losers always whine for nothing
2 | Teisha Pillow Havnaer | 251 | 1342651075831141_1342671749162407 | Jay Z and Beyonce are not running to become President of the United States. There is a big difference people. Do not compare Trump's foolishness and lack of preparedness to musicians. The fact that you consider voting for someone who hasn't bothered to try to learn anything about the job he is seeking is absurd. Why don't you have Trump do open heart surgery on you when you need heart surgery? I'm sure him being on reality tv, being a businessman, and quasi rich has well prepared him for that job also. Idiots!
3 | Sharon Dorsey | 84 | 1342651075831141_1342664062496509 | Campaigns in the past have always had stars rally for them! It seems that this year no rock stars wanted to be with Trump! Yes they are rock stars, Americans, and it shouldn't make any difference if they are black or white but it sure does with a lot of the posts!
4 | Steve Bishop | 62 | 1342651075831141_1342659679163614 | What a shallow attempt at the black vote. Why doesn't Hillary talk about how she could help these communities? What exactly has Hillary done over the last 30 years for the black community other than a free concert? Anyone?
5 | Nancy Chamberlin Sprowls | 87 | 1342651075831141_1342652832497632 | Such hypocrisy for the Clinton campaign to bring rock stars to campaign rallies. The language Trump is demonized for is front and center in these stars' lyrics that play over and over again on radio, TV, Pandora, infiltrating our kids' minds. I find Trump's language offensive, there's no way to defend it, but to have the Clinton campaign showcase people whose language and influence is even worse reveals so much. It should disturb us all.
6 | Chad Baier | 46 | 1342651075831141_1342666569162925 | Sweet! Two "artists" i would never introduce my kids to for obvious reasons. How sad and embarrassing it must be for dems to watch their drunk old lady hopeful play the "Hey! We're hip! We're cool!" card. Total. Losers.
7 | Aaron Prince | 57 | 1342651075831141_1342670039162578 | So along with all the racist crap Beyonce had been apart of, cause seems like every democrat forgets you don't have to be white to be racist, she's a sexist too?  And killary praises the extreme vulgarity of Jay z music but just spent a month criticizing what was said in private by trump and still standing by Bill after all he's been apart of...no hypocrisy at all there
8 | Ukeme B Etokakpan | 47 | 1342651075831141_1342662302496685 | And yet, your song lyrics contain profane words, the N word and other negative things.... your videos are even worse...you portray and treat women as sex objects, you project rebellion and drug abuse in your songs... Is that the message people really need?
9 | Laura Coleman | 36 | 1342651075831141_1342657005830548 | Hillary can't get anyone to come unless she brings out these rich elitist. Oh course they come out for her, they never worry about how they are going to pay for their housing, food or electric. They never worry about how their kids are going to get a good education. They never worry about the safety of their families. They don't worry about how they are going to pay for their Obamacare, because they don't use Obamacare! Yet all these elite rich celebrities do show up at all the White Houses fancy events! They do show up in Cuba, and ignore their dictator, so why should they worry about turning us into a dictatorship, where only the elitists matter. Trump gets thousands of all us average Americans. Those of us, Hillary own campaign emails, says she hates. Those of us she calls, deplorables, sexists, racists, and irredeemables. These people have no more of a clue on how the average American lives, or thinks than lying Hillary!
10 | Jacquetta White | 21 | 1342651075831141_1342679285828320 | You clowns need to stop and stop now! Quiet as it's kept, THIS wasn't for you. This was to tap into Beyonce's fan base. You say what you want about them, The Bey Hive is EXTREMELY loyal to their queen. Honestly, it's a very smart strategy.
11 | Amari Taylor | 12 | 1342651075831141_1342673699162212 | No surprise, Hillary Clinton continues to pander to minorities till Election day. So sad how blind some people can be. She has stated many times how stupid Democrats are, especially minorities.
12 | Bryan Nugent | 9 | 1342651075831141_1342690115827237 | If youre voting because beyonce and jay z were with her and not because of what hillary says shows your nothing but a follower and dont believe in the person running for president. If hillary couldnt get your vote on her own then she didnt do her job to satisfy you just like she couldnt do for her man.
13 | Richard Broullon | 13 | 1342651075831141_1342672335829015 | Was I the only one taken aback when that guy being interviewed on Fox's & Friends this morning suggested that if they want a white Supreme Court Justice Man or women then they should vote for Trump. Am I missing something here?Just watch this morning show it was said on live tv. Scary stuff .
14 | Kevin Zito | 4 | 1342651075831141_1342684892494426 | In case you missed last nights  rally, and, Hillary sang along.....!!!!"You're tuned into the motherf----- greatest," a voice said as Jay Z appeared onstage.‚ÄúIf you feelin‚Äô like a pimp n----, go and brush your shoulders off,‚Äù Jay Z rapped. ‚ÄúLadies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off. N----- is crazy baby, don‚Äôt forget that boy told you. Get that dirt off your shoulders."Jay Z also performed the song "Jigga My N----," in which he boasted that he was "Jay-Z, motherf-------!"
15 | Kimberly Mansfield | 8 | 1342651075831141_1342693232493592 | people seem to be mad because it was Jay z and beyonce not Justin beiber lol! Trump doesn't get celebrity support because most of them I seen black white, country music, rap, pop music don't support Trump, Mark Cuban one of the richest men said he whether lose all his money before having Trump as president
16 | Robert Meadows | 9 | 1342651075831141_1342676435828605 | WARNING! Hillary is only bringing out Beyonc√© and Jay Z to get the Black vote. She has absolutely nothing to run on and does not care about anyone. They are rich entertainers and will not be effected by any election. She only wants your vote to win. She will bring more entertainers out in four years and ask for your vote again. Just like Trump has said. She has to bring in famous celebrities, President Obama and Michelle to get crowds over a thousand to show up. She has not laid anything out at her rallies that has any substance. She says "MY PLAN", but what is her plan??????? She has never created ONE job! Trump has created thousands. And contrary to her and the liberal hate spewing Trump has more female executives in his companies than any other firms in the country. Their pay is in most cases above male salaries. Hillary craves POWER only! Ask yourself this!!!!! Do I want to hear a new celebrity in four years and vote for Hillary again or do I want a job in the very near future that pats a salary???? If you want to go hungry, have health care premiums that are above a new car payment then vote Hillary. If you want a job that pays, affordable healthcare premiums, a bright future then vote for Trump!  Remember, Hillary is promising the moon an showing nothing for anyone but will promise to return with new celebrities in four years for your vote again.
17 | Melissa Jennings | 5 | 1342651075831141_1342676002495315 | WikiLeaks is giving us a much clearer picture of the depth of the corruption that is thriving in our nation‚Äôs capital. It truly is a swamp that needs to be drained. And it‚Äôs not just in one party, it‚Äôs widespread. The pervasiveness of this is unbelievable. Our political system is broken, and it will take strong, tough leadership to begin fixing some of this. I encourage you to give it a lot of prayer and get out and vote. I‚Äôve heard of some Christian leaders actually encouraging people to boycott the election‚Äîand those leaders are absolutely wrong. The Apostle Paul was a citizen of Rome and exercised his right as a citizen of Rome to appeal to Caesar. We are citizens of the United States of America, and we need to exercise our rights by voting. We‚Äôve got to let the Christian voice be heard at the ballot box before it‚Äôs too late.Rev Graham.
18 | Ralph Deloach | 10 | 1342651075831141_1342665142496401 | Democratic Party Unity is being displayed by the number of people who are willing to stand with Hillary in support of her Historic Election. Who is willing to stand with Trump? There is no path to 270 electoral votes without the support of every group with the exception of Evangelical Christian Uneducated Older White Men. This is The End.
19 | Jason Knipp | 4 | 1342651075831141_1342679509161631 | If only they knew her tax platform is to tax them a lot more. But wait, for a special donation to my foundation, I'll take care of your increased tax burden. I'll let you know how via email. Lol.
20 | Carol Oberheim Cushing | 3 | 1342651075831141_1826492877596945 | who cares about Beyonce and Jay Z?  I could care less about what they think. Too bad Hlllary can run on the issues she has to bring out "Hollywood", why?  because she has accomplished nothing.
21 | Carrie Tinch | 3 | 1342651075831141_1139548209447910 | We've made history already by electing The First Black President, and he really isn't TOTALLY black. We see the trainwreck that's been. Voting for Hillary just because she's a woman is like eating a turd because it looks like a tootsie roll.One of the biggest problems I have been witnessing is Hillary, Obama and Michelle taking about Trumps negative views on women and how racist he is.Has anyone heard a Jay Z song about treating women like hoes and Beyonc√© supporting the Black Panthers?
22 | Patti Ervin Young | 1 | 1342651075831141_1826499590929607 | Jay-Z is trash. His songs are trash. No political candidate or one holding office should befriend this man. I'm a Hillary supporter but he is trashy and Beyonc√© has become somewhat.
23 | Phyllis Cook | 1 | 1342651075831141_1139522369450494 | After that vulgar monstrocity of a "dress" that Beyonc√© wore at the CMA this week, I'm glad that she dressed appropriately to campaign!  It's refreshing not to  see her thong and girl parts! She looks very nice in this photo!
24 | Lucas Corriea | 6 | 1342651075831141_1342711379158444 | lol don't people see that this is pure marketing and psychological manipulation...they put Beyonc√© in a pantsuit so you would associate her and Hillary as being alike.  In other words, if you like Beyonc√© you should vote for Hillary.  And now MSNBC is blatantly advertising for them in order to distract you from the real issues. Sometimes I feel sorry for our society that is so easily manipulated. SMDH
25 | Blair D. Scott Sr. | 4 | 1342651075831141_1342735065822742 | Don't argue with Trump followers, save your energy and time, for Tuesday if you haven't already "VOTED", and show them and him, he's not wanted as President. He's "Unqualified, Unfit, Unstable", Trump is a modern day, Jim Jones.

1 | Karress Yvette | 2129 | 1557906820896009_1558347980851893 | Because, no REAL celebrity wants to be associated with him in public. Point is they asked, to campaign with her. Celebrities have asked Trump early on to not use their music, etc., without their permission. BIG DIFFERENCE...
2 | Peggy Hardt | 739 | 1557906820896009_1558350647518293 | Why do the people behind him look like hostages?  And, Trump looks (and sounds) more and more like a pouting 4 year old!  'I'm all alone....just me' ......boo hoo!
3 | Paul Rose | 482 | 1557906820896009_1558352080851483 | Because no singers want to be with HIM. Many have even asked him not to play their music at his rallies. They want no association with him at all. I'm sure if he could get them he would be bragging about how much they love him

Trump is a criminal and we as people of this great country should send a clear message Tuesday to Trump and all Republicans no more pay checks for senators and house members that don't work.I think this's candle will be larger than Watergate and people will end up in jail and should.
15 | Julie Ruiz | 36 | 1557906820896009_1558353454184679 | Well, he does have the FBI, Wikileaks, Russia, and a lot of conspiracy sites with absolutely no regard for the truth helping him out.

Hell, he can't even get Republicans out there to help him!
20 | Denise Angel | 17 | 1557906820896009_1866883363598342 | He's right about that. No nothing. He has nothing and never  had anything to bring to the table. People has the right to vote their conscience Mr. Trump. JZ, Byonce, and everyone else, including myself who are voting for Clinton are voting our conscience. If we were voting for you, we would also be voting our conscience, but, to  vote for you, our conscience would be against it. It's as simple as that Dude!
21 | Hararge Oromia Finfinnee | 25 | 1557906820896009_1558381187515239 | All concerned citizens, please, we do not have time to relax, we do not have time to chat on this social media, we are running of time, please, let us work harder than ever these next two days (yes, there is only two days left) We must not take a chance with this rapist (Danonald). We must l, yes must elect Madam President. Let me tell you, the U.S. presodent is not only for America, but for the whole world. Only President Hillary Clinton is the only one who will do this job. My wife and I are doing everything to elect Madam President. Yes, she will be our president and we have to work hard to make this dream come true. Thank you.
22 | Karry Ann Mykonos | 39 | 1557906820896009_1558355510851140 | Three Stooges. Donald Trump wants war on immigrants and any one who gets in his way, Nigel Farage wants a Brexit war, Tony Blair wants a Insurgents war against Brexit, Three men who have not got a clue how to keep the peace. Amazing how people will vote for those three men who want to use Brute force to get their way. Hilary Clinton Welcome Home to the White House. Please let it happen America.
23 | Donna Deflatto | 33 | 1557906820896009_1558365410850150 | Wa, wa, wa, sounds like he is whining. He would jump at the chance of B and Jay and try to kiss B and J Lo. Lying creepy little man-boy.
24 | Elizabeth Murray | 25 | 1557906820896009_1558383360848355 | Don't you know you are are hated for your continued hateful rhetoric and hate. Your supporters are buying into bull.  You know darn well you do not have s clue what's going on nor do you care one bit about them or this country and what it stands for...VOTE BLUE for sanity!
25 | Christina Sorensen | 35 | 1557906820896009_1558360087517349 | Typical Trump is just a mean old jealous man who hasn't fit into any world since the beginning that's why he so revenge taking because none of the establishment people like him and he's not really a billionaire and he still lives in his little mean bully world

The life of a ballot: Here's what happens after you cast your vote: http://nbcnews.to/2fjZYTr
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Paula Raphael Smith | 39 | 1557905987562759_1558285114191513 | The news media showing Wiki Leaks emails where Hillary forwarded classified emails to daughter Chelsea.... you would think just this one email is enough to prove intent.......Where is the justice? Any other person in the U.S. would be criminally charged and their lives ruined, just for that one email. Our DOJ and Obama shamelessly protects her. Sad sad day for our country.
2 | Bernadine Gendron | 4 | 1557905987562759_1558464240840267 | And yet people have been caught shredding at the polls in democrats favor....computer systems changing votes in democrats favor....boxes of ballots stored that are HILLARY ballots only...democrats favor....but Russia's doing it? Nah....the democrats are stealing our democracy right out from under our noses and they are so in our face with it like there's nothing we can do.
3 | S Anne Kribbs | 4 | 1557905987562759_1558365210850170 | Yep, I had a team of both parties and those ballots never left our sight until voting was over & I dropped them off at the county site. In Pennsylvania it would be extremely tough to vote in more than 1 locale or vote as a dead person.
4 | Bill Trump | 0 | 1557905987562759_1558827897470568 | Trump has been campaigning by holding 3 to 5 rallies per day, yes "per day", which is not an easy task at all and proves his will to the people and proves he is not lazy. The people at his rallies are energized and  very patriotic as i my self have been to some of them. His messages are uplifting and he is for the people, not hollywood, entertanment, or the sluggish pothetic establishment. The crowds are huge overflows, with most of the time thousands standing in waiting outside. With this said, how come CNN ignores these rallies and the excitmemt of the country being put back into the hanfs of yhe people, yep no news from you bias medias at all. Why arent you guys saying anything about our president rallying for hillary yhe last two weeks? With 57million on welfare, 90million out of work, obamacare falling apart, and us being $20trillion in debt, why isnt he giving his in the white house fevorishly trying to resolve these problems??? CNN = Clinton News Network!
5 | Paula Raphael Smith | 9 | 1557905987562759_1558303937522964 | Although Trump has gained in the polls, evidence shows voter fraud all over the U.S. You have our president along with all the big corrupt guns out there. She is showing no evidence she is worried. I have been saying all along this elections is rigged....... it is. There is no doubt in my mind HRC will be our next president. Then, she will be indited and impeached. What a shame for our country. What an embarrassment for all the world to see the corrupt society this country has become.
6 | Sandy Bell Small | 5 | 1557905987562759_1558331454186879 | Completely pathetic job this morning at 8:20 of "journalism" (and I use that term loosely) by Thomas someone or other. Constant interruptions and over talking the guest and then an obvious "accidental disconnect" of the guest. If you do not want to hear someone else's views don't have anyone on but yourself.
7 | Kenneth Brown | 1 | 1557905987562759_1558278080858883 | A federal judge in Ohio has slapped the Trump Campaign and dirty trickster Roger Stone with a restraining order for their minority voter intimidation tactics. Judge James S. Gwin issued an order that prohibits the Trump campaign and Roger Stone or his super PAC ‚ÄúStop the Steal‚Äù from seven illegal activities, listed below. Stone did not make an appearance or send counsel. Amazingly, the Ohio Republican Pary avoided being enjoined by the order.Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a statement to Cleveland.com that ‚Äúwith this decision, Ohioans can feel confident that they will be able to make their voices heard in this election.‚Äù Yale educated civil rights lawyer Subodh Chandra gave a play by play of the hearing on twitter, and noted that the Trump campaign had few answers for the judge‚Äôs questions. Chandra‚Äôs conclusions about the voter suppression hearing reflect the new terrain that the Republican party and Trump campaign have blazed in their open desire to suppress the vote:The federal judge‚Äôs ruling prohibits the following illegal behaviors by Donald Trump, Roger Stone and ‚ÄúStop the Steal‚Äù:    a. Hindering or delaying a voter or prospective voter from reaching or leaving the polling place fixed for casting the voter‚Äôs ballot;    b. Engaging in any unauthorized ‚Äúpoll watching‚Äù activities inside of polling places, within one hundred feet of polling places (‚Äúthe buffer zone‚Äù)11, or within ten feet of a voter standing in a line extending beyond the buffer zone.12 Unauthorized ‚Äúpoll watching‚Äù includes challenging or questioning voters or prospective voters about their eligibility to vote, or training, organizing, or directing others to do the same;    c. Interrogating, admonishing, interfering with, or verbally harassing voters or prospective voters inside polling places, in the buffer zone, or within ten feet of a voter standing in line outside the buffer zone, or training, organizing, or directing others to do the same;    d. Distributing literature and/or stating to individuals at polling places, in the buffer zone, or within ten feet of a voter standing in line outside the buffer zone, that voter fraud is a crime, or describing the penalties under any Ohio or Federal statute for impermissibly casting a ballot, or training, organizing, or directing individuals to do the same;    e. Gathering or loitering, or otherwise being present without the intention to vote, at polling places, in the buffer zone, or within ten feet of a voter standing in line outside the buffer zone;    f. Following, taking photos of, or otherwise recording voters or prospective voters, those assisting voters or prospective voters, or their vehicles at or around a polling place, or training, organizing, or directing others to do the same;    g. Questioning, and training, organizing, or deputizing any persons to question voters at Ohio polling places, in the buffer zone, or within ten feet of a voter standing in line outside the buffer zone, under the guise of the purported ‚Äúexit polling‚Äù or ‚Äúcitizen journalist‚Äù operations organized and encouraged by Defendants Stone and Stop the Steal.The Republican National Committee was also in court this morning, and a federal judge in Newark heard both sides of the DNC‚Äôs national action to stop minority voter intimidation under a 1982 consent decree. Spokesmen for the Democratic lawyers said that they were satisfied with the results of the hearing, and that the judge said he wouldn‚Äôt finish ruling today, but that a decision may be disseminated over the weekend in the emergency litigation.The Republican nominee‚Äôs efforts at voter intimidation and a campaign of suppressing the vote are the last refuge of a political loser. More importantly, Trump and Stone‚Äôs actions violate the federal laws meant to protect the right to vote, democracy and civil rights in America for all citizens.
8 | Thomas T. Panto | 0 | 1557905987562759_1558400844179940 | LIES FOR SALE: Although republicans have been lying for decades, they can still win. The good people limit themselves to educating the future of our people by speaking truth , , but to remain in power the corporate owners of the republican religion will make up whatever accusations they suspect might defeat Humanity and allow them to continue operating in America.
9 | Thomas T. Panto | 0 | 1557905987562759_1558432537510104 | It is easier to vote for Russians if you move to Russia. . To know how evil republicans still are, listen to their commercials on TV. They HATE half the population of America and they don't like the other half. . Republicans are now the new ''Plantation Owners'' keeping you as their uneducated obedient soldiers and slaves for their operations in 174 bases overseas.
10 | Ginger Spelts | 8 | 1557905987562759_1558282194191805 | Decades of corruption. Haven't you had enough of it yet? Remember when 70% did not want Obamacare, but they shoved it down our throats. They said we could not even read the bill until they passed it. So much corruption for decades now. Haven't you had enough of it yet? We sat and watched someone commit crimes, lie to congress, lie to the American people, but they are not charged with a crime, because the same laws that apply to you and me, do not apply to them. So much corruption. Haven't you had enough of it yet? I sure have! Vote Trump on Nov. 8th and lets make America great again!
11 | Paula Raphael Smith | 6 | 1557905987562759_1558310304188994 | It's a sad day for our country. The depth of corruption in this country and the over whelming evidence revealing this country is being hijacked by the middle east, yet, more than half of Americans will vote for the treasonous Clinton. There will come a day when they all will regret it and it will be too late for them, their children and their children's children.
12 | Rick Higdon | 0 | 1557905987562759_1558400530846638 | I want someone to explain how a person ( Hillary Clinton ) can get questions and answers to a debate and instead of letting the world know Donna Brazile is trying to help me (Hillary Clinton) cheat....she used them in the debate? And since the world knows this....why is she allowed to continue to run for potus? If your caught cheating is ANY form of race(for the whitehouse or otherwise)you are disqualified. How is it she isn't disqualified. Please explain Hillary Clinton?
13 | Thomas T. Panto | 0 | 1557905987562759_1558489230837768 | For decades Hillary continued supporting Humans in spite of the barrage of lies hurled at her by the corporate owners of the republican religion. While the eye witnesses are still Alive the liars will be opposed.
14 | Edward Ferrer | 1 | 1557905987562759_1558558744164150 | Good people must not remain silent. The Republican Party is poised to elect a man who is legitimizing hate and bigotry in our nation. It is not enough for Democrats to speak out. Their words can too easily be dismissed as partisan politics. VOTE FOR OUR COUNYRY'S SAKE.
15 | Stan Konesky Jr | 3 | 1557905987562759_1558331287520229 | How unprofessional your reporter, Tom, was on Saturday morning on the 8 am msnbc show. He had a NC representative on. She was talking about Saul Alinski and his writings, which is the main interest line for Hillary. Instead of letting her talk, he continuously cut her off and interrupted her. As she continued the network shut her off. Tom then states that God did that. How ignorant he is. Hoe to shut down free speech for his own Hillary agenda. MSNBC and CNN with Brazile just shows that journalism is dead.  No wonder why your ratings are so low and tumbling.
16 | Martha Hoffer | 0 | 1557905987562759_1558840070802684 | THATS  IT! STATES can no longer be trusted to hold elections! We need Government Elections to be held by Our Government and not be trusted to STATE hold elections anymore! Republicans have gone to far!!!! The fact that some States are deliberately not open today says a lot !
17 | Edward E Fisher | 1 | 1557905987562759_1558313037522054 | I could give a flying f.... Any moron that can stand up and defend him is him.ignoreing his mysogynistic views about women, his callous attitude toward organized labor, his multiple bankrupptcies to shield him from his debt  to hard working americans, stiffing the treasury for almost a billion dollars in taxes, etc., the list goes on.
18 | Jerry Rogers | 2 | 1557905987562759_1558297327523625 | Hillary fits the Anti Christ more than Trump if you know anything about scripture. The Anti Christ will be a wolf in sheep's clothing protected by powerful people just like Hillary is she is protected by very powerful people including Obama and the DNC. Trump is too obvious plus he isn't protected by anyone including the RNC. Hillary is known as the Teflon Mom untouchable kind of like Damian in the Omen. Lol
19 | Gail Silva Poettmann | 3 | 1557905987562759_1558338867519471 | I find it so bias that you have "technical" difficulties whenever you have anyone on your show not agreeing with the Hillary Clinton agenda. Wow, way to inform the people. I thought journalists had a responsibility to inform the people of facts, on your network it looks like you cater to your sponsors not the people...
20 | Kathyleen Sherrod | 0 | 1557905987562759_1558316837521674 | From Rev. Franklin Graham: WikiLeaks is giving us a much clearer picture of the depth of the corruption that is thriving in our nation‚Äôs capital. It truly is a swamp that needs to be drained. And it‚Äôs not just in one party, it‚Äôs widespread. The pervasiveness of this is unbelievable. Our political system is broken, and it will take strong, tough leadership to begin fixing some of this. I encourage you to give it a lot of prayer and get out and vote. I‚Äôve heard of some Christian leaders actually encouraging people to boycott the election‚Äîand those leaders are absolutely wrong. The Apostle Paul was a citizen of Rome and exercised his right as a citizen of Rome to appeal to Caesar. We are citizens of the United States of America, and we need to exercise our rights by voting. We‚Äôve got to let the Christian voice be heard at the ballot box before it‚Äôs too late.Like and Share if you agree.
21 | Frank Susi | 1 | 1557905987562759_1558332730853418 | Clinton and the Dems admitting her unsecure unauthorized dirty secret server was hacked by RUSSIA.. then... she.is also admitting she has giving away top US security information ( F.B.I. Confermed classified information as well.!!.)..THATS the real story...Do you feel little has been mentioned about the damedge this causes to America"s security with radical Islamic terrorism????
22 | Cade Foster | 0 | 1557905987562759_1558527360833955 | Corruption has existed since the world was created and there's no surprise it survives through the centuries for human beings have made them a way of life since Pilatus washed his hands at Jesus' trial electing Barrabas to go free even knowing he was the most dangerous criminal - well, it seems history has a way of repeating over and over again though by now we should have learned the lesson and have the courage of doing the right thing by condemning the real criminal that is Trump and electing Hillary who is not helping herself but us .
23 | Edward E Fisher | 0 | 1557905987562759_1558288177524540 | She has been vindicated to date about the stupid emails, Check your own, I sent you a classified email, oh I forgot that was just my opinion of classiffication.
24 | James Kilroy | 3 | 1557905987562759_1558317487521609 | Is Joy Reid related to Donna Brazile she looks like she could be her mama and she just as bias at least fox news tells both sides fairly it's really hard to watch you dirty phonies  Remember HilLIARy took sniper fire like Brian Williams did and he  can't even do the evening news how can she be President?
25 | Edward E Fisher | 1 | 1557905987562759_1558292217524136 | I'll get that guy from the hair club commercial to say" this is my hair and I'll mess it up if I want too." and Donald told him to say that in a secret meeting with Putin in Iran.

( Not on Nov 28 ) Go Hillary Clinton
3 | Valerie Marie | 100 | 1145303848887382_1145362648881502 | Yeah MSBNC, because you all are just a detestable as she is by lying to voters and telling them she's not under investigation. SHE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR SEVERAL CRIMINAL CHARGES.
4 | Glenn Charvat | 40 | 1145303848887382_1145362288881538 | It is obvious that our broadcast and cable news outlets are morally and ethically bankrupt.In the 2012 presidential campaign.Mitt Romney's first TV ad played a clip of Obama repeating a McCain quote as if it was his own.Blatant deception.But you all accepted the money for the ad buy and kept running the spot!And now in 2016,you pass misinformation and disinformation freely! You are no longer a service to the country but rather a destructive force in our democracy.

Trump abuses his power every chance he gets, so I am extremely concern what he will do with the ultimate power!!! Trump communication skills are terrible and he does not represent what this great Country stand for!!! How can anyone support a man that brag about walking in on young pagent girls while changing backstage!!!! I have a daughter and truly embarrass that this man could possibly be Leader of greatest Country on Earth!!!!
7 | Robert Skubinski | 21 | 1145303848887382_1075188399246672 | I really did sit down with a open mind to listen to both candidates. What they are for what they are against, and i'm sorry I can't stomach no more then two minutes of Donald Trump. At least Hillary sounds like a real candidate. Trump sounds like a side show act. No way I can vote for him. I also try and not vote for who the KKK,Nazi's,and Russia are endorsing.

10 | John Barron | 13 | 1145303848887382_1145370568880710 | I'm hearing North Carolina is the state to watch and that Hillary may have a problem with African American voters there who are polling more towards Trump.I pray she can hold that lead or broaden it. These polls are stressing me out because i just saw one earlier saying Trump was leading on Electoral College votes. (It wasnt Fox News)Im just trying to think good thoughts and be able to accept whatever the country decides versus getting sick to my stomach.I voted and thats all i can do at this point.
11 | Russell Hindman | 3 | 1145303848887382_717226551776226 | MSNBC is so obviously attacking Trump. Foolish and certifiably biased. One more reason that network broadcast corporations are going down, they have decided to be biased and attack anything against the Clinton machine. Brian Williams is more truthful than Hillary.
12 | John Younkin | 5 | 1145303848887382_717026605129554 | The two most glaring points raised by Assange are as follows:1.) Trump will ‚Äúnot be permitted to win.‚ÄùIn answer to the question, ‚ÄúIs Wikileaks trying to put Trump in the White House?‚Äù Assange insists that Trump will not be permitted to win.  ‚ÄúBanks, intelligence, arms companies, big foreign money, etc. is all united behind Hillary Clinton‚Ä¶.and the media as well‚Ä¶the owners and the journalists themselves.‚Äù2.) The Clinton Foundation has received significant contributions from some of the same countries that are funding ISIS.  Hillary Clinton was aware of the Saudi funding of ISIS and also accepted money for her foundation from the Saudis.
13 | Paula Benson | 15 | 1145303848887382_1075146499250862 | Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!
14 | Paul Walsh | 20 | 1145303848887382_1145358955548538 | Well guess what Trump haters. Good news for ya. The case was dropped by the woman Claiming he raped her when she was 13. SHE DROPPED IT! WONDER WHY. MAYBE CAUSE IT WAS FALSE!  So there you have it folks. Next!!!
15 | Annette Kessee | 4 | 1145303848887382_717014618464086 | Trump should have never disrespected the Bush's during the primaries. They have lots of friends on both sides of the isle with BIG money, and power.Where is Karl Rove and the Koch brothers, who normally supply all those millions to the Republican party's nominee.......crickets. They will make sure he doesn't get near the Whitehouse. Oh yeah, and who's out there stomping for Trump on the campaign trail other than his VP nominee, Mike Pence.He will never be President of this nation!
16 | Jason Brantley | 12 | 1145303848887382_1145364632214637 | Hillary Clinton will eventually be indicted which would cause our country to come to a grinding halt. There is no stopping that now. The Constitutional controversy would mire this country in Hillary's problems for years, at the expense of the things that really matter in America.
17 | Jeff Uzor | 18 | 1145303848887382_717041918461356 | Donald Trump is a clueless, con man. He will disgrace America with his errant tweets. His temperament is so horrible, morally he is bankrupt. I will vote for Hillary though am not a democrat.
18 | Russell Hindman | 2 | 1145303848887382_1075357739229738 | I have no affection for Saul Alinsky.  He can pledge affection to Lucifer and Mrs. Clinton can show lifelong affection for the rules for radicals. Even lifelong Democrats must ask, do you want to vote for someone who will definitively be enriched for serious crimes after this election regardless of the results of the election? Don't do it. Trump for real change. here is what Hillary Embraces....Saul Alinsky‚Äôs 12 Rules for RadicalsHere is the complete list from Alinsky.* RULE 1: ‚ÄúPower is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.‚Äù Power is derived from 2 main sources ‚Äì money and people. ‚ÄúHave-Nots‚Äù must build power from flesh and blood. (These are two things of which there is a plentiful supply. Government and corporations always have a difficult time appealing to people, and usually do so almost exclusively with economic arguments.)* RULE 2: ‚ÄúNever go outside the expertise of your people.‚Äù It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone. (Organizations under attack wonder why radicals don‚Äôt address the ‚Äúreal‚Äù issues. This is why. They avoid things with which they have no knowledge.)* RULE 3: ‚ÄúWhenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.‚Äù Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. (This happens all the time. Watch how many organizations under attack are blind-sided by seemingly irrelevant arguments that they are then forced to address.)* RULE 4: ‚ÄúMake the enemy live up to its own book of rules.‚Äù If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules. (This is a serious rule. The besieged entity‚Äôs very credibility and reputation is at stake, because if activists catch it lying or not living up to its commitments, they can continue to chip away at the damage.)* RULE 5: ‚ÄúRidicule is man‚Äôs most potent weapon.‚Äù There is no defense. It‚Äôs irrational. It‚Äôs infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions. (Pretty crude, rude and mean, huh? They want to create anger and fear.)* RULE 6: ‚ÄúA good tactic is one your people enjoy.‚Äù They‚Äôll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They‚Äôre doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones. (Radical activists, in this sense, are no different that any other human being. We all avoid ‚Äúun-fun‚Äù activities, and but we revel at and enjoy the ones that work and bring results.)* RULE 7: ‚ÄúA tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.‚Äù Don‚Äôt become old news. (Even radical activists get bored. So to keep them excited and involved, organizers are constantly coming up with new tactics.)* RULE 8: ‚ÄúKeep the pressure on. Never let up.‚Äù Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new. (Attack, attack, attack from all sides, never giving the reeling organization a chance to rest, regroup, recover and re-strategize.)* RULE 9: ‚ÄúThe threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.‚Äù Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist. (Perception is reality. Large organizations always prepare a worst-case scenario, something that may be furthest from the activists‚Äô minds. The upshot is that the organization will expend enormous time and energy, creating in its own collective mind the direst of conclusions. The possibilities can easily poison the mind and result in demoralization.)* RULE 10: ‚ÄúIf you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.‚Äù Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog. (Unions used this tactic. Peaceful [albeit loud] demonstrations during the heyday of unions in the early to mid-20th Century incurred management‚Äôs wrath, often in the form of violence that eventually brought public sympathy to their side.)* RULE 11: ‚ÄúThe price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.‚Äù Never let the enemy score points because you‚Äôre caught without a solution to the problem. (Old saw: If you‚Äôre not part of the solution, you‚Äôre part of the problem. Activist organizations have an agenda, and their strategy is to hold a place at the table, to be given a forum to wield their power. So, they have to have a compromise solution.)* RULE 12: Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.‚Äù Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions. (This is cruel, but very effective. Direct, personalized criticism and ridicule works.)Be Sociable, Share!

21 | Sheila Frobuccino | 8 | 1145303848887382_1145389418878825 | Think the attempted smear campaign for Hillary, may have backfired...just made her stronger and the Trump promoters dirty work more obvious.
22 | Pat Lawrence-Caldwell | 3 | 1145303848887382_717171515115063 | No matter what anyone says or proves you obviously are going to believe trump. They tells me a couple of things: one, facts and evidence are things you are unfamiliar with and two, you obviously like jackboots, stiff armed salutes and all the nasty, ugly crap that goes with it. Trump is indefensible yet here you are.

24 | John Lewis | 0 | 1145303848887382_717598538405694 | What Birther Trump, Giuliani, James Comey and the rogue FBI agents perpetrated against Secretary Clinton was a bridge too far... Their cynical, insidious, nefarious actions are beyond the limits of proper political discourse... The voters view the attack upon Secretary Clinton as being over the top and unfair and they're responding by saying i'm with her...
25 | Chanel Borowski | 6 | 1145303848887382_1145369328880834 | We really shouldn't be considering national polls that are within the margin of error this close to Election Day. Not too many ppl are still undecided. Just vote and let the chips fall where they may. I'm over it. This election season has been the worst.

He can't win alone just by the white votes. It is very frightening to see someone who openly discuss and talked about people of color in a very demeaning, racist way in this country. This country is better than that and we can't elect this man to be our next president.

2 | Soji Adelabu | 115 | 725912724240422_725924027572625 | If any other republican is on the ballot(at least to have a change) I would have love to support him or her , but having a woman groper, a bigot ,a racist, person who said he has never asked for forgiveness from God for anything...person who cheated small business owner,avoided paying tax,somebody who loves to make money when others are crying,who doesn't respect women, boasted he can shoot somebody and still win an election,..mocked disable person...I don't think such a person is even qualify to be a school principal..
3 | Scott Bill Fleschute | 103 | 725912724240422_725925634239131 | Even more reasons to vote for Trump. The Affordable Care Act is not affordable for the middle class even before the rates started skyrocketing and who can afford a $5000 deductible? Yes, we need national healthcare but what we have is hurting middle class Americans. The trade agreements are unfair and hurting Americans. Hillary could have made a difference but didn't take that route.
4 | Britton Collie Wendel | 67 | 725912724240422_725924097572618 | Hey So now that the FBI has informed you that they have Hillary's deleted emails as of 8 EST, are you going to continue campaigning on her behalf?
5 | Patti Grothe | 35 | 725912724240422_725924854239209 | Morrison Eileen Matuza) I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste from a fellow deplorable Trumpian

Oh and let's not forget about the possibility that she might get put behind bars for all that she has done. Oh but she can't because she's just above the law for that. But let's just say if it was you or your children you would be behind bars before you could say please. Vote for Hilary Clinton if you don't care where this country goes. Vote for Trump if you want to cleanse Washington DC of corruption.
12 | Jered Olds | 17 | 725912724240422_725928244238870 | That's why I'm voting Trump! Because four more years of your policies by crooked, lying and criminal Hillary will hurt this country if not ruin it!

17 | Randy Altstock | 9 | 725912724240422_725926144239080 | Poor president Obama doesn't understand that the reason he could be elected president is because we want to change all of the Obama ideology and failed policies.

Honestly, we're freaked out by all the insane rhetoric, and complete denial of facts, from the republican party's Voldemort and his death eaters. We're fighting to move forward together, not backward divided. Thank you for everything you've fought for on our behalf.
20 | Marianna Arvay | 5 | 725912724240422_1087417328038145 | President Obama has been a great president and a great example of how a president should comport himself and how he should present himself to the country and the world. Although he hasn't been able to accomplish everything he and we would have liked, due to the obstructionism of a bigoted, ignorant, misogynistic and just plain jealous GOP determined to undermine everything he tried to do, he has still managed to take forward steps in providing health insurance to many who couldn't afford it or have access to it previously, to work with other nations to put climate protections into a treaty that proved that all of us on this planet can work together to protect our environment, to forge a treaty with Iran that benefits both nations and all the other nations in the region and to secure the right of every American to marry the person of their choice. In addition, he has pulled us out of the greatest threat to our financial security since the Great Depression, a parting gift from the Republican administration and practices of Bush and Chaney. Mrs. Obama has been an active, admirable and exemplary First Lady and his two lovely girls have grown up to young womanhood, with his oldest scheduled for Harvard University. Anyone who does not admire this president, his success and legacy, as well as his and his family's image is a sad excuse for a human being.
21 | Joe DeMeo | 3 | 725912724240422_1087236444722900 | Imagine if OBAMA fixed our roads and bridges - concentrated in honoring our veterans instead of trying to change the world to HIS liking- took care of America proper - got rid of the elite politicians with term limits. Made it so a black man, Asian man, Latino man and  a white man could walk unfettered through each other's neighborhoods . Without transgression , in peace . Imagine .......
22 | Michael Elizabeth Ferguson | 2 | 725912724240422_1087697158010162 | So the great Obama, winner of the 2009 Nobel Peace Participation Trophy was, in his own mind, elected to ‚Äúend wars.‚Äù Mr. President, there are two ways to end a combat engagement: you win or you lose. Telling everyone you‚Äôre quitting may sound admirable to the likes of progressive socialists such as yourself ‚Äî but, in essence, it‚Äôs deemed as cowardice. When you walk away from the battlefield with an enemy still occupying ground, you lost. And when you try to reinsert our troops into the same combat environment with nebulous guidance and objectives, combined with dangerous and insidious rules of engagement, you make our men and women targets, not Warriors.Here is ‚Äî tragically so ‚Äî another example of the failure of one Barack Obama, who‚Äôs running around the Country, on the taxpayer dime, ranting about electing the most corrupt, criminal and deceitful presidential candidate this Nation has ever seen. And coming on the heels of Obama, that‚Äôs saying a lot. See, Barack Obama is not back in the White House tending to the issues facing this Nation‚Ä¶you know, anemic job and economic growth, rising jobless claims, rising healthcare insurance premiums, and a conundrum of foreign failures ‚Äî mainly centered on the Middle East and abject resurgence of Islamic terrorism. Instead of Obama shouting at young voters in Florida about reality TV shows and begging them to vote, he should be focused on securing a better future for them. Not the case.
23 | Joe Elliott | 1 | 725912724240422_725970787567949 | Everyone must go vote for Hillary Clinton our next President of the United States of America under God and Tim Kaine the next Vice President of the United States of America under God and the down ballot absentee, early or on November 8, but Go vote! ( Not on Nov 28 ) Go Hillary Clinton
24 | Daffodil Cee | 0 | 725912724240422_1087994154647129 | When Pres. Obama took office, the Dow Jones collapsed to 7,000, but just recently it's almost all the way up to 19,000. When he took office, America's Auto Industry was on the verge of disappearing from the map, but under the leadership of Pres. Obama, it is thriving and doing very well. If only the President can run for a third term, we, Obama voters, would gladly vote for him again with the same enthusiasm against any Republican candidate for POTUS.
25 | Manuel Vargas | 1 | 725912724240422_1087245018055376 | Harold Church, Trump's morals, mocking the disabled, demeaning war heroes and woman, creating fortune by defrauding people, taking small businesses to bankruptcy by refusing to pay he's obligations etc, etc. Some morals.

What did Giuliani know from the FBI? http://on.msnbc.com/2foceQM
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Margaret Mary Donaldson | 697 | 1342248942538021_1342252442537671 | Sleazebag knew exactly what was going to happen because the Trump campaign set it up. And your Orange leader has the audacity to talk about rigged elections?  Too bad you're still going to LOSE
2 | Brian Bessinger | 533 | 1342248942538021_1342254262537489 | Giuliani suffers from the worst case of paranoid delusional schizophrenic dementia I've ever seen. Put him in a home, give him a toy microphone, and let him talk to himself for the rest of his sad days.
3 | Elaine Abbott Montalbano | 172 | 1342248942538021_1342258635870385 | He new he helped set it up. He needs to be charged and disbarred. I bet the FBI trump lovers planted those emails on Wieners computer because they had it for over a month. FBI lost all credibility and Comey needs to be replaced along with all agents involved. They are attacking our elections and democracy ‚ÄºÔ∏è
4 | Sandra Benson | 143 | 1342248942538021_1342258852537030 | Giuliani is pathetic! Sitting there lying thru his fake add teeth when the recording of him bragging about that he knew some #BreitbartBullShit was about to hit the fan a few days ago. Giuliani is a joke!
5 | Gregory Epler | 149 | 1342248942538021_1342259945870254 | Here is a fun fact: Turns out FBI Director Comey's former boss is none other than Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump's #1 surrogate and adviser. At least we now have a good idea on why Comey politicized the FBI by trying to smear Clinton at the 11th hour . . .
6 | Theresa Lynn Sapp | 103 | 1342248942538021_1342259462536969 | Great show on Hardball tonight. Chris Mathews didn't let him roll over him, mostly, because Giuliani started ranting like a mad man and avoiding questions, but Chris stuck in there! Good job!
7 | Kristin Rainey Lee | 114 | 1342248942538021_1342250085871240 | And there you go. Assuming the corruption  is only on the Democrat side is ridiculous.
8 | Nancy Olavarria | 80 | 1342248942538021_1342279935868255 | He was smiling while being questioned by Chris Matthew and denying involvement yet on the news article he was bragging about it. What lowlife this jerk is!! He should be in jail with his cronies!!üò°üò°üëé
9 | Maria Teresa Estrella | 55 | 1342248942538021_1342302695865979 | I'm so tired of Giuliani and all Trump's team, they are a bunch of liars, racists and corrupt politicians. Lying to people to confuse them and the worst is they know exactly what they are doing and the possible consequences. Can not wait until November 8th to shown them who we really are, we would proved them wrong and elected our First Female President of USA
10 | Fay Marus | 43 | 1342248942538021_1342257882537127 | Donald Trump has a preliminary hearing on 12/16/2016 at 10 am in front of judge Ronnie Abrams at Manhattan federal court house the second time he's been charged with rape this time against a 13year old child.Child Rape...Case 1:16-CV-04642 US District Court Southern District of New York.
11 | Cal Wentworth | 38 | 1342248942538021_1342258382537077 | You cant tell me that he didn't know that the Fbi was going to release a document. By the expression and excitement that you could see in his face. It was not about commercials coming up. I hope karma gets this guy and another one that needs karma is Chris Christie and how he hung his aides out to go to prison just awful.
12 | Joel Chandler Parks | 25 | 1342248942538021_1342256092537306 | Hey Rudi !...I was on uber- taxi- ride today ,.. and two former oncologist doctors got on the ride with me , in Washington D.C.,.. they we talking,.. an they said, '' he - '' think's - his prostate cancer is under control, but that it is really Metastasized to the bladder and pelvis,.. and very soon he will be very ill because he thinks he is well, and his treatment did not cure the cancer ,.. I was so concerned , that I asked them..?  were they going to call him and give him their opinions ..??? -  they said no,.!! . because he had stated,.. that when he had committed adultery ,..his priest forgave him.. and the priest could take care of the advanced cancer because the- source - was the same as the adultery !.. what a shame... !
13 | Jonathan A. Washington | 15 | 1342248942538021_1634139846885419 | He the former boss of Comey and now Racist Rudy is cashing in on favors that is owed to him. It is a pattern with Republicans that the media has not caught up to. Whenever they make a big deal about something being illegal, rigged, or crooked. They are doing that same thing themselves. Trump called Mexicans rapist, and he is a sexual predator and one himself. Trump talks about rigged elections and his friend Stone just got served by the court to stop illegally trying to suppress the Black vote. He talks about Crooked Hillary, but he is in trouble for fraud. His good friend Christie is responsible for the bridge closures. There is no way he did not know about especially since his people were just found guilty.  The FBI has been called Trump land and for some reason no one seems to care. That is alright, but they are worried about emails.
14 | Ken McCafferty | 22 | 1342248942538021_1342288179200764 | What the loud mouth of Giulliani did was provide an excellent opportunity for the Democrats by exposing alt-right conspiracy within the FBI and FBIAA - now people need to be informed and start putting the pieces together... by Monday night.
15 | Tom Ferguson | 30 | 1342248942538021_1342271402535775 | Because Giuliani is a puppet of the Brietbart Conspiracy Movement. I fear the FBI and Mr, Comey are also their puppets. VOTE BLUE ALL THE WAY DOWN THE ELECTION BALLOT!
16 | Charles James | 22 | 1342248942538021_1342279615868287 | They have been calling for jail based on a rogue email server, which is ridiculous revisionism given Shrubs 22 million deleted emails.  Guiliani and the New York FBI are criminals and need to go to jail.
17 | Dandymarch Hcramydnad | 16 | 1342248942538021_1342288889200693 | He was pretty happy telling about a big surprise. Now, when his beak was caught naughty, he denied about knowing. Any more clown in town? Or maybe struck by amnesia? come-on Giuliboy !
18 | Adem Tumbo | 33 | 1342248942538021_1342252235871025 | You believe that none is perfect except God The Almighty. You believe that you are the change that America needs. Go and vote for Hillary. You believe in love. Vote for Hillary Clinton. You believe in tolerance. You believe in sobriety. Vote for Hillary Clinton. You believe in Progress. You believe in a stronger American economy. You believe in harmony, peace and better security in your neighborhood. Then vote for Hillary Clinton. You believe that together, we are one, our political diversity is our strength. Vote for Hillary Clinton. You believe in forgiveness of sins. You believe that America is the greatest country in the planet Earth. Then vote for Hillary Clinton. You believe that everyone in this country can work harder to make America even better. You believe that Americans and American President must be accepted by the all countries in the Face of The Planet. Then vote for Hillary Clinton. But if you believe that one person can finish America problems, vote for Trump. You believe that Trump is god, then vote for Trump. You believe in hatred, racism, use of vullger language, vote for Trump. You believe in hatred, religious classifications, vote for Trump. You believe in wars, fighting and blood shed, vote for Trump. You believe in recklessness, vote for Trump. You believe in great plans that cannot be substantiated, then vote for Trump. You believe in rejection, mocking of fellow Americans, vote for Trump. If you are a clueless person, miss informed and has no inch of God given wisdom, vote for Trump. A vote for Trump has serious consequences. The whole world except Russia will reject America and Americans. America will be split right in the middle; moderates on the one side and radical deplorables on the other. Trump presidency will make America worst than Somalia. With Trump as President, America might experience the worst ever civil war in our generation. Only Jesus can win any war against Satan. Trump is The Anti Christ. Satan will prevail over America if Trump becomes your President. Trump does not even believe in God. He cannot even recite one single verse from the Holy Bible. America of all the countries in the Earth surface want to elect Lucifer's representative as President. Trump praises Putin, Lt Gaddafi, Lt Sadam Hussein. Trump will soon tell the world that Osama Bin Laden was his hero. If you vote Trump, America is headed to the worst ever direction, pit of hell. Use your vote, let God's wisdom prevail upon you. Allow God to direct your inner soul by the power of The Holy Spirit. The light in Trump is not God's light. It's Lucifer's light. Go out and vote Hillary Clinton The Queen. Go out and vote now. Trump deplorables are planning to bring chaos and turmoil in America on 8th of November. Go and vote now. Don't wait for Tuesday. Go and vote now. Vote Hillary Clinton. God bless America. The whole world is watching you. You can prevent this dangerous disaster of Trump becoming POTUS. You have the power. Go and vote for Hillary now. Go Hillary. Go Hillary. VOTE BLUE.
19 | Bette Fritz | 14 | 1342248942538021_1342296999199882 | Comey is afraid of the Repubs in Congress. They raked him over the coals pretty good. He can probably start packing up his desk. He's lost all control and respect.
20 | Jamia Reese | 3 | 1342248942538021_1181672395211616 | I don't think it's right that he new what was going to happen. In my personal opinion I feel like who ever told him what was about to happen needs to be in trouble. Seems like people are doing a bunch of favors for people to take control of this whole situation. It's a sad day when people can't take a lost and accept IT!!!
21 | Malo Azizi | 21 | 1342248942538021_1342274812535434 | Giuliani , JAIL him pathetic old bald evil & deplorable üíØ üêñ üêñ Trump is disgrace to America.üí©Clueless, No dignity or morals= Trump campaign. üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªBigot,Lyin,Desperate, we have all heard Trump narcissist, misogyny, white suptremist, thin skinned reactions to bully anyone in his way. A slew of law suits for fraud at Trump Universaty, many bankruptcies ( just take the money & run) , failed marriages, draft dodger. No experience, no plan. Just "believe me", I know more than the military Generals. Trump products all made out of the USA. Don't forget the conspiracy behind everything. Can't wait till this fool disappears into the hole he crawled out of.#NEVERTRUMP
22 | Robert L. Mckenzie | 16 | 1342248942538021_1342280835868165 | See I knew this was a set up and the good news is thank God a lot of folks had voted already!! Trump campaign should be ashamed of themselves trying to win this election in such a nasty dirty way !! why because they have no issues to run on!!!
23 | Jennifer Davis | 9 | 1342248942538021_1181369081908614 | Look at him! Looking like he just committed the biggest presidential campaign sabatoge in history! I can't wait for the election results to come in next Tuesday night so that evil smug can be wiped right off that UGLY FACE when it's announcef Hillary Clinton, the first female, as the next president!!
24 | Nick Previsich | 10 | 1342248942538021_1342284455867803 | After the election I hope that there are NUMEROUS indictments for conspiracy to commit election fraud and colluding with a foreign power to interfere with the lawful governance of the United States, and that Skeletor here is hauled in with the Trump campaign & a good-sized fraction of the FBI.This cannot be allowed to pass unaddressed in the strongest possible legal way.
25 | Cynthia Comer | 9 | 1342248942538021_1634133046886099 | Hackers have already alerted the FBI about Trump's ties to Russia. They have leaked that Trump has been working with the Russians for at least 5 years. Trump lied and said he didn't know anything about Putin, just like he lied about knowing David Duke.

1 | Marcia Freeman | 694 | 1342226259206956_1342235512539364 | I am not even American but somehow the message has to get through that that imbecile who is a despicable man by the name of Trump cannot be allowed to become president of the USA.... please go out and vote for Hilary, you do not want that man running your country!! He is a total joke and an embarrassment to the people of the USA.
2 | Cory Predmore | 643 | 1342226259206956_1342229352539980 | BREAKING NEWS! Clinton is now leading in the polls in key battleground states such as Qatar, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Syria and hopefully soon San Quentin!
3 | Showie A. Ford | 132 | 1342226259206956_1342257629203819 | Why do people listen to actors/ musician for life advice? They are not famous for their brains. They're famous for their pretty faces and fancy talents we like to watch. Come on. I don't care what kind of food Pharrell feeds his dog, and I dont care who he is voting for.
4 | Krystal Perez | 145 | 1342226259206956_1342240519205530 | I've never put much attention to Pharrell, but as he spoke, I was getting chills. Because, that shows all the support she has. She has support from people who are known across the world. Literally. I'm amazed. I'm excited to see the sore loser's face go blank. I have to admit, I am afraid. We have to think positively, though. We cannot let a racist, sexist, pathetic, trash-talking, inhumane Republican be the face and voice of our country.
5 | Constance A Marshall | 68 | 1342226259206956_1342235489206033 | I'm praying that not a single person eligible to vote sits on the sidelines as this election is a fight for America as we know it! There's only one lady qualified enough to be Madam President & it ain't Jill Stein, no offense just the truth!
6 | Pam Petersen Dillow | 53 | 1342226259206956_1342257879203794 | I don't want Hillary Clinton to win the presidency just because she is a woman.  I want her to win because she was the best person for the job. I know she gets elected it will be a historical event, but I wish people would focus on the bigger picture here.
7 | Richard Kelly | 64 | 1342226259206956_1342236382539277 | This comment page is a microcosm of this whole election. The Trump deplorables spreading their hatred to every corner of the country and thinking it patriotic and even worse morally correct. I ban everyone of them.

Wake up people !!!!! If Killary is president things are going to get worse and worse and worse. Taxes healthcare, interest rates are going to keep going up and up!!!  Killary IS NOT FOR THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE!!!!
12 | Missy Stephens | 20 | 1342226259206956_1342287069200875 | So Trump can be our role model?! Seriously? The way he treats women, Latinos, African-Americans, LGBTQ people... basically anyone that is different than him, he thinks they are beneath him. I would have considered voting for ANY of the other Republican candidates, but I cannot in good conscience even entertain the thought of voting for Trump. He will destroy our country. He will alienate us from our allies around the world. The idea of a President Trump scares me to my core.

There was no need for your to be nervous, that's for certain !
15 | Sean Thompson | 6 | 1342226259206956_1371698219549410 | Thank God. I wasn't sure what to do until Pharrell  told me. Being one of the common folk I couldn't possibly read for myself. Thankfully all these kind celebrity actors and musicians are here to tell us what to do.

18 | Feliciano Ramos | 11 | 1342226259206956_1342286822534233 | He's not only a joke but he has become the world jester an embarrassment to this great country. Just imagine, would you want a president that has been accused by numerous females of alleged sexual assaults and of the rape of a 13 year old child? If the allegations are true this wannabe needs to be held accountable for all of his atrocities against females and other immoral crimes that has recently shock the public conscious!
19 | Pam Jones Beaty | 9 | 1342226259206956_1143063359121405 | I can't believe you m, Pharrell Williams, support a woman who supports the murder and slaughter of babies 9 months in the womb and who sold her country out to other countries for personal gain and is getting away with it. I will never watch another show that has you on it or listen to one of your songs ever again.
20 | Heather Lex | 9 | 1342226259206956_1342267519202830 | Oh, but it's okay that Trump is a sexual predator who is going to trial for RAPING A 13 YR OLD?!! Not to mention that he's cheated on his wives. What is wrong with you?

If Hillary by some chance is indicted and charged or even  impeached, the party of " blue " is still in power. No time to back up. Time to push for unity through togetherness !

24 | Marguerite Nelson | 1 | 1342226259206956_1778719855731019 | After Hillary Clinton lost the primary to Barack Obama in 2008 she then went out and campaigned for him and helped him get elected. She helped the african american community break the glass ceiling, and put a black man in the white house. Now it's time for the african american community to return the favor and help a woman break the glass ceiling and put the first woman in the white house. She can not do it without them.

1 | Bernadette Carmen | 1412 | 1342189639210618_1342194205876828 | And there's the difference right there between a gracious and tolerant human being when faced with someone with a differing opinion and Trump who screams for hecklers to be dragged out to the delight of his deplorables!
2 | Dustin Welker | 985 | 1342189639210618_1342192412543674 | Now that is how you act presidential. Not to say "Get him the hell outta here." Like a certain someone....
3 | Liv Smith | 475 | 1342189639210618_1342196112543304 | He didn't "snap" at them by any stretch of the imagination, but yeah. Whilst I certainly don't agree with *everything* that he's done in the past eight years, the vast majority of the time I'm proud as hell to call this man my President. Obama for a 3rd term. (Y)
4 | Patricia Davey | 461 | 1342189639210618_1342204252542490 | We won't see the likes of this great man again. He could have accomplished so much more if he didn't have a republican congress blocking him every step of the way. He still managed to turn us around from the brink of disaster.
5 | Nic Delgado | 359 | 1342189639210618_1342196989209883 | He has always been about class as is his wife who is one of my heroes and their daughters! Yet they get no credit with a lot of America because they are black! So sad! Best President and first Family in a long time!!!!!!!
6 | Sequin Frederick | 195 | 1342189639210618_1342203062542609 | That's how you take a negative situation and turn it into positive. It's logic and moves like this that has stopped wars and showed people how to respect each other. Go Obama!!! Teaching human decency one say at a time!! Can we keep him??
7 | Judith Brownstein | 216 | 1342189639210618_1342192342543681 | The ignorant Repubs are out in full force tonight.  Didn't know so many right wing women thought rape was sooooo okay when Trump does it.
8 | Diane Lacy | 156 | 1342189639210618_1342219859207596 | I listened to President Obama live today. The best speaker in the country! He handeled the heckler perfectly. Unlike Tump who encourages violence at his rallies. We know winners and losers when we hear them. Trump you are no Obama, not even close, not even for a second!
9 | Marcia Freeman | 169 | 1342189639210618_1342214262541489 | I am not even American but somehow the message has to get through that that imbecile who is a despicable man by the name of Trump cannot be allowed to become president of the USA.... please go out and vote for Hilary, you do not want that man running your country!! He is a total joke and an embarrassment to the people of the USA.
10 | John Blankenship | 115 | 1342189639210618_1342226079206974 | I'm so sad he's going away. And I'm not being dramatic. His grace, his families' grace, putting up with undeserved hate for 8 yrs years..... They deserve a standing 0. So sickened and disgusted by 1/2 of this country. A bunch of unintelligent boobs. Back to Obama.. If I could break bread with anyone it would be him. The most powerful yet humble man. If everything happens as it should.... We may just see him on the Supreme Court?! Please....

12 | Kollin Woodard | 63 | 1342189639210618_1342209019208680 | I've said it before and I'll say it again, Republicans have absolutely no lives, especially if they spend a majority of their time on a liberal FB page trying to argue Democrats down about their candidate. It also speaks volumes about their moral fiber when they call another candidate corrupt while accepting and trying to explain away their candidates flaws. I know my candidate is flawed, but I can live with her flaws, not his or his hateful, islamaphobic, anti Hispanic immigrant,  rhetoric.
13 | Carol Davis | 74 | 1342189639210618_1342207489208833 | Obama told the CROWD to hold on, sit down and be quiet because the protestor has a democratic right to his opinion and, since he appeared to be elderly and perhaps a vet, deserved their respect.
14 | Dale Whiting | 44 | 1342189639210618_1342229985873250 | Classy! Trump would have called for his followers to throw them out and offered to pay any fines and attorney's fees associated with this misbehavior. Obama the responsible adult. Trump the irresponsible spoiled brat.
15 | Saibatu Kamara | 29 | 1342189639210618_1342246845871564 | And how did 72yrs old Trump responded to a similar situation "kick him outside and get the hell out of him guys . I will pay for any lawsuits". Is that a leader?
16 | Holly Johnston Holland | 17 | 1342189639210618_1238588162851068 | Obama represents pure class!! I think people tend to be oblivious as to how good we have it. He will be missed as the leader of the free world!!! Don't allow Trump to erase everything he has done! Vote SMART, vote for the continuation of progression, vote for our climate! Vote Clinton!
17 | Justin Matthews | 12 | 1342189639210618_1342218739207708 | Hahaha. So telling people who are excersing their free speech to hold up. Sounds more like a dictator. Trump will win and you liberals will have no place to hide.
18 | Mark Rush | 16 | 1342189639210618_1342229639206618 | This is how a President handles a problem. Not telling his supporters to commit some sort of violent act. Listen up Donald " The Crook " Trump and take notes.
19 | Marisa A. Agostino | 13 | 1342189639210618_1342206769208905 | Mary,you know why shootings? Ever since Donald Trump started campaigning he promoted violence!! It's not President Obama's fault ...he is doing the best.he doesn't tell people to shoot police . All this has been happening since dump trump came out!!!
20 | Shirley Rhodes | 18 | 1342189639210618_1342218482541067 | Hold Up,Hold up, Hold up!! This is what a Real President who respects the Freedom of Speech does... Not necessary to insult a protestor or yell kick him out or call him names..
21 | Curtis Coshun | 7 | 1342189639210618_1342260312536884 | I'm a deplorable, but can't say he's wrong. Trump will win with our voices via our votes. Then watch the animals riot cause killary lost. The only problem I have is his English. Save your ghetto slang for the ghetto. "HOLD UP, HOLD UP".. that is definitely not how a public speaker, let alone a president should be addressing anyone.
22 | Kelvin Badloo | 1 | 1342189639210618_1638101373153811 | People of the U.S. I want you to know...this election is so important that if every citizen of every other country in the world could have voted in your election for Hillary Clinton they would do so...but as fate will have it, only U.S. citizens can vote so the world needs you to vote for her please...just stop trump and the evil that he represents
23 | Yahya Bajinka | 3 | 1342189639210618_1238916306151587 | Guess Donald J Trump watched a different tape after he told his crowd of supporters that President Obama screamed at the protester. I bet you Donald Trump never seize to amaze the world. He would tell his supporters to punch the poor senior in the face and he will pay for the attorney. Dude lie about everything on earth!!!!
24 | Ed Lewton | 5 | 1342189639210618_1342195115876737 | So is MSNBC going to drop the ball over the weekend at this most critical juncture of America and do prison crap or are they going to stay in the game because if they dont i will lose all respect for this General Electric subsidiary
25 | Cynthia Comer | 5 | 1342189639210618_1238696389506912 | The difference between Class and Trash is shown how President Obama allows Trump hecklers to stay, while Trump tells his goons to throw hecklers out or it's OK to physically assault them.

1 | Jerry Landry | 46 | 1342184092544506_1342190542543861 | Obama knows, most America knows if Hilary loses, the Clinton's obamas and alot of their buds go to Gitmo.Seven years of C-SPAN testimony with wikileaks has produced more impeachable crimes than I can count.
2 | Angela Shannon | 19 | 1342184092544506_1342288472534068 | It was the democrats that wanted to keep and spread slavery, the democrats that actually started the kkk, the democrats that took away the 40 acres + mule Republican Pres. Lincoln  gave, the democrats that enacted Jim Crow, the democrats that fought against equal rights. Look it up people, look at the voting records! They are lying to you and using you!
3 | Cynthia Comer | 0 | 1342184092544506_1342440299185552 | Hackers have already informed the FBI about Trump's ties to Russia going back 5 years or more. Trump lied about knowing anything about Putin. He lied about not knowing David Duke. Trump zombies have been lied to from Day 1, and they will be sadly defeated when their Orange God loses the election.
4 | Marion Rohling | 0 | 1342184092544506_1342709789158603 | We can split hairs all we want, we can go through this with a fine tooth comb & what are we left with? TWO sides! I know what I lived during President Obama's administration & what it was like for me & mine during the Bush administration...I also very well recall the Bill Clinton era! The FBI was never THIS openly politically motivated to bring a candidate down!
5 | Patricia L. McMann | 9 | 1342184092544506_1342190269210555 | The add Trumps champaign has out that says Hillary is under investigation is false, and could be and is being used for SLANDER!!! This add needs pulled for being corrupt.  Fox news spread it and had to WALK IT BACK! so should this add be removed!
6 | Carlos DeCarvalho | 3 | 1342184092544506_1342346199194962 | I am glad we had a African American president! Long over due! But man, Obama stop blemishing  your image by lying for Hillary or even supporting such a corrupt woman that you fired! You proved she was a failure?
7 | Carlos DeCarvalho | 6 | 1342184092544506_1342320659197516 | How can Obama continue to spend taxpayer money parading like a puppet for Hillary? Why are taxpayers paying for this clown to parade around at our expense? This is what's wrong with the Democratic Party!
8 | Shawn Moore | 1 | 1342184092544506_1342676099161972 | Barack Obama is a self-realized man knowing ‚Äî in body, mind, and soul - that he is one with the omnipresence of God and that he does not have to pray that it come to him.If it is stated by Barack Obama then it is truth. So it doesn‚Äôt matter if Obama propaganda isn‚Äôt in accordance with fact or reality, he is Barack Obama. "I think if you are talking about the specific virulence of some of the opposition directed towards me, then, you know, that may be explained by the particulars of who I am.‚Äù ‚Äî Barack ObamaIn a campaign speech intended to help the campaign of Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama mentioned himself 207 times. This is routine for him. It's all about him.The fault is with an ignorant ‚Äúthem‚Äù and their biases not Obama‚Äôs own unimpressive record of governance. Who are you to question him? The Most Destructive American President in Our History.
9 | Kris Zig | 7 | 1342184092544506_1342201022542813 | Hillary is saying to the FBI GO AHEAD look all you want. That's what criminals say to the law when the law says we are going to search knowing that they HIDING something that they should not have and hoping the law does not find it. and when it's found the criminals says that's not mine. I don't recall. like Hillary told the FBI 39 TIMES.
10 | Chris Peckham | 2 | 1342184092544506_1342637375832511 | I was asked today how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 11 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... And, add her sexual twisted, demented husband into the factor, there's NO WAY I would ever vote for them two to run MY Country!!!Rant over... Still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste from a fellow deplorable Trumpian.üá∫üá∏
11 | Mike DiBiase | 3 | 1342184092544506_1342221465874102 | If that was the case then she should of gone with charges they had plenty, Now they have more. My concern is why this info was not known to the FBI prior or was it. You can deny all you want all this will come out sooner or later and justice will be served. All the left will turn on them. I can hear it now " We can't believe this was going on " and act shocked.
12 | Eric Forrest | 0 | 1342184092544506_1342563929173189 | Its was a set up by republicans but it didn't work now only they put themselves out their when this over there will be investigation everywhere trump campaign have been a smear on America he hurt this country and benefiting from it too his cable company will keep him rich with his followers

14 | Stoney Williamson | 8 | 1342184092544506_1342195275876721 | Hillary is a criminal, she has surrounded herself with likeminded people in order to continue her lies and deceit. Those who support her share the very same morals and ethics that she displays. She should be sitting in prison and those who assisted her should be sitting in the same cellblock!
15 | Charlene Patton | 0 | 1342184092544506_1342546132508302 | Can't trust them either, They are behind it all ! Get some one from China or Russia to investigate it  !!!! They way we do theirs !
16 | Cristal Brooks | 17 | 1342184092544506_1342185035877745 | So let me get this straight, America is $19 TRILLION in debt and Barack Obama is spending Millions of taxpayers dollars to actively campaigning for a candidate who is now currently twice under a criminal investigation by the FBI.Barack Obama will one day answer to the American people. The scariest part isn't the corrupt cronies but the millions of Americans who don't care and will still vote for Hillary Clinton. And as Obama was Preaching to the African Americans and the Whites, I was disgusted while they almost rioted against a veteran while he was standing there holding his Trump sign.. The left wing just showed how they will treat our VETERANS....

Flynt put up $2 MILLION for anyone who could spill the dirt on Trump (who never claimed to be an angel much less a politician) except for some post menopausal cackling hens, there really isn't anything earth shattering..now on the other side of the aisle stands a CRIMINAL SO CORRUPT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT RICA!! Obama KNOWS her corruption involves him and that's why he's hell bent on stopping the investigations!
19 | Marie Callahan | 0 | 1342184092544506_1342277889201793 | So sad that we can no longer respect or trust the FBI since Comey sent his letter full of innuendo that interfered with and rigged the election.

24 | Christine Novak | 0 | 1342184092544506_1342498629179719 | It appears to be Huma Abedin and Weiner have turned States Witnesses and are currently cooperating with the investigation. Consider this, what if several Congressmen and US Senators took part in having sex with children? What if, they were photographed? What if, they were being extorted as a result? What if, Hillary and Huma were photographed and Weiner didn‚Äôt get purge the pictures because he enjoyed them too much? That has been reported by several insiders within NYPD!
25 | Anthony K. Ruffino | 1 | 1342184092544506_1342248565871392 | This is the best President we will see in our lifetime.  Trump would have to start back in daycare to achieve the class our President has.

Melania Trump‚Äôs first public speech since her infamous RNC appearance was about‚Ä¶ bullying people online.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Karen Howell Colletta | 673 | 1342157392547176_1342165032546412 | Excuse me Mrs. Trump, but have you met your husband?  He is the biggest cyber bully around. You talk about how mean we all are to each other, have you been to one of your husband's rallies?  He preaches hate and mean spirited behavior. You my dear are clearly paid very well to say these lies or you fear that his anger will cause you bodily harm. Talk to his first wife, she'll tell you all about the angry, mean bully that you married. I say take whatever money you can and take your young son and get the hell out of this marriage.
2 | Lynn Oliver | 265 | 1342157392547176_1342168309212751 | Seriously, Melania? Clean your own house before you talk about a mean and rough culture. Your husband is the head of the bullying movement.
3 | Patricia Snyder | 238 | 1342157392547176_1342163752546540 | Isn't she the one who said when he husband talked about sexually assaulting women, it was just "little boy talk".  I don't know who told her to give this little speech, but they didn't do her any better favor than the one who gave her Michelle Obama's speech for the convention. She seems to be an empty headed clothes model.
4 | Joey Trancy | 188 | 1342157392547176_1342158762547039 | Haha coming from the plagiarist x'D whose husband is a sexual predator #ImWithHillary
5 | Gabriel Solis | 147 | 1342157392547176_1342159145880334 | Funny because your husband is the "HUGEst" Cyber-bully that we know of and see weekly...
6 | Karen Carder-Wagner | 111 | 1342157392547176_1342162932546622 | She has fallen and bumped her brainless head! She is just as self absorbed as he is!   She is just as full of it as her orange husband!  Get real she doesn't want to be involved with common people. She is a snob just like the entire Trump family.
7 | Andrew Hensen | 84 | 1342157392547176_1342202855875963 | I make wonderful First Lady and good role model for young American girl. I born in Slovenia. I pose nude in magazine with other woman naked and tell lie about college degree. My husband saw me and say, "I like that, how much". So he buy me. Now I billionaire wife in gold tower. I marry rich and needs or want for nothing. All American woman can relate to me. Yes? I hear tape. Word not from man I marry. I don't know that man. He was egg on. Billy Bush made husband say he touch woman kitten. I have 2 boys...vote for my child husband....and we have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other. I teach youth American values. Kindness, respect, compassion, charity, understanding, cooperation...as long as you are not Mexican, African American, disabled, a POW, overweight, refugee or flat chested. My husband know more about these good values then anyone because he not mean bully, or cyber bully...unless it Twitter...then he insult other man wife for not being model like me.Melania trAmp
8 | Catherine Sippie Adrian | 78 | 1342157392547176_1342187192544196 | The whole family's f****** nuts. How does she have the nerve to stand there with a straight face after her husband is the biggest bully on the internet in existence
9 | Kathy Satterfield Busby | 59 | 1342157392547176_1342187205877528 | Melania Trump's husband is the king of bullies!! If she really means what she says she will be voting for Hillary Clinton next week!!

11 | John H. Alarcon | 63 | 1342157392547176_1342158182547097 | I know it's crazy how some people act so childish on twitter...
12 | Tanji P. Reed Marshall | 38 | 1342157392547176_1342173979212184 | Does she actually realize what she was talking about?  It seems so beyond the pale.  Does she watch TV and see what her husband does?  Does she not realize he's up at 3am tweeting like a crazy man? Where was she during the primaries when he talked about Jeb Bush and his energy?  Where was she when he talked about Little Marco?  It just seems so beyond the pale - almost laughable.
13 | Deborah Harris | 45 | 1342157392547176_1342170259212556 | Her speech writers set her up again. Her first speech was partially plagiarized and now she plans to tackle the very thing that her husband is the king of: bullying! Have a seat Melania!!!! #NevefTrump

15 | Jaimie Hubbard | 35 | 1342157392547176_1342171985879050 | Lmao- Melania trying to lecture the American ppl about cyberbullying and kindness yet her husband is the number #1 bully on and off the internet. How about she start by deleting her husband's twitter account.
16 | Kim Banez | 12 | 1342157392547176_1342210032541912 | The speech she gave wasn't the one she was supposed to give. Wikileaks has released the speech she wanted to give, "Four score and seven years ago, there was one giant leap for mankind. Ask not what you can do for your country, but Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."  While the campaign leadership and Trump wanted her to give the speech, several lower level advisors thought that it may sound too similar to other well known speeches, and due to the previous similarities to Michelle Obama's speech, used a presentation stolen from an anti-cyber bully conference instead.

19 | Kristin Lane | 12 | 1342157392547176_1342179179211664 | I'm sure she knows exactly what she's talking about. Look who she's married to. Can you imagine what this woman's life is like if she ever   steps even an inch out of line?
20 | Andrea Morgan | 18 | 1342157392547176_1342226429206939 | Umm...Melania, dear, you are married to one of the MEANEST, most biased, bigoted, narcissistic, sociopathic, psychopathic, unhinged and unstable, finger-pointing, conspiracy theory-spreading, crooked, FRAUDULENT, lying, mafia/mob affiliated, EVIL soulless inhuman entity, tax return-hiding, despicable, deplorable, obscene, OFFENSIVE, Count Vladcula Pootin (Putin) - loving, INSECURE, negative-minded BULLIES on this planet.

President Obama has a message for you. Yes, you.

Also, Don't miss Reverend Al Sharpton's interview with President Obama airing tonight at 8pm ET on All In with Chris Hayes on MSNBC. Tune in!
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Neil Marsh | 103 | 1342126675883581_1342132882549627 | Obama sure is campaigning hard for Hillary!! Must be scared of something. Oh yea she has the goods on him lmfao.. democrats being exposed for exactly who they really are.. corrupt and lying criminals... RICO all over it
2 | Dave Papazoni | 51 | 1342126675883581_1342131302549785 | There he is, he who literally brews beer in The White House while Americans get killed in Libya. Simply put, Hillary Clinton is a dope.
3 | Arthur Villines | 25 | 1342126675883581_1342146349214947 | Obama's Message - Get ready citizens of ther US - We are goung to take all your money and give it to Illegals, but thanks for the 10 Trillion I spent and gave you nothing.
4 | Blake Duescher | 27 | 1342126675883581_1342150649214517 | Funny he wastes tax money campaigning for killary... Also had his own email bs and will be charged also if Hillary go's down that's why he's tried so hard to sweep this under the rug
5 | Marcia Freeman | 16 | 1342126675883581_1342167802546135 | I am not even American but somehow the message has to get through that that imbecile who is a despicable man by the name of Trump cannot be allowed to become president of the USA.... please go out and vote for Hilary, you do not want that man running your country!! He is a total joke and an embarrassment to the people of the USA.
6 | Steve Bishop | 7 | 1342126675883581_1342133719216210 | What will Obama's legacy be? With the collapse of Obamacare, historians have very little to go on other than he's the president who golfed more than worked.
7 | Tom Watson | 7 | 1342126675883581_1342146719214910 | we know who you are, and we don't believe what you say anymore. you sold out to big business and, to make matters worse, you pretend that you didn't. goodbye obama.
8 | Jimmy Mendoza | 3 | 1342126675883581_1342352642527651 | Hillary has made a mockery of her position in the White House as SOS .. She has used that office to embezzle incredible wealth, she took over Libya and raided their armory boxed it up and sent it straight to Syria, and was given a huge donation to her foundation.. She didn't want a strong military presence in Benghazi, she didn't need to many people aware of the "covert operation" .. Those 4 Americans were slaughtered while she reaped the millions ... Hillary/ObMa/ George Soros.. They have teamed together with CNN MSNBC   a plan to secure the majority of the Black vote.. The media depicts stories of cops shooting a black man.. (Purpose nor reason is explained) they instill fear anger and hostility throughout the black population, then HillaryBama paint a sympathetic narrative and adhere to ideas of oppression and a nationwide problem with our men and woman of law enforcement .. And this secures most of 30-40 million votes .. Meanwhile people are murdered both black and white.. Blood is spilled and they smile and await your vote.. The left is far more evil than Donald Trump.. The left is not your friend .. They are Godless people of power and fortune.. And that is not a lie
9 | Lisa An Ricks | 3 | 1342126675883581_1342681172494798 | She's essentially using African Americans for votes....that's nothing new in the Democratic Party. When are the Democrats going to pay it forward to the African Americans?Never. That's nothing new for the Democratic Party either. Use you, abuse you, and kick you to the side of the road. Wake up America before it's too late!
10 | Belinda Carver | 8 | 1342126675883581_1342149845881264 | I'd rather have a root canal than to listen to these two racist idiots talk.  I don't know which one's the worst, Barry the con man or Al the tax cheat and thief.
11 | Kris Rodriguez | 14 | 1342126675883581_1342137139215868 | Don't let Republitards fool you! Thing's are better than they left us! And thing's will only get Better! With them we will be in World War 3,We will have a President with No Moral's or Standards!
12 | Bill Breaux | 16 | 1342126675883581_1342142365882012 | VOTE TRUMP ! (OBAMA LIED TO AMERICANS FOR 8 YRS)   The following is a list of 23 famous Obama quotes that turned out to be broken promises or cold-hearted lies‚Ä¶#1 ‚ÄúIf you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.‚Äù#2 ‚ÄúMy administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in government.‚Äù#3 ‚ÄúWe agree on reforms that will finally reduce the costs of health care. Families will save on their premiums‚Ä¶‚Äù#4 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to pit Red America against Blue America. I want to be the president of the United States of America.‚Äù#5 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got shovel-ready projects all across the country that governors and mayors are pleading to fund. And the minute we can get those investments to the state level, jobs are going to be created.‚Äù#6 ‚ÄúAnd we will pursue the housing plan I‚Äôm outlining today. And through this plan, we will help between 7 and 9 million families restructure or refinance their mortgages so they can afford‚Äîavoid foreclosure.‚Äù#7 ‚ÄúI will sign a universal health-care bill into law by the end of my first term as president that will cover every American and cut the cost of a typical family‚Äôs premium by up to $2,500 a year.‚Äù#8 ‚ÄúWe reject the use of national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime.‚Äù#9 ‚ÄúFor people with insurance, the only impact of the health-care law is that their insurance is stronger, better, and more secure than it was before. Full stop. That‚Äôs it. They don‚Äôt have to worry about anything else.‚Äù#10 ‚ÄúWe will close the detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, the location of so many of the worst constitutional abuses in recent years.‚Äù#11 ‚ÄúAllow Americans to buy their medicines from other developed countries if the drugs are safe and prices are lower outside the U.S.‚Äù#12 ‚ÄúWe will revisit the Patriot Act and overturn unconstitutional executive decisions issued during the past eight years.‚Äù#13 ‚ÄúWill ensure that federal contracts over $25,000 are competitively bid.‚Äù#14 ‚ÄúWe reject sweeping claims of ‚Äòinherent‚Äô presidential power.‚Äù#15 ‚ÄúWill eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than $50,000 per year. This will eliminate taxes for 7 million seniors ‚Äî saving them an average of $1,400 a year‚Äì and will also mean that 27 million seniors will not need to file an income tax return at all.‚ÄùSecret blueprint for surviving the economic collapse (Ad)#16 ‚ÄúWe support constitutional protections and judicial oversight on any surveillance program involving Americans.‚Äù#17 ‚ÄúIf we have not gotten our troops out by the time I am president, it is the first thing I will do. I will get our troops home, we will end this war. You can take that to the bank.‚Äù#18 ‚ÄúWill not sign any non-emergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House website for five days.‚Äù#19 ‚ÄúThe President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.‚Äù#20 ‚ÄúWe have a choice in this country. We can accept a politics that breeds division and conflict and cynicism‚Ä¶. That is one option. Or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, ‚ÄòNot this time‚Ä¶.‚Äô‚Äù#21 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to spend some money now to pull us out of this recession. But as soon as we‚Äôre out of this recession, we‚Äôve got to get serious about starting to live within our means, instead of leaving debt for our children and our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren.‚Äù#22 ‚Äú[T]oday I‚Äôm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office. This will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we‚Äôve long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay ‚Äì and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.‚Äù#23 ‚ÄúI, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear that I will execute the office of president of the United States faithfully, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States.‚Äù
13 | Shane Jones | 10 | 1342126675883581_1342132205883028 | This is 2x that she's getting investigated, they had to find something big time because now the Democrats want the FBI director out. Some thing big time is going on and Weiner he must be ratting everyone out and scared to death since he became pedophile with an 15 year old.
14 | Yvonne Roessel | 1 | 1342126675883581_1342773525818896 | Thanks Obama! There is no way we can allow the orange mad man to destroy our recovery from the recession and destabilize the country by inciting violence, hatred of non-whites and disrespect of women, the military and the office of the President.
15 | Constance A Marshall | 5 | 1342126675883581_1342174559212126 | Message received loud & clear Mr President & we will protect your legacy & this country! I pray my fellow voters join me in welcoming Madam President & First Dude!
16 | James Parsons | 0 | 1342126675883581_1342411682521747 | You made Obama sound worse when you threw in Sharptons name.... Biggest racist in the National Media... Who should be in jail for insighting a riot....
17 | Kreg Mcmahon | 0 | 1342126675883581_1342853715810877 | I was asked how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughters? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste from a fellow deplorable Trump voter
18 | Roy Goodwin | 0 | 1342126675883581_1343017315794517 | Thanks for admitting you would never have been elected if it wasn't for young people, who know nothing about politics or political ideology, voting for you. I think that is the first honest thing you have said...
19 | Marion Rohling | 1 | 1342126675883581_1342726905823558 | Oh Dear....How You will be missed! I'm ready for all the nasty comments to follow, because I admire You, because I'm grateful to You, because You served us without scandal, because You brought honor & grace to our nation. The part of America who chooses to dishonor Your office by smearing and humiliating You, are showing the world out there that our choice for President means nothing, our constitution is just a farce and that we're nothing but a bunch of hoodlums. That we're not able to take care of our business with honor & dignity. You are the finest America has to offer!
20 | Frank Ruggles | 1 | 1342126675883581_1342316285864620 | Hard to believe anything he says when he lies about so much. the latest being that he didn't know Hillary was using a private email for State Dept business even though he emailed her on a regular basis.
21 | Dale Lange | 3 | 1342126675883581_1342188452544070 | How does he have time for this? Shouldn't he be trying to fix Obamacare for all those whose premiums are skyrocketing whilst facing the menacing hammer of the IRS if they don't pay up? Who came up with this nightmare?
22 | Carmen Letiska | 3 | 1342126675883581_1342158329213749 | Here is a man who goes to Cuba... chums it up with a brutal dictator, Raul Castro, in a stadium built by an oppressed people, only to then lecture Americans about slavery, in a country populated with an oppressed people. Obama was the BIGGEST SCAM on the American people.
23 | Seain O Ceallaigh | 0 | 1342126675883581_1343048295791419 | Vote for Hillary brought to you by if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor and i will save every American family 2500 dollars on their health insurance. Could you keep your doctor? did your health insurance go down. You bought what he was selling once do you want to do it again.
24 | Carmen Letiska | 6 | 1342126675883581_1342156662547249 | I voted for this piece of crap liar in 2012. He's been nothing but a liar. I lost my doctor and my insurance. I was then stuck with this ACA that I never agreed to. Not even Obama is signed on to the ACA. Instead of using our tax dollars to campaigning  for an overtly corrupt politician, why  don't you get to work!!!
25 | Christina Kook | 1 | 1342126675883581_1342177545878494 | "It is thus: On Tuesday, you are not making a genuine choice. Your vote is not between two sets of equally valid, but wildly differing visions for the future of the American experiment. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are not opposing ends of the same spectrum. This is no ‚Äúlesser of two evils.‚ÄùYou are, very simply, choosing between a voice that champions life, fundamental humanity and intelligence, and a voice that hisses only violence and death. Put another way: The choice between a thoughtful conversation and a thug‚Äôs knife in your kidney is no choice at all." Mark Morford SFGATE

Congressional GOP tries 'poisoning the well,' two years later http://on.msnbc.com/2fCvBJ4
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mary Wilkinson | 50 | 1342060435890205_1342061815890067 | The Republican Party CNN, MSNBC and other media outlets have taken America into a new low, also they  have convinced America its Ok to dehumanize, to speak of killing a candidate, to campaign spouting lies, to vote an insane man into office with a porn-star as "First Lady," and to threaten voters.
2 | Teresa Mac | 26 | 1342060435890205_1342066475889601 | Unbelievable that those people are already declaring they have no intention of working with Clinton if she's elected.  They've obviously forgotten they work for and are paid by the American people - ALL OF THEM.  I never thought I would be able to say that I've lost all respect for the Republican party, but now I can.
3 | Teresa Renae | 18 | 1342060435890205_1342071265889122 | WHY let republicans come on msnbc and say we should not elect her as she is under investigation (she is not) and may be indicted (no indication of that) YET you say nothing of Trump's many fraud cases, or more importantly his upcoming cases.  WHAT IS GOING ON?
4 | Elliott Reid | 14 | 1342060435890205_1342069812555934 | What does it take for the country to realize that Republicans care nothing for the country only their party. They spent all of Obamas presidency harming the country by refusing to work with him. He would have been overjoyed to have just one of them to work with.
5 | Allie AG | 12 | 1342060435890205_1342078392555076 | This behavior, this witchhunt is what has led me and my family to turn Democrat.  It's like a child, if they can't have their way they will throw a tantrum......at taxpayers expense no doubt.  I'm so angry!
6 | Julie Brown | 6 | 1342060435890205_1342080929221489 | The people do not want Trump or his wife for president and simply think she is not well educated enough for being America's First Lady. People would be snickering behind their hands at any meetings of spouses of foreign leaders regarding her nude photos on the Internet. Just not up for the job she can barely speak English well enough to be understood. Especially on TV. Trump is the biggest liar on the planet. And she lies too. Said she wrote the speech with a little help, totally untrue. She stole our current First Lady's speech. Both Trump's unqualified and unfit for the jobs they seek.
7 | Bette Fritz | 4 | 1342060435890205_1342272072535708 | Will they never learn?  This behavior is exactly what people are so angry about. Instead of getting to work on healthcare reform, immigration, etc., etc. they are planning to just waste time and money punishing the Dems for winning!  It is so exasperating.
8 | Marty Robinson | 5 | 1342060435890205_1342069009222681 | You just keep building up Trump and I'm sick of it, Trump should be in Jail, Hillary will be President if it is Trump we are in trouble Him and Putin will destroy the world..
9 | Terry Shillito | 0 | 1342060435890205_1342968795799369 | What bothers me is that there seems to be no way to work with republicans in any way. I fear the nation will be at a standstill until they are voted into minorities, and that could be another 5 or 10 years in the House. What's more, because Hillary will be president they will blame everything they muck up on her.
10 | Jacqueline Benjamin | 3 | 1342060435890205_1342099122553003 | The problem with the GOP is none of their former Presidents have been as successful as Bill Clinton, where having a non profit organisation is helping the poor and being respected. The Obamas will suffer the same faith when they leave office. Yes the foundation has gotten money from some countries that do not respect women rights but they have turned it around and help women with the same money. In African countries Aids medicines are now accessable to millions, women can now earn a living by being independent and opening businesses in their countries, persons with heart conditions are helped right in the US. This is not a now foundation it has been there for years, why don't the congress probe all the organisations that are set up to help VETS who never see one cent of the donations they collect for them. For these Republicans it is not about country, it is about themselves, but you Americans let them get away with too much, they shut down the country and people were blaming President Obama, where were your voices, Benghazi millions of dollars spent on how many hearings 7, 8, 9, 10 to hear the same evidence over and over, where were those for 9/11 or other embassies that were bombed during the reign of former Republican Presidents. Where were the probes into Powell or Condi emails. They are men who thinks that a woman should not be the head of any organisation.
11 | Pat Roberts | 3 | 1342060435890205_1342139809215601 | In the  long run, no matter what next week's outcome is, they have poisoned themselves...by their own hand and deeds.  Kismet has landed on them 'bigly'.      We really are devolving....
12 | Wanda Sgro | 4 | 1342060435890205_1342154315880817 | We have to fight for what's right!Get out vote blue and save our democracy!Do you think the Republicians will get the message if they try some of these things and we march on Washington!
13 | Robbie Woliver | 3 | 1342060435890205_1342110345885214 | MSNBC, why in the world is there a recurring scroll repeating word for word every quote from Trump's ad? So, he only has to run it once, and then you'll take it from there? Ugh...
14 | Kevin Maddox | 3 | 1342060435890205_1342103892552526 | Giuliani , What can you say about this man? I guess when your a friend of CONMAN Trump you lie about everything. And he's trying to get out of the big hole he's digging himself. This man is lie through his teeth.
15 | Paul Shipley | 4 | 1342060435890205_1342125105883738 | Where's Donald Trump? Is he running for president anymore? Haven't seen him for days. I see some guy that looks like he has a hand up his backside tossing his head from side to side reading off a teleprompter. That guy looks like a Republican puppet. Who's pulling the strings? Where's the real Donald Trump? This new guy is a joke.
16 | J John Siatras | 1 | 1342060435890205_1342152879214294 | All the main stream media is on the take via Hillary for Prison ! You cannot trust a word they tell you .I hope when Trump is elected he can bring charges on these people .

23 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 4 | 1342060435890205_1342070549222527 | The most important political story during the nearly eight years of the Obama presidency is how he delivered a neutron-bomb strike to his party. Obama and the political structure of America have been left standing ‚Äî but nearly 1,000 Democratic officeholders have been defeated.In the House of Representatives, three successive elections in 2010, 2012 and 2014 have seen 63 Democratic Congress members lose their seats. In 2009, Democrats held 60 Senate seats. Right now, they hold 46.So out of 535 elected positions in the US Congress, Obama has overseen a 14 percent reduction in Democratic officeholding ‚Äî and the loss of majorities in both chambers.Nationally, the numbers are even more stark. Democrats have lost 910 seats in state legislatures since 2009, while Republicans have gained 12 governor‚Äôs mansions. Overall, according to Louis Jacobson of Governing magazine, ‚ÄúDemocratic losses in the Senate have so far reached 22 percent, 27 percent in the House, 36 percent in governorships and a stunning 59 percent in fully controlled state legislatures.‚Äù NR.
