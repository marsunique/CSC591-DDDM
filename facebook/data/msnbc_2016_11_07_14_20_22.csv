1 | John Moore | 206 | 1344960665600182_1344962762266639 | Take another valium Kellyanne. You will not get to 270 easily. Vote for Hillary the only qualified and prepared leader to move our country forward.
2 | Mario Y Frank | 190 | 1344960665600182_1344962248933357 | Voting for Hillary Clinton because we need an adult in the White House
3 | Catherine Schoch | 99 | 1344960665600182_1344962518933330 | Hillary will be our next President, can't wait to cast my vote for her in Pa.
4 | Maree A. Gallagher | 70 | 1344960665600182_1344963032266612 | She's referring to Interstate 270, as they make their escape...
5 | Rhonda Ludlow | 43 | 1344960665600182_1344964158933166 | Trump not going to drain crap I guess his supporters didn't see the 1998 people article where trump said if he ever ran he would run as a Republican because Republican believe anything their stupid. Google it

7 | Kirstien Demuth | 16 | 1344960665600182_1344960785600170 | Listen up people, we are running out of time! Can you imagine the excitement on Wednesday morning when the Syrian people are told that Hillary won? They are going to be so happy knowing that they can now seek refuge in the USA! Hillary 2016
8 | Robin Lewallen | 4 | 1344960665600182_1344965762266339 | The only people that were surprised that Obama won in 2012 were the Republicans!!! Trump uses the polls in his favor when he's ahead and discredits them when he's losing .It's not even going to be close tomorrow. Why do you think he keeps talking about a rigged  election !!! Only people who know they are losing, say that!!!! IS IT TUESDAY YET !!!!!
9 | Hope Obioma Opara | 19 | 1344960665600182_1344964392266476 | Donald Trump, the King of Bankruptcy, professional conman, draft dodger, tax cheat and sexual predator is a psychotic self-absorbed narcissist. His style of hate-mongering politics makes America look like a third world country. The fact that he is even being considered for president is shameful. VOTE BLUE.
10 | Dave Haddix | 5 | 1344960665600182_1344965328933049 | It won't be so bad. We'll only be in the internment camps for about 10 years before climate change boils the oceans and we all drown anyway so ya know it's a win win.
11 | Timothy Reents | 0 | 1344960665600182_1344971448932437 | The bar is so low for the cry baby loser trump who chases story's of weiners, not winners.Untrustworthy Trump. Using fake polls, fake newspapers, fake news stories, trolls from all over the world to sell your propaganda... all the while Putin is building a new, much larger, KGB force....  Well seems really really UNTRUSTWORTHY TRUMP!The number of trump campaign staff that have active criminal investigations is growing fast! Thank you trump for being the law and order guy making it so easy to bring these "fringe individuals and groups" , both foreign and domestic,  out of the darkness and into the light of law enforcement.  I however would not support an amnesty deal for you in the process.
12 | Thomas Huntley | 0 | 1344960665600182_1344970448932537 | Obama won his second term in 2012 with 332 EC votes. Romney received 206 EC votes. With maybe two exceptions, HRC will win everything Obama won. Trump has to win all the states Romney won and still find at least 64 EC votes.
13 | James Carol Dodson | 0 | 1344960665600182_1344971248932457 | The only route that would get Trump to the White House is the Hi way to Hell. At least that's the one we'll all be on if he gets Elected. He should have been using AC / DC 'S Song all along as his Campaign' s theme.
14 | Carol Aulwes Jakl | 0 | 1344960665600182_1344970902265825 | I muted Kellyanne...couldn't listen to other word out of her mouth...always spin, spin never answers a question.  Hopefully, the whole lot of them will be gone after tomorrow.
15 | Katie LeClair | 2 | 1344960665600182_1344966072266308 | Maybe we should pass the hat for poor Kellyanne - who won't get paid when this is over bc she was hired to help him win, and he won't, so he won't be paying her...
16 | A.J. Pinto | 15 | 1344960665600182_1344960932266822 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...😂😂😂😂
17 | Timothy Reents | 0 | 1344960665600182_1344971152265800 | Hiding "voters" under sheets....Okay, fine. Let's dispense with the politesse. DT is a nazi. He grew up in the shadows of a father who was arrested at a KKK rally in the 1930s. At the time he took over the family business in the 1970s, DT was forced to settle with the Nixon administration for rampant racism in his business practices. In the 1980s, he took out a newspaper ad calling for the execution of five black teenagers accused of a crime they conclusively did not commit. In the 1990s, his ex wife told a court he keeps a copy of Hitler's speeches for bedside reading at night. In the 2000s, he led the birther movement to delegitimize the country's first African American president. Throughout his campaign, he has associated with known racists. He has frequently retweeted posts by neo nazis. So yes, let's dispose of political correctness. Donald Trump is a racist and a fascist, the combination of which makes him a nazi. And people who support him, whether they admit it or not, either sympathize with his racism and hatred or live in a moral universe where Hillary's emails etc. somehow supersede the total moral failure of their candidate, a greedy, megalomaniac narcissist who exploits fear and hatred to advance his personal interests. So as you take a look at the profile pictures of the people in this comment stream who stand up to defend this indefensible man, kindly notice a pattern: they are almost all white, indeed almost all white men. They are inadvertently outing themselves. But don't kid yourselves. We see you. And we know who you are.
18 | Raymond Bass | 4 | 1344960665600182_1344964205599828 | To those voters still undecided…. Which Candidate:01.	Threatened to lock up thousands of people? 02.	Threatened to lock up his opponent? 03.	Threatened to deport millions, including children born here? 04.	Threatened to force people to wear Religious ID’s 05.	Threatened to have people beaten up, shot? 06.	Threatened to get rid of the Environmental Protection Agency? 07.	Threatened to privatize Medicare and Social Security? 08.	Threatened to raise the retirement age and benefits for Social Security? 09.	Threatened Freedom of the Press? 10.	Threatened to assassinate foreign leaders? 11.	Threatened to refuse to accept defeat, should he lose? There’s a common thread through all of this, I think. However, it doesn’t matter what I think, as I have already made up my mind. Let me ask you: After reading the above, which candidate do You think represents a Threat, to this country, to you, to me, to your children, grandchildren?  He is clearly not worthy of your vote.rb 7 November2 2016
19 | Otto Barrera | 4 | 1344960665600182_1344962158933366 | Man, after watching Obama sending troops to Iraq Mosul and push a fast attack on ISIS, killing innocent civilians just to get votes for Hillary... I can see democrats are violent, careless people. No respect for human life. But I rather die for my freedoms confronting anybody that wants to enslave me.
20 | Barbara Howard | 0 | 1344960665600182_1344972255599023 | NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  route 666 ??? Agreed we need a adult in the White House that knows which end is up or at least can tie their shoestring....Kellyanne talking like Tweety Bird is over ~ I hope...annoying ~~
21 | Langston Montierth | 0 | 1344960665600182_1344968992266016 | In Greek tradition she should be ostracized and forced to leave the country -Trump should be allowed to stay as the public reminder of what feckless people can do.
22 | Cees Mouthaan | 0 | 1344960665600182_1344966512266264 | Six different paths that all rely on the same thing.

23 | Ric Berrong | 2 | 1344960665600182_1344964478933134 | ... poor Kellyanne Conway, all credibility lost after she rented her soul to Donald J Trump and went on numerous talk shows spewing his lies and barely able to defend his rants, so she goes on her own without answering any questions asked of her
24 | Tony Carver | 0 | 1344960665600182_1344971738932408 | 😂 "Six routes to 270"..... that comment is strictly for the Teapublican base that can't use Math! Don't get me wrong there is still a slim chance this national nightmare that is Trump could still become President, but there is No Where close to "six different routes"; more like one very small and still barely open window that is rapidly closing.
25 | Tristen Schoppaul | 0 | 1344960665600182_1344972552265660 | Hate to say I hope so, he's the lesser evil. Clinton should be charged w treason, fraud, tampering w government property, espionage, and corruption.

2 | Patrick Michael | 41 | 1344913025604946_1344917328937849 | Woooooohoooo! That's 3 more points than Obama had in 2012. I just hope we get to see a picture of Trump filling up his car, crying, bronzer running down his face like we got to see mittens do in 2012. Oh what a dream that would be.
3 | Stefan HG | 33 | 1344913025604946_1344913168938265 | Make no mistake, the election's rigged in corrupt and dishonest Hillary's favor!!! Just ask "The Bern."BTW, just like Bernie warned you about the Wall Street types, Crooked Hillary's their most adored darling!

6 | Joyce Ann Serafini | 4 | 1344913025604946_1344955925600656 | Trump is stupid, the FBI even explained how they check e-mails auto...selected just e-mails  during Hillary's State Dept. years, and with the headers found they were just duplicates of ones they had alredy seen...but  FBI Comey should resign immediately...for his July remarks, and these 2 follow up letters....he has brought the whole FBI into policial terrority...and against the rules...

It's going to feel good to say "You fools elected her, you fools deserve to feel the pain"..... The smart ones who saw through her and the corrupt people who have supported and protected her will have taken steps to make sure her reign in power has little affect on our lives............ fools.....all of you left supporters! Enjoy the dictatorship you have put into power.
12 | Shawn Arkebauer | 1 | 1344913025604946_1344927188936863 | Americans and legal immigrants and veterans and border patrol and police and GOD fearing people and working people for Trump. Celebrity millionaires and millionaire Wall Street cronies and deadbeats and foreign donors for Clinton. Think of NAFTA and other trade deals, insurance premiums skyrocketing, and 20 TRILLION in debt and climbing. Sorry, I do not have time to reply back to people that do not see this.

14 | Tracy Curry Beam | 7 | 1344913025604946_1344916755604573 | When you are forced to pay a penalty because you cannot afford health insurance (yes, some can't afford even Obamacare), then you are no longer a free country. When we have open borders instead of knowing who is coming into our country, we are a country destine to fall. When illegal immigrants take priority over our veterans, homeless and the poor, we no longer are a country that cares for her own first. Remember this when you cast your ballot tomorrow. Don't vote for Hillary just because she is a woman. There will be better women to chose from later in our time.
15 | Colleen Rowe | 0 | 1344913025604946_1344957648933817 | 12 year old boy was asked if his parents are republican or democratic. He said republican. He was asked if he could vote, would he vote for trump too. He said no he would vote for Clinton just like his mom and dad. He was asked why he would vote for Hillary. He replied because she is out to help the children, women and she already knows the job. If she needs help she can ask her husband because he already did the job. He was told that trump claims that he loves children and wants to do good for them. The boy said she is already doing the job and trump is just talking and he makes women cry. He's a bully and not the person I want to be like. I'm going to run for class president and help the children too like Hillary.

18 | Cathy Politte Stahlman | 0 | 1344913025604946_1344963822266533 | The New York Times reported that aides to Bill Clinton started a Canadian charity which essentially shielded the identities of donors to his foundation. Bill did this even though Hillary had signed a pledge of transparency when she started her position as Secretary of State, as per Breitbart. This action covered up who donated $20 million to $33 million!
19 | Todd Dorsey | 0 | 1344913025604946_1344958308933751 | For those of you who still haven't voted yet the because you haven't had a chance or because you don't know who to vote for it's pretty simple. Are you happy with the way things have gone the last eight years are you happy with our economy, our  standing in the world , with the unemployment,  the way our vets have been treated, our 20 trillion in debt, high tuition costs, giving Iran billions, giving 50% of our uranium to putin, etc. If you're happy with all those things then the choice is clear then you should vote for Hillary because you cannot blame anything on trump. He as not been in office. Hillary's hands are all over all of the decisions that have been made in the last 8 years.
20 | John Moore | 2 | 1344913025604946_1344943905601858 | Hillary is the only prepared and qualified candidate to lead our already great country forward. Vote for Hillary and a straight democratic ticket, time to stop the GOP gridlock in congress!
21 | Chuck Leach | 1 | 1344913025604946_1344967532266162 | That's a huge lead for the last poll before election day. Remember Obama had a 1.5 point lead 4 years ago and  2.5 points eight years ago and he won both elections by a lot!
22 | Deidra Sands | 0 | 1344913025604946_1344934428936139 | Donald Trump’s campaign has set a historic standard for lack of transparency. In addition to refusing to release his tax returns, complete medical records, or any evidence of his charitable giving, he has also declined to make public the names of any “bundlers” — supporters who collect bundles of checks to give to the campaign.

Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump are tied in the latest poll from battleground Florida.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Patricia Prokop | 111 | 1344854948944087_1344865838942998 | Hillary has an excellent ground game. I've had visits from two different volunteers making sure I plan to vote. Never before in my thirty years of residence in this Ohio village has this happened.
2 | Andy Charles | 78 | 1344854948944087_1344857082277207 | I can't way to get all of my handouts!!! Oh wait, I am a white middle class conservative, I'll be paying for those handouts. Dang, I need to think about making a change. Let's go Hillary !! Keep America as a poverty crime ridden cesspool. America is great. Hillary 2016!! We will miss you Barack:)
3 | Belinda Sullivan | 52 | 1344854948944087_1344858338943748 | One thing for sure no one should be getting cocky. Polls are rolling all over the place these past 3 days. Polls do not matter. They are wrong more than they are right. The early voting lines were long. Be prepared to wait. Get out there and VOTE
4 | Blair D. Scott Sr. | 30 | 1344854948944087_1344875252275390 | The people have spoken by "Voting Early", and most of them have given their "VOTES", to Hillary. Trump pissed off the Latinos, and they came out in full force, for Hillary, all over America, he attacked the Blacks, with his "What else do you have", and we aren't "Voting", for him, he attacked the Muslims, and they're not "Voting", for him, he "Degraded Women", and that was his "NAIL", in the coffin, he then attacked the Jews, and they laughed and said, we're with her. So Trump, you became your own enemy with your "Evil Heart, and Wicked Mouth". We all heard you and you kept repeating it, even your followers, repeated what you said. I'm not following the polls, I'm following my feet, straight to the "Voting Box", and "Vote", for the only person, "Qualified, Fit, Cares, Stable, Experienced, Mentally Capable", and that person name is "Hillary Clinton", "I'm With Her"
5 | David Aldo | 26 | 1344854948944087_1344861582276757 | I voted more than a week ago. Have you voted yet? If not, get out there and vote today or tomorrow...and remember, you have the law on your side. There will be Vote Suppressors out their in full force. Just remember these few rules and laws that protect you.• Campaigners, or in this case,  Trumpian Agitators and Agent Provocateurs cannot stand right in front of a polling  location. They must be 100 feet away. If they aren't, then you have a legal right and obligation to let poll workers know...and they should be able to correct the action.• If the Campaigner/Agitator blocks your entrance, you need to tell a poll worker that they need to enforce the rules. If you can't get the poll worker because you are scared...then you have a right to call law enforcement to assist you.• If the Campaigner/Agitator touches you in anyway, that is considered assault and you have the law on your side.Don't be afraid to vote and to be intimidated not to vote. But, don't confront them either. They are angry, hateful, negative and many cases dangerous. They have an agenda and one goal in mind! That is to keep Patriotic Americans from exercising one the most valued rights in this country...and that is your right and Patriotic duty to vote. Democrats, Liberals, Progressives and Rational Republicans...Be Strong...Be Calm...Be vigilant...Be Persistent...Stand Your Ground...and don't let them intimidate you. The best way to prevent them from accomplishing their attempts to suppress your vote...is WITH your vote. Let's Elect the First woman POTUS in History...and #VoteBlueNoMatterWho! All the way down the ballot. Let's Give Hillary Clinton a Congress that WILL NOT obstruct Hillary Clinton and prevent our country from progressing forward!
6 | Robert R. Ferguson | 14 | 1344854948944087_1344868078942774 | I can believe my home state would go for such a sick person as Trump -- let's return to some sensible ideas of bring everyone together and moving forward, and that includes modern, sensible
7 | Blair D. Scott Sr. | 7 | 1344854948944087_1344913592271556 | Trump, when you attack People of Color remember, we have a way of making you pay for what you said, it was done without "Violence, or Riots". We all decided to make sure we "VOTE", and not allow, a "Racist, Bigot", to be President. We People of Color, have had enough of the "Racist Remarks" against us, because we look different, and we all don't live in a "Poor Neighborhoods", that look like "Afghanistan", we all don't live in "High Crime Places", we do have a "A Lot To Lose", and what we have to lose, is allowing you Trump, to be President, because you would give the "KKK, White Supremacy, Alt-Right", all the permission they need, to take us back, and we aren't having it. So us "People of Color", we gave our "Votes", to the only person, "Qualified, Cares, Not a Racist, Fit, Stable" and that person name is "Hillary Clinton", we're with her..
8 | Frank A. Mirabella | 2 | 1344854948944087_1344876028941979 | I just don't get why so many people with political expertise are calling Florida for Clinton. Most of the major media polls are using a model where Democrat's turnout is being oversampled by 8% to 9%. The early voting returns don't indicate that is what's going to occur on Tuesday. These same major polls are indicating only a 1% to 2% win for Clinton in Florida. The polls have more than already over compensated for any surprises such as the extraordinary Puerto Rican voter turnout.

10 | Lisa Paoline | 0 | 1344854948944087_1344926062270309 | If you Vote for Clinton....please REMEMBER...When you are voting for a woman's right to choose you are also voting for late-term abortions even through the 9th month!When you are voting to welcome hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees because you want to give them a chance for a better life here in America... You understand that Hillary herself said Vetting canNOT be done!! And- There is no way to guarantee that some coming through will not be coming here to do us harm. And.....You will also be voting for you & your neighbors and all of us in America to financially care for these individuals-  that means their housing, their Healthcare, their food stamps, their education, etc.....No matter what You are being told....it will be taxpayers like us that foot the bill!!!  You will be also voting for the influx of unavoidable side-effect of many new and unfamiliar and possibly diseases and illnesses that we in the U.S. have previously eradicated.  You will also be voting in favor of having these individuals fight for jobs that many Americans are struggling for obtain or keep right now. When you vote for Hillary Clinton you will be voting for open borders.  And you might be thinking that you are doing a wonderful thing for those that are trying to get in America to make a better life for themselves... but remember-  those individuals who will be coming through will need some type of government assistance.  With all of these extra people to care for we are going to have even a greater difficulty caring for those that are living in or around the poverty line!  It could also reduce our ability to keep those who have been sent away because they committed dangerous crimes!! (Like the man who had been deported 5 times for various crimes and returned to rape a 10 year old girl on a bus!!!)When you are voting for Hillary Clinton you are voting for higher taxes for the "wealthy" -  but that also means that the "wealthy" will have less money to put back into our economy.  Eventually after YEARS of steep tax increases, some of these "wealthy," may not qualify to have to contribute, as they may become middle class.  After YEARS of the wealthy being dried up after being heavily tapped into... the next group of people to be taxed will be the middle class.  (We cannot rationally assume that the "wealthy" have unending streams of income.)You will also be voting to continue with Obamacare- and this year alone premiums are going up 100% in some states!!!You will be voting for a candidate that claimed she is for women's rights but... you will also be voting for the candidate that through her foundation has accepted hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign governments that oppress and openly kill women and girls in the streets for not conforming to radical religious beliefs!!! You will be voting for the candidate that  States her opponent is Putin's BFF but you'll also be voting for the candidate they gave Russia 20% of our uranium!!! You will be voting for a candidate that dodged FBI charges of criminal wrongdoing in her recent email investigation... but you will also be voting for the candidate that the FBI director called Reckless and used EXTREME CARELESSNESS in handling Government correspondence, that with 99% CERTAINTY WAS HACKED BY Five ADVERSARIAL FOREIGN CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES!!!

13 | Debbie Parker | 0 | 1344854948944087_1344917508937831 | Here is more - Found this ....BILL CLINTON'S LOVING WIFE --- by DICK MORRISIf you happen to see the Bill Clinton five minute TV ad for Hillary in which he introduces the commercial by saying he wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary's background, beware as I was there for most of their presidency and know them better than just about anyone. I offer a few corrections:Bill says: "In law school Hillary worked on legal services for the poor."Facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in 'Law School' was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a 'Federal Agent.' She went to Court every day as part of a Law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.Bill says: "Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a Children's rights project for poor kids."Facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.Bill says: "Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers."Facts are: She flunked the D.C. bar exam, 'Yes', flunked it, it is a matter of record, and only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas, 'None', and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She did not join the prestigious Rose Law Firm until Bill became Arkansas Attorney General and was made a partner only after he was elected Arkansas Governor.Bill says: "President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its Chairman."Facts are: The appointment was in exchange for Bill's support for Carter in his 1980 primary against Ted Kennedy. Hillary then became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter's choice to be chairman.Bill says: "She served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital."Facts are: Yes she did. But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the Wal-Mart Board of Directors, for a substantial fee. She was silent about their labor and health care practices.Bill says: "Hillary didn't succeed at getting health care for all Americans in 1994 but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance."Facts are: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. I know; I helped to negotiate the deal. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals' tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.Bill says: "Hillary was the face of America all over the World." (LOL)Facts are: Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House. Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them.Bill says: "Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for Children's and Women's issues."Facts are: Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation. One set up a national park in Puerto Rico. A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid 911 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire N.Y. delegation. Presently she is trying to have the US memorialize Woodstock.Here is what bothers me more than anything else about Hillary Clinton. She has done everything possible to weaken the President and our Country (that's you and me) when it comes to the 'War on Terror'.1. She wants to close GITMO and move the combatants to the USA where they would have access to our legal system.2. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of suspected Al Qaeda phone calls to/from the USA.3. She wants to grant constitutional rights to enemy combatants captured on the battlefield.4. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of money transfers between suspected Al Qaeda cells and supporters in the USA.5. She wants to eliminate the type of interrogation tactics used by the Military & CIA where coercion might be used when questioning known terrorists even though such tactics might save American lives.One cannot think of a single 'Bill', Hillary has introduced or a single comment she has made that would tend to strengthen our Country in the 'War on Terror'. But, one can think of a lot of comments she has made that weaken our Country and makes it a more dangerous situation for all of us. Bottom line: She goes hand in hand with the ACLU on far too many issues where common sense is abandoned.Share this with everyone you know, ask them to prove Dick Morris wrong. Think about it - he's (Dick Morris) said all of this openly, thus if he were not truthful he'd be liable for 'Defamation of Character' !And you better believe Hillary would sue him.Her winning in 2016 means the final death knell for America! Her whole public life has been a LIE.By Dick Morris, former political advisor to President Bill ClintonTHERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE UNAWARE OF THESE FACTS

First step go for the guns. As Hillary said she will reverse the Heller decision and make us like Australia. 1,000,000 more unborn babies will die after she lifts all abortion restrictions and has taxpayers funded abortions.

The only factual evidence that we have is early voting, and all indications point to the fact that Hillary Clinton is leading Donald " The Crook " Trump in all the swing states.

Hillary offered them plans and aid for transitioning to a bright future. Politics did not kill coal, progress did and it is in decline around the world. Denying the facts doesn't change them. Not Trump or anyone else can bring back coal. You might as well say lets bring back whale blubber. To everything there is a season.

Hillary Clinton campaigned with Gold Star father Khizr Khan, who famously riled Donald J. Trump with his DNC speech questioning whether Trump had read the U.S. Constitution.

1 | Derek Leslie | 93 | 1560788930607798_1560792803940744 | Mr Khan, standing on the memory of his dead son. His son was a patriot. Mr Khan, you are bought and paid for by the DNC. It is sickening the way you have used your son.

3 | Jack Morris | 26 | 1560788930607798_1560795620607129 | Ten reasons to vote Democrat #10. I vote Democrat because I love the fact that I can now marry whatever I want. I've decided to marry my German Shepherd.#9. I vote Democrat because I believe oil companies' profits of 4% on a gallon of gas are obscene, but the government taxing the same gallon at 15% isn't.#8. I vote Democrat because I believe the government will do a better job of spending the money I earn than I would.#7. I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is fine as long as nobody is offended by it.#6. I vote Democrat because I'm way too irresponsible to own a gun, and I know that my local police are all I need to protect me from murderers and thieves. I am also thankful that we have a 911 service that gets police to your home in order to identify your body after a home invasion. It will take the police an average of about 15 minutes to get to your house; 00 buckshot travels at about 1200 ft/sec.#5. I vote Democrat because I'm not concerned about millions of babies being aborted so long as we keep all death row inmates alive and comfy.#4. I vote Democrat because I think illegal aliens have a right to free health care, education, and Social Security benefits, and we should take away Social Security from those who paid into it.#3. I vote Democrat because I believe that businesses should not be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to break even and give the rest away to the government for redistribution as the Democrat Party sees fit.#2. I vote Democrat because I believe liberal judges need to rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit fringe kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters.And, the #1 reason I vote Democrat is because I think it's better to pay $billions$ for oil to people who hate us, but not drill our own because it might upset some endangered beetle, gopher, or fish here in America. We don't care about the beetles, gophers, or fish in those other countries

19 | John McCarthy | 0 | 1560788930607798_1560922673927757 | VIA| On Sunday, Wikileaks gave Hillary Clinton less than a 24-hour window to drop out of the race or they will dump something that will destroy her “completely.”Recently, Julian Assange confirmed that WikiLeaks was not working with the Russian government, but in their pursuit of justice they are obligated to release anything that they can to bring light to a corrupt system – and who could possibly be more corrupt than Crooked Hillary?“The Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything. Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That’s false – we can say that the Russian government is not the source,” Assange said in a recent interview. “Hillary Clinton is just one person. I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick – for example faint – as a result of going on, and going with their ambitions. But she represents a whole network of people, and a whole network of relationships with particular states.”“Hey, @HillaryClinton, you have until Monday to drop out, or we will destroy you completely,” the cryptic tweet says.

4 | Tony Johnson | 110 | 1344796568949925_1344801465616102 | ... you mean The White House that Trump, Gingrich, & Giuliani plan to build out of Chinese steel after they're denied the one on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?...😂😂

6 | Javier Rodriguez | 125 | 1344796568949925_1344797128949869 | Bernie supporters, stop acting like fools and start supporting a realistic candidate in Hillary. It's time for you to fall in line so Hillary can win this election. #HillaryorBust #BerntOut.

The problem is if he were win, the checks and balances would go out the window...A GOP supreme court, a GOP attorney general, a GOP FBI head...and a GOP congress..We would probably never have another election..As Maher said, "a facist once in, does not give up his power."

9 | Richard-Donna Cabrey | 48 | 1344796568949925_1344801238949458 | Copy from Facebook page of Kevin M Carney(opposing Views.) A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!
10 | Debra Lines | 8 | 1344796568949925_1344825892280326 | Can you imagine the conversations between these stooges! Don't forget Roger. I think more realistically this gang will likely be in dumpsters hotel looking out the window at The Whitehouse crying, throwing "tremendous" mantrums... 😂
11 | Bob Stern | 5 | 1344796568949925_661949627307609 | The fact that these 2 jamokes (Giuliani, and Gingrich) are being mentioned as possibly being in the Orange Man's administration should immediately make you run to the election booth and cast your vote for Hillary!!
12 | Becky Hostetter | 10 | 1344796568949925_1344835978945984 | They are campaigning with Trump specifically to get appointed in his administration. We CANNOT allow this!!  Vote down Trump and ALL candidates who support him, and vote EVERY 2 YEARS from now on. Once we clear our local, state and federal governments of people like this, ALL our lives will improve!! Get it done America!!
13 | Angus Palo Grande | 12 | 1344796568949925_1344798205616428 | Hell no!! His going to try to get back  w/his ex wife he left a few years ago. Hillary is going to win. Newt is a disgrace for supporting Trump.
14 | Caitrin Bayard | 8 | 1344796568949925_1344837808945801 | Bunch of delusional old white men trying to hold on to antiquated ideologies of generations oppression...you do not represent us all...just those that a grasping & clawing trying to maintain your status...you will be defeated
15 | David Sillman | 19 | 1344796568949925_1344804512282464 | There will be no Trump White House. Trump will be prosecuted (and hopefully jailed), divorced and forever publicly disgraced within a year. Newt & Giuliani will hopefully drop dead (of natural causes) within a year too. Sorry, but they're a threat to society (and they've already lived long, reprehensible lives).
16 | Jacqueline Stevens | 8 | 1344796568949925_1344833302279585 | Not any surprise! Giuliani's ties to the FBI is how this all came about. Why else would he be with Trump? They're all racists. Let's be real.
17 | Edith Stanley | 5 | 1344796568949925_1797882893816776 | The only thing Gingrich and Giuliani will get after Election Day is a  new gig on Fox's propaganda channel where they will continue to spew all the hateful puke.
18 | Jim James | 3 | 1344796568949925_1797891747149224 | Gingrich and Giuliani? Abbott and Costello? Laurel and Hardy? The difference is the latter twosomes were comedians. The first two think people take them seriously. Seriously....????
19 | Debbie Parker | 1 | 1344796568949925_1797879390483793 | Hillary's real accomplishments:•let's all get honest Hillary Clinton was the one who exposed her emails to the Russians , if anyone is guilty of promoting espionage it is Hillary •she lied about her server setup•she lied about using several devises•she lied about sending classified and top secret documents over her unsecured illegal server•she lied about having permission to set it up•she lied about turning over all work related emails•she lied about sharing top secret and classified documents with people who had no security clearance•she directed her staff to remove classified and top secret markings from documents and send them unsecured (this is against the law)•she destroyed and then lied about destroying government documents that belong to the American people (which by the way is against the law)•she had her attorneys and the man who set up her server handling classified information and top secret information who did not have the security clearance (for which this too is illegal)•she committed perjury when testifying at the Benghazi hearing•"Clinton Cash" tells the story of their corruption •the corruption in the DNC working with her and rigging the system while working with Hillary's attorneys•selling access to Obama and herself at the DNC •the hacking of her email now, first she told us the 33,000 emails were personal and now they are calling them a threat to national security, if they were a national security risk than she lied about them being personal and that means she criminally destroyed federal documents and someone has top secret and classified information on our country "WHICH MEANS AS PRESIDENT SHE COULD BE BLACKMAILED INTO DOING SOMETHING DANGEROUS TO AMERICAN LIVES!"•Hatti, Africa, Columbia, the Congo and Nigeria•sold 20% of America's uranium to Russia •taken money from the Persian countries that rape women and children, burn Christians alive, drown people alive, behead people, drive trucks over innocent people, hang gays and lesbians and bomb indiscriminately •Iraqi, Libya and Syria are in total disarray because of her so called accomplishments•and let's not forget her mentor who was a card carrying KKK member well known for saying "I will never serve with a black man by my side." She did her thesis on this guy and to this day still praises this man•no American flags at her convention until the press pressured them to•audience was told "no American flags waving in the audience because it might offend someone," yet I personally saw Russian, North Korean, Palestinian and Mexican flags•Wants to increase the refugee to America 550% knowing the FBI said we can expect more attacks like Paris, Istanbul and Germany in the USA. "Rapes and human trafficking are already happening in Germany and yes America" but the mainstream media isn't telling you that.•we have rioting in our streets and have become an "us against them" more than we have ever been in years•we have hate groups being praised by the president and by Hillary and the DNC that are calling for death to police and whites•we now know that Hillary has used the Secretary of State position to her donors in pay to play, this is highly illegal and she is being investigated for itGreat job democrats!     Vote Trump 🇺🇸
20 | Allison Attong-Rogers | 1 | 1344796568949925_661969073972331 | Well if people really vote for Trump tomorrow and the country will be run by some of the world's most famous liars and cheaters we are in a lot of trouble.  Multiple wives, cheaters, haters of anything not like them is what we will get.  Guiliani and Gingrich will of course run the White House because Trump of course does know what he is doing.   Vote Blue.  Vote Hillary Clinton #imwithher and remember the Democratic down ballots too.  We have to get the obstructionists in Congress out of office.
21 | Rob Byrne | 2 | 1344796568949925_661941060641799 | They'll all be working diligently on Newt's previous proposal that the US spend its federal dollars developing condominiums on the Moon.  (You may have forgotten, he actually suggested it).
22 | Thomson Tembo | 0 | 1344796568949925_1344856558943926 | Sometimes, even when there are no formulas to certain situations or things in life, there is  surely a way to figure out things using ways and principles of relativity. Okay let's not involve the intricacies of physics too much here. What I'm Saying is that if you look at Giuliani and Gingrich and Huckabee last but not least , all have one thing in common,  they have tried to run for primary presidential  nomination and all have failed. That's one half of the status quo in the sphere of public observation thus far. Now if you were to reflect that status quo projecting it for the future, it still looks and reflects the same way the original one looks like. In other words, they say that if you are badly ( like power hungry) looking for something in life, it just never comes.
23 | Jeannie Elliott | 2 | 1344796568949925_661959153973323 | Trump says - If l lose what a big waste of time and money. Trump also said- He has a nice life he will go back to.  Hillary ran in 2008, lost and campaigned for Obama and was his SOS in his 1st term. She then takes on the incredibly difficult task of running again. Hillary doesn't give up and doesn't complain. And she loves this country enough to put herself out there for it twice!
24 | Deb Sherman | 4 | 1344796568949925_661951713974067 | Just one more reason not to vote Trump... we don't need these two idiots anywhere near the White House!!  But I guess "cheaters" stick together... just how many wives do they have between them??
25 | Myra Mikie Friedman | 3 | 1344796568949925_1797887060483026 | OMG!  look at them!  i mean really look at them! These two fat old white adulterers who have absolutely no scruples or morals running our country! that is not the American dream! That is the American nightmare! OMG!

Gary Johnson: "I'm upset if either one of them win and that's why I'm in the race... I'm going to give people a first choice."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Charles Reese | 148 | 1344739275622321_1344742282288687 | Johnson is a bad joke.  His running mate has enough intelligence to understand that a vote for them would be a vote for Trump.
2 | Russ Sachleben | 86 | 1344739275622321_1344744345621814 | If Clinton and trump both died tomorrow their replacements will beat Johnson by the same margins. He isn't a choice but a small distraction
3 | Jennifer Moss Kincaid | 21 | 1344739275622321_1344755532287362 | If Johnson was a serious candidate maybe he could have made a difference, but he's not. I think the only way a third party could have changed this election is if Bernie Sanders ran as an independent - and then Trump would have won, so thank you Bernie.
4 | Richard S. Simon | 26 | 1344739275622321_1344759308953651 | Gary, I hold my nose when I see you on TV. To think that you consider yourself an alternative to Hillary is a national joke.
5 | Linda Barney | 11 | 1344739275622321_1344771242285791 | Johnsons running mate might have given them a chance at a bigger impact had he been the top of the ticket. Johnson is as bad as Trump when it comes to lack of baseline knowledge for even the average informed voter.
6 | Jill Love | 5 | 1344739275622321_1344929518936630 | Sorry Gary you seem nice enough but just not knowledgeable enough. Listen to your running mate.. your only helping a man you profess to dislike.. voting for Gary Johnson is voting for Donald Trump.. that's a fact..
7 | Al Plumlee | 6 | 1344739275622321_1344784965617752 | Johnson may have been paid by the Trump campaign to stay in the race so as to take votes away from Hillary. Just vote based on what your true interests are not those opinions planted in your brain by the Trump propagandists.
8 | Barbara Kiourkas | 12 | 1344739275622321_1344778352285080 | No offense, but Gary Johnson would be my last choice, right behind Daffy Duck. If Bill Weld had run instead, we might be talking a different ball game..
9 | Ed Levine | 0 | 1344739275622321_1344964842266431 | Let's see, he didn't know that Aleppo was a place, he thinks that global warming doesn't matter because eventually the sun will swallow the earth, (in a few billion years) he couldn't name on current world leader, but he thinks he should be president? That is beyond dumb.
10 | Todd Sabine | 1 | 1344739275622321_1344886652274250 | Then you're going to be upset Ya ding-a-ling! Because one of them "IS" going to win. And because of you pulling some votes there's a chance Trump will win. So thanks for that! Go out, create your movement, and come back when you can be more than a spoiler. There is to much on the line for your to little, to late, marginal effort.
11 | Janie Romine | 1 | 1344739275622321_1344940975602151 | Ohhhh bless your heart Gary, go smoke a bowl - even your running mate has put country over self in this race. Thank you Gov Weld for your wise and honest words about what's important in this election. #NeverTrump

14 | Jamie Buckerfield | 4 | 1344739275622321_1344792768950305 | I suppose that the one good thing that can be said about this simpleton is that he will be soon - VERY soon - forgotten. Little more than a nuisance, and about as consequential and annoying as a fly in your living room.
15 | Sharon Olski | 1 | 1344739275622321_1344785255617723 | A "choice" that, sadly, simply wastes their vote used on you. No electoral coming your way, and your scatter brained non-answers also showed no ability for this office.

18 | Bruce Lewis | 3 | 1344739275622321_1344762825619966 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.REASONS TO NOT VOTE HILLARY⚠If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?👁⚠If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.👁⚠If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.👁⚠If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.👁⚠If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.👁⚠If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.👁⚠If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped?

19 | Jo Anna Jameson | 1 | 1344739275622321_1344811048948477 | Johnson implies that it does not matter whether DT or HRC is elected President. Most of us do not agree. We do agree with former Gov. William Weld who spoke out for HRC recently. Thank you for your courage Gov. Weld.
20 | Joseph Matthews | 2 | 1344739275622321_1344756882287227 | Why does MSNBC or CNN bother to pay reporters to follow the Clinton campaign? They will not ask her any real or tough questions if she holds her once-in-a-lifetime one-minute press gatherings. They all like Chris Matthews and Barack Obama seem to have a warm chill run up their legs whenever Mrs. Clinton bothers to grace them with her time. A reporter just prefaced the press corps' lone question "question" to Mrs. Clinton this morning with the phrase "you have faced so much prejudice" in this campaign. Boy, that's real objective and shows she's really searching for the truth. Every reporter "covering" Mrs. Clinton should wear cheerleading uniforms and wave pom poms. I always wondered what Pravda looked like in the old Soviet Union and why they would sell their souls and sell out their countrymen by reporting nothing but propaganda. I now see that same propaganda every day on the government-run media like CNN and MSNBC. I cannot fathom the amount of embarrassment and shame these reporters and on-air analysts must feel deep-down inside for being nothing but shills for these corrupt people. It would be an embarrassment if she is the first woman to wear the mantle as the first female to be elected president. Chelsea spent $3 million from the Clinton Foundation to pay for her extravagant wedding and there's no reporting except on the one fair and balanced network on that? Sad.
21 | Star Marie | 1 | 1344739275622321_1344806188948963 | Vote! Vote! Vote! Get to your polling place and cast your ballot for Donald J. Trump! Make sure everyone you know votes, too. Offer a ride, whatever is needed. This is SO important to our country! We MUST turn out in force, and that means ALL of us! Every single vote counts and matters! Let's get it done! #Trump2016
22 | Todd Dorsey | 0 | 1344739275622321_1344958608933721 | For those of you who still haven't voted yet the because you haven't had a chance or because you don't know who to vote for it's pretty simple. Are you happy with the way things have gone the last eight years are you happy with our economy, our  standing in the world , with the unemployment,  the way our vets have been treated, our 20 trillion in debt, high tuition costs, giving Iran billions, giving 50% of our uranium to putin, etc. If you're happy with all those things then the choice is clear then you should vote for Hillary because you cannot blame anything on trump. He as not been in office. Hillary's hands are all over all of the decisions that have been made in the last 8 years.
23 | Sam Shappell | 2 | 1344739275622321_1344827875613461 | Johnson has my vote tired of hearing about hwo bad the other 2 candidates are. Johnson is the only one who wont be corrupted or split the country in half.

1 | Eileen Tharp | 51 | 1344680075628241_1344685465627702 | If the corrupt Obama administration will not bring Hillary to Justice than we the people MUST. Trumpsters make your voices heard loud and strong tomorrow at the ballot box
2 | Michael Marki | 42 | 1344680075628241_1344690512293864 | Never thought I would say this but James Carville was right in something he said. In an interview on Morning Joe during a discussion about corruption in Clinton Foundation, Carville said " someone's going to burn in hell over this" referring to people who said the foundation was corrupt. He was right because The Clintons and all there little corrupt minions will be burning in hell! Tell me how $2 million dollars of foundation money paid for Chelsea's wedding is charity work. Tell me how Chelsea can afford a $10 million pad in New York. This crime family makes the Mafia look like a bunch of rookies. How many stupid Americans will vote to put this corrupt family in the white House.
3 | TJ Frisk | 12 | 1344680075628241_1344703432292572 | Imagine, if you will, an FBI that would keep after Trump to expose and bring charges against him for tax evasion, fraud, sexual misconduct, voter intimidation, inciting violence against political opponents, collusion with Russia and Putin with rigging of the USA elections...etc etc.It is only then will the majority of Americans ever trust the FBI again
4 | Nick Cain | 10 | 1344680075628241_1344708378958744 | It's cute how everyone thinks this is over. They are still investigating the Clinton Foundation. The email issue with Hillary goes wayyyyyy beyond her time as Sec of State. The Clintons have woven their tentacles deep into every dark corner of the world... and there are a lot of fish left to fry. This isn't going away any time soon. :-)
5 | Deatra S Cragg | 5 | 1344680075628241_1344730942289821 | The only "facts" Republicans refer to begin with the following: It looks bad, it could be, it might be, we can assume. it is alleged, supposedly, it may be, it appears, we can only assume......well you guys get the point!   There is NOT and has NEVER been a so called, smoking gun. But let's not confuse trumpettes with real facts. It would destroy them. They do so enjoy reveling in their hatred of Hillary!
6 | Janice LeTourneau | 2 | 1344680075628241_1344722615623987 | It appears that the FBI has set a new precedent for our National Security. If you do not feel like our classified information needs to be on a secure server, It just doesn't have to be. So, the sailor who was just sent to jail will be freed since no charges should have been made. Just like Hillary. The general that was sent to prison must also be set free and not charges should have been made to begin with. Just like Hillary. The FBI has shown that people without clearance can read classified emails just as Hillary's maid did. Maybe even Snowden should be able to come back to the US and all charges dropped. We demand that all that happens to prove that Hillary hasn't been given special treatment. Our government has been turned into a sham in the past 8 years. This is nothing but corruption.
7 | Steve Lynn | 6 | 1344680075628241_1344703205625928 | If Trey Gowdy and Jason Chafftez were not using all this mess to get re-elected for the last 4 years maybe congress would have got the peoples work done instead of wasting 100 million on a lawyer witch hunt! Sometimes you need proof.
8 | Peter H Brouillard | 5 | 1344680075628241_1344707258958856 | We can fix this problem on Tuesday and in the future. Just do not vote for Hillary. If you do not like him, do not vote for Trump. Vote for the other 2 candidates or write in Bernie Sanders. After the election, change your voting status to unaffiliated. Let me ask you a question, have you ever received money back from the Republicans or the Democrats? Just over the last 2 days, I have received over 47 donation requests from both parties. Do not follow a party and make the politicians beg for your vote. The hardworking ones will get out there and show you why they need your vote. Do not be the Democratic sheep we have had in my state for all these years and see no progress. They want you to be complacent. Take charge of your families future. Show them the power you have. Make the politicians that think making money off of us is going to be easy and we will not hold them accountable to the promises they make. Let them know it will take hard work and dedication. Most of all, they will not be able to take advantage of the American People.

10 | Mindy Pye | 0 | 1344680075628241_1344838335612415 | Wow, so many people just don't get it. We now have proof that active FBI agents have been targeting a presidential candidate and releasing classified, confidential info to the other candidate in order to influence an national election. For conservatives out there - just imagine that the FBI was targeting Trump in favor of Clinton! Your heads would be exploding!
11 | Sean Allen | 4 | 1344680075628241_1344784635617785 | The Clinton corruption is astounding, even more astounding is the blind support of her uneducated followers that lack the common sense and basic intelligence to hold the criminal Hillary responsible for her actions. Its disgusting how Democrats have fully embraced pedophiles, liars, and criminals of all types now days.

Who are you guys calling yourself we the people, you must be people who want to be superior over everybody and want life to be like it  was way back when. Eileen, you guys calling yourself  we the people need to know life will not go back to the way you all want it. HILLARY supporters make your voices heard loud and strong tomorrow at the ballot box, so these so call we the people who do not include all people know they cannot win. God loves everybody and we all will answer to Him.
14 | Ken Myers | 3 | 1344680075628241_1344689572293958 | We need a cleaned out FBI. They are never allowed an opinion politically. When they become political they become the Gestapo, or the SS. The basis of our government is that there are certain pillars that can not be political. That insures the freedoms we enjoy. We need to go to sleep knowing the FBI, the Armed Forces, and it would be nice if the judicial system of lifetime appointments were above politics.
15 | Marion Rohling | 1 | 1344680075628241_1344743455621903 | THIS is what trump would call " rigged" . But hey, it's just us, the sheepish Democrats....they can be messed with, obstructed, smeared & hacked!!! We WILL RISE!
16 | Jon Persons | 0 | 1344680075628241_1344759662286949 | Podesta can go play in traffic. Coincidentally, that is what would happen if he ever became a serious threat to the Clinton powerbase.People can say that the Clintons are not corrupt because they have not been convicted of anything, but you have to remember that Al Capone was not convicted until the IRS went after him.
17 | Thea Limon | 1 | 1344680075628241_1344872795608969 | "I never heard that. I thought Vince Foster was the only person the Clinton's killed. How naive I was." After Wikileaks dropped more emails today that included this one, unknown sources shut down their website and Twitter stopped trending #DNCleaks2.
18 | Kelly Johnson | 1 | 1344680075628241_1344789108950671 | Voters are blinded by their hate of trump. Less than a week ago, FBI stated that there was no way to know the out come of 650,000 emails before the election. Days later they've made a discussion? Facts and common sense have been lost in the process. Example. 2001 bill clinton gave a pardon to international fugitive Marc Rich. This was done days after his ex wife donated to the DNC, the new clinton libary, and to the campaign of Hillary for her senator campaign. This is how the clintons operate. Congress knows it, American voters know it. And now a Clinton wants voters to give her the Oval Office again. Favors are owed to other countries for donations to her foundation which were either highly questionable or illegal. 20% of America's uranium now belongs to Russia who has rebuilt their nuclear arsenal. I ask voters why she didn't give news conferences for 250+ days then started to after the first debate. But hasn't even tried to give one since sept. 21st. Remember, making a statement and not taking questions isn't a true media conference. Stand in front of your ballot and actually think. What kind of a country votes corruption into the highest office. Don't like trump? Fine, keep your daughters and wives away from him. But with Hillary can you hide your wallet or what little savings you have?
19 | Steve Houghtaling | 0 | 1344680075628241_1344962608933321 | What matters is that America has the Constitution and the rule of law!!! If the law or Constitution is broke then their MUST be accountability to the crime by whoever commits it!!! But if some people are above the law, then we DO NOT have a Constitutional Government ruled by laws, then all we have is Tyranny!!!
20 | Peggy Gilkey | 0 | 1344680075628241_1344914102271505 | People keep talking about how many thousands of emails the FBI had to go through, excuse me if I am wrong but I thought they were only going through the ones from the time she became Secretary of State until she left. If so that cut down the emails quite a bit.
21 | Don Smith | 2 | 1344680075628241_1344720842290831 | Indeed, this should be investigated and the guilty subjects punished.But not only will you never end the leaks, this isn't about the FBI's conduct.  We wouldn't be having this conversation had Clinton not thumbed her nose at federal regulations and compromised national security.If she had any scruples she would have not made her bid for president.  But her lies and lack of shame support her egregious motives.
22 | Mike Conway | 1 | 1344680075628241_1344835238946058 | As the USA dies in front of us, helpless to do a thing because of the iron fist of corrupted power silencing what is good, moral and right.  The rule of law and the constitution.  The realization that this government is more corrupt than I already knew it to be...makes me feel and realize how helpless and hopeless we all are when confronted with this level of evil, power and corruption that is this government and that corrupt evil woman.
23 | Shane Harness | 2 | 1344680075628241_1344760212286894 | Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton “disregarded ethics guidelines” to raise more than $72 million for the U.S. Pavilion at the World’s Fair in Shanghai in 2010, taking money from big-name contributors who later “received favorable treatment” from her State Department and also contributed to her namesake foundation, according to a 2015 internal Clinton research document revealed Sunday by WikiLeaks.
24 | Jim Mouser | 1 | 1344680075628241_1344838868945695 | Yeah . the problem isn't the graft, corruption, lies and other illegal activity ... the problem is that Americans might find out about it. Liberalism is a disease.
25 | Eileen Tharp | 1 | 1344680075628241_1344727962290119 | Come on Virginians lets show the news media and the DC metropolis what the rest of the state thinks. Vote Trump. Show corrupt Terry McAuliff that we don't think it's right to buy off FBI agents. Vote Trump. Save our coal country, save our schools, save our military. Stun the Clinton news media so badly that they can't open their corrupt mouths for months.Vote Trump and check your ballots.

3 | Dixie Turner | 27 | 1344638252299090_1344747555621493 | Thinking seriously about cancelling my FB account since a person's death can draw so much hate not for the person who died but for other people. What has happened to the people in this country? You cannot blame this type of disrespect on anyone but yourselves. No political candidate can make anyone act one way or the other. That is the true personality of the ones showing the disrespect. No wonder there is so much unrest in our country. A lot of people have forgotten how to have compassion for others and have forgotten how to care for anyone other than themselves. This is not what we stand for and it certainly not what so many have fought and died for. Look at your families and ask yourself if you want this type of disrespect shown when you die?  RIP Janet Reno

6 | Christopher L Gilbert | 7 | 1344638252299090_1344670792295836 | That was then, this is now ...Janet Reno was Bill Clinton’s third pick for attorney general. He had promised to nominate a woman for the post, but his first two choices – corporate lawyer Zoe Baird and New York federal Judge Kimba Wood – withdrew following allegations they hired illegal immigrants as nannies.Today, not only would the candidate with an illegal maid not be hindered in her search for office, but the maid could handle classified documents, too!Today, our President could hire an illegal immigrant FOR Attorney General, and the press would attack anyone who questioned the legality of that.That truly was then, this really is now.
7 | Lloyd Hart | 10 | 1344638252299090_1344656368963945 | Janet Reno is the person most responsible for all the death and destruction the US has inflicted on the world in the last 16 years with it's phony "War On Terror". As US Attorney General, she didn't lift a finger to investigate the theft of election 2000 and the subsequent suborning of the US Supreme Court by the Bush Campaign because the Clintons bribed and blackmailed her off the case. Janet Reno, coward to the grave.

Tomorrow, the American voters will decide whether they wish to preserve the Republic for which so many have sacrificed so much, or relinquish their God - given freedoms to a group of self-coronated elites...a modern day monarchy.

The interviewer proposed a radical and illegal action, which the President had a duty to condemn.The President must immediately issue a statement to make crystal clear that only citizens of the United States have the right to vote, and that any noncitizen who votes, and anyone who assists noncitizens to vote, does so illegally and is subject to prosecution. The failure to clarify this statement will only add further credibility to the public’s concerns about the integrity of this election.”

Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.👁⚠️If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.👁⚠️If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.👁⚠️If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.👁⚠️If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks?

24 | Sashia E'lise Rogers | 1 | 1344638252299090_1344686352294280 | Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library.  Word for word from the Cornell Law Library  Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:"(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term "office" does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States."Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States."Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.Can you help hold Hillary accountable?
25 | Dave Barrale | 0 | 1344638252299090_1344825965613652 | WATCH: Hillary Lies To Rally, Says She Was In New York City On 9/11. https://twitter.com/charliespie.../status/793606286642409472 Hillary Clinton repeated a bald-faced lie during a campaign stop in Florida on Tuesday. The former Secretary of State told the audience that she was in New York City during the terror attacks on 9/11--a claim that has been thoroughly debunked. (This is a pure cut case of Stolen Valor.)"I know what happened not far from here at the Pulse night club in Orlando," Clinton said, referring to the Islamic terror attack on a gay nightclub that took the lives of 49 individuals in June. "I was in New York City on 9/11 as one of the two senators. I will defeat ISIS."Despite her claim, Clinton was not in New York City on 9/11, she was in Washington D.C. The former Senator from New York did not return to New York City until the following day.In September of this year, Politico reported:Clinton, meanwhile, was down in Washington, at her home on Whitehaven. She had CNN on as she talked on the phone with her legislative director when the first plane hit. Then the second. By the time she got to the Capitol, the Pentagon had been hit by a third plane.Clinton's absence on 9/11 is understandable, as congress was in session at the time. What is not understandable--or excusable--is her repeatedly claiming that she had been there. (This is a pure cut case of Stolen Valor.)This latest claim is a continuation of Clinton's pattern of unnecessarily inflating the danger she's faced in her various public roles. During her 2008 presidential run, Clinton fabricated a story about landing "under sniper fire" while visiting Bosnia as the first lady.

Let's not rest on our laurels, we must ensure that we vote blue and get our families and friends to follow suit, and vote BLUE! Vote early if possible and take an elderly or Veteran with you! What the hell do you have to lose, except a Racist Bigot?
7 | Kevin Fallon | 4 | 1344634998966082_1344727688956813 | Actually Joe, you're known as "crazy uncle Joe"- the guy who plagiarized speeches- the "gaffe master"- the guy who told a wheelchair bound mobility impaired individual to stand up......shall I continue? I would relish the opportunity to "take you out back" or behind the school or whatever vitriolic spew you directed at your opponent.
8 | Stacy Guillory | 5 | 1344634998966082_1344642388965343 | Think about this: When did the Morals of the people of The U.S.A. start going to the devil? I tell you when, when the American people said that it was ok for the President of The U.S.A. ( Bill Clinton)to have sex with an intern in the Whitehouse while on duty, when the people said it was ok for the President ( Bill Clinton) to rape a woman, to expose himself to another and to sexually assault two others. When the people said it was ok for his wife (Hillary Clinton) to send Private investigators to dig up dirt and threaten these women.   When the people Reelected Bill Clinton and Elected Hillary Clinton as senator.
9 | Janice LeTourneau | 1 | 1344634998966082_1344759918953590 | Government has proved that the Clintons are above the law. They can do anything they wish - anything - and it is okay. Pay for play, fraud, corruption or breaking our National Security laws are all okay for them to break. So, it must be okay for anyone to break the laws of our country. After all, there is no double standard that would apply to just the Clintons - is there?
10 | Thea Limon | 0 | 1344634998966082_1344872912275624 | "I never heard that. I thought Vince Foster was the only person the Clinton's killed. How naive I was." After Wikileaks dropped more emails today that included this one, unknown sources shut down their website and Twitter stopped trending #DNCleaks2.
11 | Nick Hughes | 7 | 1344634998966082_1344642512298664 | Haha msnbc and CNN going down. Breaking news on how they rigging trumps interviews and debates from both networks. I knew it but everyone thats watching them will never see it because no way will they expose themselves. And in your face to the one's putting down fox news because I was right and now you can put that in your liberal pipe and smoke it. And they are a reason for the FBI not bringing charges right now and it's a hell of a lot better the way they are going to do it. And it will also finally convince the hillary nuts she is guilty of all and even more. So good by msnbc and CNN and the entire  Clinton family along with the dnc and some of the Democrat party for it will good people from within your own party working with the Republican party  that finally takes the corruption out of our government on both sides and the corrupt main stream media. So back to fox for the real truth and the bombshells they are about to drop that everyone around the world have been waiting for this whole election and fixing to get to see it.

13 | Mike Conway | 1 | 1344634998966082_1344835475612701 | As the USA dies in front of us, helpless to do a thing because of the iron fist of corrupted power silencing what is good, moral and right.  The rule of law and the constitution.  The realization that this government is more corrupt than I already knew it to be...makes me feel and realize how helpless and hopeless we all are when confronted with this level of evil, power and corruption that is this government and that corrupt evil woman.
14 | Angela Buczkowski | 3 | 1344634998966082_1344675408962041 | Hillary is temperamentally fit! That is the very foundation of what it takes to be president. Trump has an unfortunate illness with symptoms of pathological lying, grandiosity, sexual perversion and racism! NeverTrump!

16 | Peter H Brouillard | 0 | 1344634998966082_1344708898958692 | We can fix this problem on Tuesday and in the future. Just do not vote for Hillary. If you do not like him, do not vote for Trump. Vote for the other 2 candidates or write in Bernie Sanders. After the election, change your voting status to unaffiliated. Let me ask you a question, have you ever received money back from the Republicans or the Democrats? Just over the last 2 days, I have received over 47 donation requests from both parties. Do not follow a party and make the politicians beg for your vote. The hardworking ones will get out there and show you why they need your vote. Do not be the Democratic sheep we have had in my state for all these years and see no progress. They want you to be complacent. Take charge of your families future. Show them the power you have. Make the politicians that think making money off of us is going to be easy and we will not hold them accountable to the promises they make. Let them know it will take hard work and dedication. Most of all, they will not be able to take advantage of the American People.

You don't need the FBI to make a decision just look at the emails and see the disregard for not only the law but for common voter. That is just sad that she has no respect for the American way of life or for the people she was supposed to representing. Justice at the polls and rain on the Hillary coronation and disrupt the corruption. Stand up as one voice against Hillary and the corruption of the ruling elite.
18 | Todd Dorsey | 0 | 1344634998966082_1344958758933706 | For those of you who still haven't voted yet the because you haven't had a chance or because you don't know who to vote for it's pretty simple. Are you happy with the way things have gone the last eight years are you happy with our economy, our  standing in the world , with the unemployment,  the way our vets have been treated, our 20 trillion in debt, high tuition costs, giving Iran billions, giving 50% of our uranium to putin, etc. If you're happy with all those things then the choice is clear then you should vote for Hillary because you cannot blame anything on trump. He as not been in office. Hillary's hands are all over all of the decisions that have been made in the last 8 years.

25 | Greg Griffin | 1 | 1344634998966082_1344674962295419 | People of color believe the Democratic Party represents them.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Democratic policies have bogged down their communities with failed big government policies that have hurt more than they’ve helped for half a century now.  Democrats tell folks of color what they want to hear to secure their votes.  Once that happens, they forget about them until the next election.Actually, forget is too kind a term.  They outright ignore them.  Don’t think so?  Check their record over the last 50 years.  It’s abysmal.The hallmarks of the modern Democratic Party’s election messaging strategy are:1.	All non-Democrats are racists…or worse2.	Only the government can solve your problems…you’re not smart or strong enough to make it on your own3.	The United States Constitution is irrelevant…it’s a document that contains edicts and proclamations that have  outlived their usefulnessStronger together….right?  Not even close.  It’s a straight up message of divisiveness and hate.  It’s a message that will not soon be forgotten by 10s of millions of Americans who feel as if they’ve been negatively stereotyped for simply supporting a different political viewpoint.  This isn’t a step forward…it’s a huge leap backwards.This is the very thing people of color have been struggling to stop in American politics for decades.  Not only has the modern Democratic Party propagated this approach, they have gleefully embraced it.  And they’ve insidiously done so in the most destructive, socially repugnant way imaginable.They turned us on each other for votes. Choose wisely tomorrow, People.  YOUR children and grandchildren’s future depends on it.

Hillary Clinton brought out Beyoncé, Katy Perry and Jay Z on the campaign trail, so in Michigan on Saturday, Donald Trump released the big gun of conservative celebrity endorsements.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jon Altbergs | 1363 | 1344590818970500_1344593122303603 | Wasn't Trump calling HRC disgusting for her links to "pedophile" Anthony Weiner, yet here he is on stage with pedophile Ted Nugent.
2 | Steph Bynum | 1266 | 1344590818970500_1344593278970254 | Didn't Trump say Hillary having "celebrities" at rallies was a sign of weakness? Me thinks he's upset because he can't get better celebrities. What a sad, jealous little man.
3 | Dama Arauz | 464 | 1344590818970500_1344594892303426 | While Trump was denying people of color apartments Hillary straight out of college worked in the south to desegregate the schools and was a lawyer for disabled children to have the right to attend schools. If your child is on the SCHIP program that provides heath care to millions of children you have Hillary Clinton to thank for that. Hillary is the logical choice.
4 | Rich Wilfong | 320 | 1344590818970500_1344596092303306 | Draft avoiders stick together. Ted Nugent is an offense to everyone. He is just a has been dirt bag trying to hang on to any past relevance he once had. He is pathetic, sociopathic and not worth the time to consider his opinion.
5 | Jennifer Veros | 391 | 1344590818970500_1344592475637001 | Oh yea. This guy totally shuts down a Beyoncé and JayZ appearance and performance. ::sarcasm::
6 | Anthony Canty | 241 | 1344590818970500_1344600688969513 | Nugent, a pants-shitting draft dodger campaigning for Trump, a draft dodger who complained of bone spurs when it was his turn to pick-up a rifle and lead a patrol in Vietnam.
7 | Virginia McCoy | 219 | 1344590818970500_1344610788968503 | He can have Chachi and Nutty Nugent. I'll take Stevie Wonder,Lady Gaga, LeBron James, Katy Perry, Michelle Obama, Oprah, Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, Natalie Maines. ..... and the list goes on. #itsover. #strongertogether!
8 | Tommy Ivors | 199 | 1344590818970500_1344597118969870 | So, this animal killing big mouth scumbag is the best Trump could do? Nugent proudly announced that he was going deer hunting right after his crotch grabbing appearance. Such low class ..
9 | Janay King | 147 | 1344590818970500_1344593768970205 | As we run into this final stretch in the 2016 vote, I wanted to make a post that helps to keep people on target since this is such an important election. Let’s think about the recent Brexit vote that is forcing the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, for a moment. In that vote, people made a protest vote against staying in the Union because they didn’t think that it would really happen. The Result, many Millennial Voters desperately want to take their vote back, saying that they were not being serious. In the 1980’s Carter was up by 8 points in the polls, people did not come out to vote because they thought that he had it beat. In the 2000 election, people were not thrilled about Al Gore, thinking that he was too much of a bore, and not a strong candidate. Many Liberals voted for Ralph Nader instead of Al Gore, and handed George Bush Jr. a razor thin victory that resulted in a disastrous 8 years. Listen People, I understand that it really looks like Hillary has this all sewn up. Trust me when I say that she doesn’t. It is not over until the last vote is counted.  She may not be your candidate that you are willing to stand on railroad tracks to get elected, she may not be your perfect choice for President, BUTIf history tells us anything, it is that we should never take anything for granted. This election needs to be won by Hillary Clinton. It is not enough to say that Hillary Needs to be President, but that she needs to win by such a huge margin so we never have to see Trump, or anyone like Trump, on the ballot ever again. We need to retake Congress. We need to vote blue for all Congressmen and Senators so we can retake the House and Senate. We need to put a stop to this crazy Republican right wing insanity that has gripped our government for years because of blind racism and stupidity. Get out there, Vote, get your Friends and Family to vote. Stop the insanity!!!!
10 | John J. McGrath | 89 | 1344590818970500_1344603505635898 | Don't think this endorsement's gonna pull in independents, Hispanics and women. It's more likely to drive those groups to ABT! I think he's already got the white, deer hunter vote.

12 | Sheila Harris | 41 | 1344590818970500_556200904586375 | The air is hanging very heavy here in Michigan this morning....the presence of Trump and Nugent in one space has damaged our ozone layer and dropped IQs if you were in proximity of the two....please call hazmat.
13 | Alan R. Ausel | 42 | 1344590818970500_1344606135635635 | Ted the head of Capons of America likes to kill things that can't shoot back. He was a bit reluctant to shoot at the Viet Cong.
14 | James Anderson | 60 | 1344590818970500_1344612812301634 | Isn't this the same guy who said he was going to leave the country if Obama was elected... and then said he would commit suicide if he was re-elected? So obviously, he's just as honest as Trump is.
15 | Karen Falch | 47 | 1344590818970500_1344593615636887 | You left out James Taylor and Stevie Wonder. Trump called it cheating. Someone tell him respect is earned.
16 | Norman Doll | 29 | 1344590818970500_1344613748968207 | Lmao This is too priceless in so many ways. What a way to end this election season.June Trump says "we'll have all the biggest stars"August through November everyone from LeBron James and Beyonce to Springsteen and Bon Jovi appear with and for ClintonSame time period Trump gets Scott Baio and NugentTrump complains about foul mouthed Jay Z. Brings in foul mouthed Nugent. You can't make this stuff up. Lori Price Doll
17 | Michael Howard | 29 | 1344590818970500_1344622235634025 | Trump is the poster boy for hypocrisy and Kellyanne Conway a Clinton hater from way back is the poster girl for hypocrisy. Trump is angry that people from all walks of life is coming to the stage to support Hillary Clinton. The Republican Politicians refused be seen on stage with Trump. And, Trump has to accept support from far right groups ( KKK, White Christian Americans and other hate groups) and people that's not accepted by the Republican party. Go Hillary clean this moron's clock and his spinning surrogates.
18 | Latasha Wroten | 30 | 1344590818970500_1344617815634467 | Reading thru the comments...why does Trump and his idiotic supporters think all black Americans live in the inner city? Misinformed blind leading the blind. I say again If America elects the Orange Shag Rug were all going to hell with gasoline drawz on and Trump will have the nuclear codes to execute it.
19 | Steven Eash-Sanford | 12 | 1344590818970500_1183281961752466 | Oh please, this dried up old has been.......maybe he should have Chichi along side them.....then we can talk about a powerhouse......blow hards and bullies......FYI.....Grew up near Ted and my sister knows him......I am originally from Hanover Michigan when Ted lived on Ludtington Road......some people just need to sit back and retire, play bridge and watch reruns of hee haw
20 | Ronald Shackelford | 29 | 1344590818970500_1344595068970075 | By having Ted Nugent join him, what was Trump trying to prove, that being a child rapist for stars is ok?
21 | Raymond Patitucci | 27 | 1344590818970500_1344617108967871 | Nugent like trump sexually molested women so they make a good pair. Both are examples of the worst of male hood from the USA. They are both archaic and a throw back to an earlier type of male. Distgusting.

24 | Jim Manns | 8 | 1344590818970500_1676919099213370 | The same woman that dresses provocative and promoted the "Black Patherns" at family half time show of a National Televised event, "the Super Bowl". Beyonce is polluting our youth. And Hilary is lying and killing our men and woman in uniform, the two worse  role models of the year.

Aware that she could be declared the president-elect in about 48 hours, Clinton seemed to get a head start on the national group therapy session.

Her tone is entirely right, and I am most assuredly with her. 💟
5 | John Erwin Steiger | 53 | 1344391795657069_1344393982323517 | All mainstream media has submitted their "Hillary Wins" article for Tuesday night to the Clinton campaign so they begin their new "mandate speech". It's all fixed, it's all corrupt, prepare for war in america.
6 | Jason Eades | 54 | 1344391795657069_1344392725656976 | It took FBI Director Comey's team 1.3 years to review 55,000 Clinton emails. They just took 9 days to clear through 650,000? The system is RIGGED folks. This is your last chance to get your country back. #TRUMP2016
7 | Bry Russell | 21 | 1344391795657069_1344402132322702 | Perhaps we can tranq Trumpsters and relocate them to an abandoned island where they can grunt, pick each other's fur, posture, thump chests, fight, scream and screech, cry foul and treachery, screw, drink, drug, reproduce, and not read or think critically together on Trump Island, patent pending!? I know, so very mean, being mean to those who are hateful and racist, who haven't evolved yet...

9 | Paula Snyder | 11 | 1344391795657069_1344409585655290 | If you haven't voted yet...or still undecided, and you or a person is coming of social security age try and find the Trump policy to keep it solvent pass the year 2034. Hillary has a plan that will require a collective effort but it is a fix for sustainability. Isn't that the person you want as your president?
10 | Tao Valentine | 2 | 1344391795657069_1104818786300447 | Logically I know this post is unlikely to change anyone's mind about this election, and that's okay because I believe in the democratic process. I suppose I'm writing this as much for me as I am in the hope that someone will read it and question the legacy they want to leave the next generation. For what feels like forever, I have been listening to, and watching, Trump: attack racial, gender and sexual equality; use violent rhetoric and hate speech; support white supremacists; make fun of people with disabilities; attack our veterans; boast about how wealth and fame offer him access to our bodies, with or without consent; challenge our democracy; talk about torturing and killing innocent people; and lie without remorse or recourse to the American people. I have had a particularly visceral response to him boasting about sexually assaulting women after popping a Tic Tac, and then watching 12 women bravely come forward to confront their attacker, only to be dismissed, threatened and ridiculed on the public stage. I cannot express how courageous I think these women are. It is much easier to stuff down the emotions that accompany being violated than it is to stand up and fight. It's easier to swallow the anger and wash it down with food, alcohol or drugs. I understand this intimately. We wonder as a country why so many young college men don't understand that when a woman says no, she means exactly that. We shake our heads when they are taken to court by their victims, slapped on the hand, and sent back to their communities to violate more women. If we want to understand why our country has become one that embraces rape culture, we don't have to look far; it's all around us. The Republican party has endorsed a man who embodies the dying breed of racist, misogynist white men who believe women are second class citizens, put here to satisfy their sexual desires. We have a responsibility to ourselves, our sons and daughters, our sisters and mothers, and our country's unwritten history, to stop this rebirth of our nation's hatred and inequality. Voting in this election is perhaps the most patriotic thing we can do at this moment in time. If the choice is between moving forward together, or moving backward divided, there really is no choice.
11 | Bert McCollum | 5 | 1344391795657069_1344624475633801 | Hillary, who WILL win tomorrow, recognizes that her number one priority will be to bring healing to our bitterly divided country- a far different priority than we would have seen from Donald Trump.
12 | Robert Crouch | 1 | 1344391795657069_1344662958963286 | What does it matter that we have laws,can prove instances of Federal voter fraud,etc if the Administration's Justice Department refuses to prosecute and indeed actively blocks attempts at prosecution. Sad times for America,
13 | Crystal Elston Davis | 3 | 1344391795657069_1104984339617225 | You Trump people are delusional. Trump is a danger to this country. He is interested in making money not treating the American with respect. He has no decency and you all are accusing Hillary of the same things he is doing and done. He talks filthy and does not respect women. You certainly must only watch Fox News and don't learn any facts. What a shame these insults and lies are out here. The email trash is over.
14 | Gayle Murrain | 6 | 1344391795657069_1344539638975618 | One thing that I love about people "You, talk on hear say".  Stop reading and listening to right wing BS If you want facts ask yourself the following..1) Why has the GOP, denied raising taxes or redoing the taxes on the top 2% since Regan?..2)Why have they gerrymander, voting districts across this country for the past 25 years?3)Why have the republican states denied you medical insurance?4)Why have the GOP, voted against raising  wages for every American? But raise their own???5) Why did they allow major companies to take their money and business out of the country over the past 25 years or more?Just a few simple little questions????Ask yourself why is it that when your make making more than 300k, the more loop holes you have????Shouldn't those who make less pay less and have more loop holes?????If you want change and fairness vote "DEMOCRAT"...
15 | Andrew Riley | 2 | 1344391795657069_1344417712321144 | Get it straight, when she wins from now till she's out of office it'll be 'impeach Hillary!' all day everyday. Hell I'm betting the memes have already started. Straight goods, in 2036 Chelsea/Malia will face the same ol' same.
16 | Joseph Szarwark | 3 | 1344391795657069_1344644322298483 | LOL! FBI review over, no charges. Can we finally admit some Republicans don't know what the hell they're talking about. So wrong so many times. That kind of a track record usually eliminates all credibility.
17 | Ryan Calabrese | 2 | 1344391795657069_1344672985628950 | I'm just sad I'm going to have to look at that face, and hear that witchy voice, for the next 4 years. I'll have to shut off the TV anytime she is on, and truly no longer care about anything that goes on in American politics, just so I don't have to see that face, or hear that banshee yell
18 | Andrew Buck | 5 | 1344391795657069_1344434222319493 | Hillary takes tens of millions from middle eastern countries that kill/beat women and gays by government decree, not to mention her foundation robbed Haiti of hundreds of millions after the earthquake which resulted in thousands of poor black Haitians dying!

As Secretary of State she was extremely careless with national security on emails that were bleached from a private server. It's akin to the murderer who everyone knows did it, but the gun can't be found. "Sir, without physical evidence of the murder weapon, you're free to go".
22 | Christina Tetlow | 3 | 1344391795657069_1344510538978528 | Hey Morning Joe, I seem to remember back after the 2012 election, you chastised the Republican party for ignorring the Hispanic vote. Well, guess what, they didn't listen. Are you seeing the numbers yesterday of Hispanic voters, showing up to vote. I have a problem with poll numbers. This is crystal ball or Palm reader theories. Watch what happens tomorrow and then tell me I am wrong. I love you and Mika, but was sick of this email crap. I was suspicious at the start and your Ignorance of Giuliani bagging about a Big surprise, days before Comey's letter. There was a big stink going on. And you ignore the Breitbart effect in Trump's campaign. There are certainly a lot of major culprits in that group. Oh and isn't that book a red flag for the FBI?  Breitbart supporter wrote it, right?  Media do your job!  Then you ignore the many lawsuits that Trump is facing, and not just the harassment suits. I am SICK of the emails. Move on.
23 | Joey Balz | 1 | 1344391795657069_1104907199624939 | Lol bridge building!! She's hated by sane people. She's pandered to blacks Muslims and illegals. She's called all white peoples racist. No bridges to be built here. If she wins. She will merely start her illegal activity unchecked. It's what she does. Lie, cheat, steal
24 | Scott Nadell | 1 | 1344391795657069_1344551245641124 | Tensions spike because this country has a huge problem. It's no different than it was on the eve of the Civil War. Deeply divided. Back in 1860 it was about Slavery. Cheap labor for Southern plantation owners. Operate a business by owning human beings.Today, it's still about Southern society, cheap manufacturing jobs lost to the Far East, the landscape of America changing not to the liking of White Caucasians, race, and naturally the interpretation of Christian Family values.Just look at a map. A nation deeply divided. We might not have a traditional Civil War with guns, but we now fight by allowing our Federal Government to fall into disarray. Republicans now use Obstruction vs Compromise. Republicans  try to alter voter suppression  of minorities. American people love to complain. Half don't vote, apathy. The other half keep voting the same Losers back into office.So now we have a nation where half of us want to move forward and keep evolving and half want to go backwards. Go back to when Whites had the power and life was country simple.If history tells you anything, you can't go backwards or stay the same. You can only move forward.America will vote on Tuesday and the judgment of the American people will certainly be challenged.
25 | Everett Clifford | 2 | 1344391795657069_1344495722313343 | She was involved with voting fraud against Bernie Sanders, along with the Democratic party and Deb Schultz, that is just one of her many many atrocities that she has committed, if the American people are so ignorant to vote for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump , You get what you deserve,

Trump sounded a familiar refrain after learning the latest from the FBI: The system's rigged.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lise Melin | 505 | 1344313052331610_1344315085664740 | Hillary said it the day Comey unlawfully injected himself in the election: There's nothing there. She's pretty much been saying the same thing for 30 years, and Republicans have fished once again without success!DON'T BOO, VOTE!
2 | Maryjo Hetro | 319 | 1344313052331610_1344315935664655 | Just go away...we are tired of your comments...when he thinks he is winning everything is fine...when he thinks he is losing the system is rigged...can you imagine this nut case running this country....he is one big joke!!!
3 | Chris Finch | 200 | 1344313052331610_1344314478998134 | Lol....pathetic.The good thing though, is no one is left that can't see though his ridiculousness....Other than the deplorables, and they don't count.
4 | Frank Ramirez | 103 | 1344313052331610_1344317145664534 | He has nothing, that's what happened, he's angry and pissed that Giuliani wasn't able to win the game for him. You see, Trump is a coward, he operates in the shadows and has no backbone, Giuliani was his go to. It didn't work out too well
5 | Deda Richardson | 72 | 1344313052331610_1344316752331240 | He is a psychological nightmare. He has such bizarre control over people who are running from false information. People don't research enough to know that she's not the first to be involved in loss of life for our Country and she will not be the last. These people sign on knowing that they could lose their lives. He should be a hypnotist instead!
6 | Kerry Senchyna | 93 | 1344313052331610_1344321818997400 | Don't let up Dems. No matter what the polls show. Don't get complacent. Show this combination of Homer Simpson and Adolf Hitler that there is a blue tidal wave about to crash down on him.
7 | Ceil Sheehan | 70 | 1344313052331610_1344324708997111 | I could accept their logic if one person was reading and deciphering 650,000 emails. However, the FBI has thousands of researchers, sophisticated computer programs and programmers. I'm surprised it took 8 days. Trumpites get ready for a downfall come Tuesday night!🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙
8 | Adam Buky | 63 | 1344313052331610_1344322422330673 | He was cheering the FBI on when they wanted to review the new emails which were mostly duplicate and now that he doesn't like the results... it's all of a sudden rigged again.
9 | Nelly Bernice | 58 | 1344313052331610_1344321272330788 | Sick and tired of this freaking bastard😤 when things don't go his way everything is rigged👊🏼  just 1 more day and hopefully we won't see him again#hillaryforpresident #imwithher
10 | Amy Yavelak-Czyz | 26 | 1344313052331610_1344335292329386 | Unfit for president. Does not accept conclusions that do not support false narrative and right wing conspiracy theories. To suggest a rigged system devoid of fact, ignoring the five year character assassination anti Clinton witch hunt, is unfathomable. Trump is a disgraceful buffoon. Clinton has not been granted due process and her constitutional right to innocence until proven guilty by the GOP, GOP congress, trump and conservatives. Don't tell us how you love the constitution and continue to crucify her character, you're all full of crap.
11 | Sam T. Abraham | 28 | 1344313052331610_1344326085663640 | He's like a five-year-old child. He doesn't accept anything that doesn't go his way. He pouts and whines and thinks life isn't fair if he doesn't always get his way. The man is pathetic.
12 | Anu Banu | 34 | 1344313052331610_1344318042331111 | The world is watching us. Let us create history now and elect Madam President. So much is at stake. Please go out and vote for Hillary Clinton on Nov 8th. The other candidate is a mad devil running loose. Don't be complacent. Every single vote is significant.
13 | Devin Smith | 22 | 1344313052331610_1344323278997254 | The irony is that HRC is accused of secret collusion with people in and out of government including foriegn governments.  Yet upon closer inspection it is Trump that has always and continues to have secret collusion with people in and out of government including foriegn governments.  And he knows his tax returns would show it.  As much heat as he takes he has correctly calculated that he can remain shrouded in secrets ranting about the tiny amount that is not known about HRC.  And people are falling for it!
14 | Annette Kessee | 6 | 1344313052331610_1344463592316556 | Dems, we've gotta show up in huuuuge numbers because there's no telling how many votes Hillary lost behind that bs FBI investigation. People were early voting for 9 days before this idiot came out with the news yesterday about the emails not revealing anything new.He should resign immediately! We must stay the course, stand in line for as long as it takes, and vote BLUE.
15 | Lynda Klem | 7 | 1344313052331610_1344334928996089 | I am so sick of hearing this is rigged, that is rigged.....If people don't like the outcome to something they deal the 'rigged' card.  And in some cases there's a bit of paranoia mixed in,
16 | M E MBeth Elliott | 16 | 1344313052331610_1344337678995814 | Trump needs to worry more about what has come out about him, and his wife Melania. He bribed a public official, stole money from a charity, tax evasion,ties with Russia, illegally doing business with Cuba, and his wife has immigration problems. I'm sure there's some I missed, or haven't leaked out yet.
17 | Paul Dombrowski | 18 | 1344313052331610_1344327398996842 | So, just last week the King of wussies was praising Comey, and today the crybaby whines about it? Hey righties, how come your orange fuhrer goes through so many mood swings?   Is it drugs or menopause?
18 | Kerry Senchyna | 11 | 1344313052331610_1344378572325058 | If the media is rigged mr. drumpf, then why did many hard right conservative newspapers who have always endorsed the republican candidate for almost 100 years did NOT endorse you? New Hampshire Union Leader, Arizona Republic, The Dallas Morning News, Cincinnati Enquirer, Detroit News. Are they all in on the massive global conspiracy to keep you out of the White House? Or are they so disgusted with you as a human being that they can't bring themselves to endorse you? Only someone with as toxic and vile views about the world would cause them to do this, not a massive conspiracy. You sir are delusional.
19 | Jason Miller | 4 | 1344313052331610_1344322665663982 | Everyone that isn't voting for Hillary doubts it. And they should. She should have been indicted. Plain and simple. Anyone else would and has been indicted for what she did. The DOJ blocked this. Period. Some has their boot on comey's neck. 650k emails in 8 days???? Hahahaha there litterally isn't enough time in the day to read each one.

21 | Francis Antobre | 6 | 1344313052331610_1344367385659510 | Right wings have a disease called  deplorable. They believe stupid conspiracies. How will any sane person support Trump? The guy is liberal to the core, oh I forgot he said Republicans are the most stupid. They will believe anything.

23 | Roofus Ray | 4 | 1344313052331610_1344319352330980 | You ppl don't hear to good. Did Comey say . The yr long Clinton foundation investigation is still ongoing ? The IRS is still investigating her also..no you didnt. But they are and that had nothing to do with Trump or deplorables.
24 | Chloe James | 12 | 1344313052331610_1344313818998200 | She's still under a separate criminal investigation by the FBI for her pay to play scandals. And they haven't yet begun the investigation for perjury, which we all know she's guilty of! I'm so over this woman!
25 | Emmit Penny | 0 | 1344313052331610_1344453088984273 | I can't wait till November 9th when Trump refuses to pay everyone and sues the lot for his loss. The FBI still maintains that there has been no wrong doing on the part of Sectary Clinton. The FBI says they still won't be filing charges. Of course Hillary rigged the whole thing!!! 😊😊😊

There is going to be a winner, either Trump or Hillary! Deal with that reality! Do you want to live in a country lead by a buffoon like Trump, or do you want someone with a proven record of public service and worldwide respect! Stop being spoiled, sore losers and THINK! Vote! Go Hillary! Go Democrats across the country!!
2 | Joe Marsilio | 54 | 1344282502334665_1344292482333667 | Vote swapping should be illegal. Voting on behalf of another person, not to mention if they don't reside in the jurisdiction where the vote takes place, is illegal.
3 | Patricia Marie Diienno | 31 | 1344282502334665_1344290379000544 | Stein will never win, but worse yet, if Trump wins, Stein will be hated & branded.  On that account alone, I would never vote for someone that stupid. Imagine how badly they could screw up everything else in the country.

6 | Jason Rayborn | 1 | 1344282502334665_1344452655650983 | Hillary's father, Hugh Rodham, Sr., was reportedly a "fixer" and "bagman" for banks and insurance companies, here and overseas. Her brothers have reportedly aligned themselves with business in the former Soviet Union, described by some as with the criminal oligarchs of the Russian mafiya and their laundry banks. In the Clinton administration, there was no effective scrutiny or restraint of the Russian criminals operating in U.S. big cities, like Chicago, Cleveland, and New York. America's secret political police, the FBI, the CIA, and the DEA, have been willfully blind. With impunity, dope from Southwest Red China floods into the U.S. through Chicago as a major intake point. According to law enforcement personnel, the Rodhams reportedly stem from links to the Gambino crime family in Scranton, Pennsylvania
7 | Militari Vernado | 14 | 1344282502334665_1344282609001321 | Hillary is a terrible candidate, but Trump lack the intellectual capacity. I wonder if the conservatives would have given a free pass to a person of color with a low vocabulary like Trump does. Trump is not a well spoken candidate and his vocabulary is limited. That's why he uses word like wall all the time  lol

16 | Francis DiCarlo | 3 | 1344282502334665_1344367078992874 | REASONS TO NOT VOTE HILLARY⚠️If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?👁⚠️If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.👁⚠️If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.👁⚠️If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.👁⚠️If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.👁⚠️If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.👁⚠️If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?👁⚠️If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? 👁
17 | Lara Ann Notes | 3 | 1344282502334665_1344290992333816 | If the Dems need an app to do this that just tells you Clinton doesn't have a compelling argument of her own. All she has is her gender and she needs tricks to fool people into voting for her. Unfortunately, there are plenty fools out there to do so.
18 | Hannah Gibbs | 0 | 1344282502334665_1344627822300133 | The reason I don't like this idea is it will be used for evil for Trump supporters. They can easily claim to be a third party voter and "swap" with a Hillary Clinton voter and still go vote for Trump knowing they tricked a Hillary Clinton supporter into not voting for her. I'm not comfortable with this AT ALL.

21 | Teresa Cooper | 0 | 1344282502334665_1344729172289998 | Before you vote tomorrow remember this, 51 million babies have been aborted in the U.S.since Rowe vs Wade decision. Hillary supports Partial Birth Abortion even when full term. They will advance their cause on this. At any term this is still a baby. And on any day of the week it is still abortion more - correctly described... murder of innocents. Think about the murder of thesebabies before you cast your vote.  Also remember for those of you who carry a gun, if you vote for Hillary, you will have your guns taken away. It's not just scare tactics, it is a fact. And this country will sympathize Muslims, and persecute Christians. You are not voting in the first woman President, you are voting in a demon.

Vermont, Wyoming, Oregon, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Iowa, Delaware, and Alabama, write in Bernie too. Everybody else, your job is to vote third party so we can be rid of Trump/Clinton and kick this thing to the US House. The goal, keep Trump and Clinton out of the top three. Oh and big thanks to Utah for leading the way and going third party, neither Clinton nor Trump will reach 270. Lets try to keep them out of the top three America!

In the ad, Trump says he will defend Americans against "those who control the levers of power in Washington" and pledges to fight the "global power structure" and its promotion of "global special interests."

1 | Craig Williams | 218 | 1344222529007329_1344234202339495 | trump says he will defend americans from those who control the levers of power in washington, hmmmmm, republicans control the congress and the senate and have obstructed the president on everything he tries to do, so it would seem that trump wants to protect us from republicans, how can he do that when he is in the party that is the problem?

What is disturbing is that we live in a country where even one single person, never mind millions, believe a brainless, racist, egomaniacal sexual predator with the temperament of a middle school bully deserves your precious vote. We're at a point where if you vote for Trump you either endorse what he represents (I almost said "stands for" but he stands for NOTHING other than his insatiable narcissism) or you are ignorant of it. Which is it? I really want a Trump voter to tell me.
6 | Carrie Lalonde | 26 | 1344222529007329_1344284572334458 | I am an 89 year old Democrat and voted for Hillary via mail in ballot. I Think the Democrats should make it known that the voters can change their votes (as Trump did) now that Hilary has been absolved of any wrong doing. That hurt her I know. I watched the dinner party after the conventions and I thought Trump looked more like Melania's Father than her Husband. I think Trump is ugly both inside and out. Just saying!!!

Just like Hitler, he studied Hitlers speeches and agenda for years. The professional con man scares the living daylights out of me. The ultimate quest is for power over the US. Will that include the whole earth?

12 | Craig Williams | 10 | 1344222529007329_1344257859003796 | trump is a traitor who goes on russian tv to trash his own govt. and military, encourages a foreign govt. to hack an american official ( conspiracy to commit espionage ) tries to do business with cuba during the embargo, brags that paying no taxes makes him smart, taxes he avoids which support and pay our soldiers, first responders, firemen and police he pretends to care about, loses a billion dollars in one year ( imagine what he would do to the economy) makes a casino go broke - how does that happen, a casino is suppose to have the advantage, his companies are based overseas to avoid american taxes, he buys materials from other countries to assemble his products in his overseas companies, he uses chinese steel, instead of american made steel, to build his buildings, he does not employ american workers in those companies, how can he make america great again when even HE won't invest in america?
13 | Laurie Lee | 6 | 1344222529007329_1344282692334646 | It is important that Donald Trump and the obstructionist, vindictive, necrophobic members of Congress are repudiated during this election, because we need to send a clear message that AMERICA DOES NOT STAND FOR BIGOTRY AND HATE.
14 | Keith Keybaby Lewis | 6 | 1344222529007329_1344280865668162 | And again her enemies investigated her and found nothing If the republicans have taught me anything, it's that Hillary is the most honest person to ever run for president. They have investigated her since 1992 at a taxpayer expense in the 100s of millions of dollars and found that she did nothing wrong.How many of her enemies could survive this and still run for president

18 | Patricia O. DeTreville | 2 | 1344222529007329_1344286289000953 | This could not possibly be UNintentional. Surely there is SOMEONE in the Trump campaign who knows something about history. One can hope. However, since this is a subtle and continuing them, it appears to be intending to appeal to the basest instincts, just as Trump has done all along.
19 | Anthony Byrd | 2 | 1344222529007329_1344304232332492 | This is the same bull that has been twisted over and over again. If Trump states someone is not doing a good job then race, gender, religion, and everything else gets brought into mix. Maybe the person just sucks at doing their job regardless of the other things. Oh no that's right we live in a PC world where no one is going to be accountable. It's someone else's fault or someone kept me down because of this, that, or the other.

22 | Michael Howard | 1 | 1344222529007329_1344642092298706 | Trump is playing to his hate groups and racists people that are supporting him with their money and time. Groups such as White Christian Americans, White Nationalist, KKK, Neo-Nazis, White supremacist, Alt-Right, Ex-Yahweh cult members and many others. Their racism combined with Trump racism make one big mess. We Americans must vote on Nov 8 and put a stop to this type of racist campaigning. Send a message this is not what America is about.

LETS WORK TOGETHER TO ELECT ONE OF THE MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATES EVER TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT! In just 1 DAY. 4 HOURS, voting will begin to elect our next president and candidates up and down the ballot When I say this race is close, that is an understatement. DONALD TRUMP could really win. Folks, EVERYTHING we have been fighting for these last 8 years (and before) is at stake: women's rights, equal pay, environmental protections, college affordability, immigration reform, tax reform, you name it. If you have been sitting on the sidelines or are apprehensive about supporting Hillary because she has her flaws, I urge you to consider getting out and voting for her. Take a step back from the sensationalism and look at her platform. Look at what she is aiming to do as president compared to Trump. Look at the tremendous work she has done for children and families throughout her career. This election is too consequential to sit out and we NEED YOU in order to win. After the election is over, we can work to push for a more progressive agenda but, if we sit back and let Trump win, any hope of that goes out the window...literally. If anyone wants to talk/has questions PLEASE feel free to reach out to me this weekend. Your vote is your voice. Make it heard on November 8th by casting a ballot for the most progressive, qualified candidate on the ballot.

He is so much more intelligent sounding, knowledgeable and credible as a presidential candidate than dingbat Gary Johnson. I have given a great deal respect to him. But I dont have much for GJ,.. the guy just comes off too whacky and NOT presidential material. The Libertarian party might have gained more respectability if he (Bill Weld) were the top of the ticket. I wish him well.
6 | Kim Banez | 82 | 10154060865969067_10154066051754067 | Ever notice how people who have directly worked with Clinton on both sides of the aisle, worked with her in business, in intelligence, in the military, all have good things to say about her?

7 | George Faust | 35 | 10154060865969067_10154066015174067 | They should've had Weld at the top of the ticket, he just seems much more rational than Johnson, I know he's been a lifelong republican, but she could probably use someone like him in her cabinet

12 | Angus Ramadeen | 6 | 10154060865969067_10154066302269067 | Hillary Clinton is an honest but she is not perfect because she is human. She is worthy of being out president because amongst the two candidate she is the best prepared. Mr. Trump does not have the experience or temperament for world affairs we cannot afford to take a chance in todays world we need a strong steady leader. Go Hillary! The republicans have spent 100's of millions of dollars trying to destroy Mrs. Clinton so obviously some of it has stuck.

They worked for the working people and really cared. Now all they care about is themselves. The Republican party has changed to become the party of the working people. We are tired of seeing all the corruption that is going on in the administration of Obama. The Wikileaks emails and the FBI emails, has open many people eyes as to what is really going on.  Vote Trump for God and Country!!!!

She says he was, and still is her mentor.👁⚠️If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.👁⚠️If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.👁⚠️If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.👁⚠️If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?👁⚠️If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? 👁

With just days to go until Election Day, the list of prominent Republicans — elected officials, former officials, former cabinet members, foreign policy experts, donors and commentators — who say they will not support their party's nominee continues to grow.

1 | Krystal Perez | 329 | 1344131675683081_1344133435682905 | PERFECTION! haha. Plain & simple: We cannot let a racist, sexist, trash-talking, pathetic, inhumane Republican be the face and voice of our country.
2 | Kara Kiblinger | 224 | 1344131675683081_1344133112349604 | Wait til 2020, when all the Republicans running for President will try to distance themselves from Trump. Almost none of them can claim they didn't support him at one point or another.
3 | Man-El Garcia | 207 | 1344131675683081_1344132455683003 | I stopped replying to the trump supporters. I almost feel sorry for them, almost ...
4 | Francisco Galdamez | 112 | 1344131675683081_1344133989016183 | Donald Trump is a scumbag at its finest in quality. Lets be realistic here people. Donald talks about our economy . How jobs are flying overseas!well last time I checked he is one of  the types of business men he is describing .He has lots of businesses out of the U.S of A. To avoid taxes .He talks about how the system walks all over the little guy but wait a minute, he does step all over the little guy by sueing and pumping fear into contractors that try to collect the full amount of money for their honest hard work they provided.He talks about law and order. How can trump supporters block in their minds  all the sexual assualts that Donald trump has done in his lifetime? More than just one is true, thats all it takesTo know that this man should be in jail and registered as a SEX OFFENDER not registered as a PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE! A poor man gets accused he is jailed until proven innocent. A rich man gets accused he roaming free and is thought to be above the law!#NEVERTRUMP2016

You got nothing on her now. She is a good person and will be your next president. Trump is a hateful, racist, arrogant, person and will never be our president. Americans want someone that represent our values. Trump does not live up to those values.

10 | Carlene Salvaggio | 26 | 1344131675683081_1344140212348894 | A great list of people Republican people however blue all the way for me only because Republicans want to keep their seats in the House and we need Democrats in the house in Congress to get things done with a Democratic president
11 | Keith Keybaby Lewis | 22 | 1344131675683081_1344151842347731 | And again her enemies investigated her and found nothing If the republicans have taught me anything, it's that Hillary is the most honest person to ever run for president. They have investigated her since 1992 at a taxpayer expense in the 100s of millions of dollars and found that she did nothing wrong.How many of her enemies could survive this and still run for president
12 | MJ Rich-Schmerberg | 18 | 1344131675683081_1344140342348881 | I don't care about who in the party is infighting. I'm more concerned about the people voting for him going  berserk if he doesn't win .....or going berserk if he does win. I thought Iowans were nice people. They didn't look so nice at his rallies. Neither do any of the wonderful Christian people at any of his meetings look nice or decent or the least bit fair minded.....  not if they think they can IMPOSE their religious beliefs on the rest of  us if he wins, and more frightening, him carrying out the multitude of threats he's made. The chants of "lock her up" alone were too close to the sounds made at a witch hunt. These people are complicit in that if they vote for him.

Now a qualified woman is about to be the first female commander in chief and my daughter, mother, sisters, friends, etc couldn't be happier! #Unity4Peace💙

18 | Belinda Carver | 13 | 1344131675683081_1344142015682047 | This is the exact reason I'm voting Trump.  If the corrupt elite establishment in the Republican party aren't supporting him, then he's the man we need.  If they were behind him 100%, then it would be because he was bought just as they are.
19 | Marcus Napolian Smith | 19 | 1344131675683081_1344138789015703 | Trump is about to end up like Romney did back in November 2012 before the election.Wasting fuel traveling all over the country with no hope of winning and no support of major republicans.

And the only people that need to fear Trump as President are self-serving Politicians and Media spinners that won't get their backs scratched anymore.
22 | Kester Edward Lowers Jr | 1 | 1344131675683081_1847334162177868 | The republican party may not voice they are like Trump but they are in every way as every legislation and law shows racism and division of classed is created by them. The schools educational system is failing due to their ideas of schools being divided by class , and race. Wars to support another power player besides oil corporations is the weapons manufacturers . They just don't say it. They put it into law.

He, as FBI can do nothing on his end but Congress can now proceed with lying under oath and destroying evidence after Congressional Subpoena issued. Congress will go after her as they did Nixon.
24 | Michael French | 3 | 1344131675683081_1344153885680860 | it use to upset me reading people did not consider Obama as their president because they did not vote for him i never felt that way about any president but i do feel that way about hillary- i was never given s chance to vote i feel- so no if she is given the presidency she is not mine- i was not allowed to have a voice in that decision- period done- she bought it - and i was never asked how i felt - i did not count then i won't count later
25 | TomSandy Brown | 2 | 1344131675683081_1847289995515618 | I say BS on this it's is the left trying to sway your vote the Republicans are standing with trump. They are only few Republican that turned away and that because Trump is going to change the way they have worked for years. That would be the ones that were in it for them self not for the American people.

Why any single person in this country would want to elect a man who sounds like a junior high school kid and has the intelligence of a Jr. high school kid is beyond me.....way beyond. I keep wondering how much of the Donald Trump thing is actually a reaction to the audacity that we elected a black man as president. So many racist pricks out there, just couldn't handle that I guess.
6 | Lance Harbor | 5 | 725925144239180_727197844111910 | Tell the Trump operative on a few minutes ago you can easily search all 650k emails in a few days. There is this great new technology called software. Do a keyword search for only Clinton emails then read them. It could have been a few hundred. In fact I'm surprised it took this long.I know Trump supporters are uneducated. But, I did not realize it extended to campaign staffers.

8 | Debbie Parker | 0 | 725925144239180_727542720744089 | Here is more - Found this ....BILL CLINTON'S LOVING WIFE --- by DICK MORRISIf you happen to see the Bill Clinton five minute TV ad for Hillary in which he introduces the commercial by saying he wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary's background, beware as I was there for most of their presidency and know them better than just about anyone. I offer a few corrections:Bill says: "In law school Hillary worked on legal services for the poor."Facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in 'Law School' was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a 'Federal Agent.' She went to Court every day as part of a Law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.Bill says: "Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a Children's rights project for poor kids."Facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.Bill says: "Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers."Facts are: She flunked the D.C. bar exam, 'Yes', flunked it, it is a matter of record, and only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas, 'None', and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She did not join the prestigious Rose Law Firm until Bill became Arkansas Attorney General and was made a partner only after he was elected Arkansas Governor.Bill says: "President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its Chairman."Facts are: The appointment was in exchange for Bill's support for Carter in his 1980 primary against Ted Kennedy. Hillary then became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter's choice to be chairman.Bill says: "She served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital."Facts are: Yes she did. But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the Wal-Mart Board of Directors, for a substantial fee. She was silent about their labor and health care practices.Bill says: "Hillary didn't succeed at getting health care for all Americans in 1994 but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance."Facts are: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. I know; I helped to negotiate the deal. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals' tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.Bill says: "Hillary was the face of America all over the World." (LOL)Facts are: Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House. Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them.Bill says: "Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for Children's and Women's issues."Facts are: Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation. One set up a national park in Puerto Rico. A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid 911 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire N.Y. delegation. Presently she is trying to have the US memorialize Woodstock.Here is what bothers me more than anything else about Hillary Clinton. She has done everything possible to weaken the President and our Country (that's you and me) when it comes to the 'War on Terror'.1. She wants to close GITMO and move the combatants to the USA where they would have access to our legal system.2. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of suspected Al Qaeda phone calls to/from the USA.3. She wants to grant constitutional rights to enemy combatants captured on the battlefield.4. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of money transfers between suspected Al Qaeda cells and supporters in the USA.5. She wants to eliminate the type of interrogation tactics used by the Military & CIA where coercion might be used when questioning known terrorists even though such tactics might save American lives.One cannot think of a single 'Bill', Hillary has introduced or a single comment she has made that would tend to strengthen our Country in the 'War on Terror'. But, one can think of a lot of comments she has made that weaken our Country and makes it a more dangerous situation for all of us. Bottom line: She goes hand in hand with the ACLU on far too many issues where common sense is abandoned.Share this with everyone you know, ask them to prove Dick Morris wrong. Think about it - he's (Dick Morris) said all of this openly, thus if he were not truthful he'd be liable for 'Defamation of Character' !And you better believe Hillary would sue him.Her winning in 2016 means the final death knell for America! Her whole public life has been a LIE.By Dick Morris, former political advisor to President Bill ClintonTHERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE UNAWARE OF THESE FACTS
9 | Jacqueline Davis | 1 | 725925144239180_727192324112462 | So true President Obama if you don't vote it's because you didn't want to and if you don't vote don't complain and if you think your vote don't count ask yourself why are they campaigning so hard to get your vote just go VOTE
10 | Chris Blankenship | 2 | 725925144239180_727438260754535 | The last time Hillary and Obama ran against each other, Obama said Hillary was not fit to be President and is an evil person. Now he thinks she is so great. Obama and Clinton are such liars. Just look at videos and during the last election, these two ran against each other.

Don't let anyone intimidate you, not the Republicans, not your spouse, family or church.
16 | Jason Rayborn | 0 | 725925144239180_727402424091452 | Hillary's father, Hugh Rodham, Sr., was reportedly a "fixer" and "bagman" for banks and insurance companies, here and overseas. Her brothers have reportedly aligned themselves with business in the former Soviet Union, described by some as with the criminal oligarchs of the Russian mafiya and their laundry banks. In the Clinton administration, there was no effective scrutiny or restraint of the Russian criminals operating in U.S. big cities, like Chicago, Cleveland, and New York. America's secret political police, the FBI, the CIA, and the DEA, have been willfully blind. With impunity, dope from Southwest Red China floods into the U.S. through Chicago as a major intake point. According to law enforcement personnel, the Rodhams reportedly stem from links to the Gambino crime family in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

2 | Francisco Galdamez | 5 | 1344068735689375_1344164229013159 | Donald Trump is a scumbag at its finest in quality. Lets be realistic here people. Donald talks about our economy . How jobs are flying overseas!well last time I checked he is one of  the types of business men he is describing .He has lots of businesses out of the U.S of A. To avoid taxes . He talks about how the system walks all over the little guy but wait a minute, he does step all over the little guy by sueing and pumping fear into contractors that try to collect the full amount of money for their honest hard work they provided.He talks about law and order. How can trump supporters block in their minds  all the sexual assualts that Donald trump has done in his lifetime? More than just one is true, thats all it takesTo know that this man should be in jail and registered as a SEX OFFENDER not registered as a PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE! A poor man gets accused he is jailed until proven innocent. A rich man gets accused he roaming free and is thought to be above the law!#NEVERTRUMP2016
3 | Donna Bowman-Pilling | 3 | 1344068735689375_1344104185685830 | It is pretty sad that our Corporate Media no longer gives "REAL NEWS" to the people in this country. God forbid they discuss TPP, Net Neutrality, or the truth that Marco Rubio inserted a rider in the 2015 budget destroy the "risk corridor" in the Affordable Care Act which initiated the for profit health insurance companies to raise premiums. I realize people are busy working, raising their families, but there are some people in this country who are retired not working, etc who should be finding out this information because it is out there, but instead they spend time on video games, or listening to right-wing hate radio. This is our country, I don't want to be turned into what Hitler did in Germany. Wake up people!
4 | Andrew Johnson | 3 | 1344068735689375_1344113729018209 | I think anyone caught tampering or intimidating voters. Or anyone caught messing with the ballots should see maximum Federal penalty and prison time. That should clear the matter up pretty quick.
5 | Jack Morris | 0 | 1344068735689375_1344849952277920 | Ten reasons to vote Democrat #10. I vote Democrat because I love the fact that I can now marry whatever I want. I've decided to marry my German Shepherd.#9. I vote Democrat because I believe oil companies' profits of 4% on a gallon of gas are obscene, but the government taxing the same gallon at 15% isn't.#8. I vote Democrat because I believe the government will do a better job of spending the money I earn than I would.#7. I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is fine as long as nobody is offended by it.#6. I vote Democrat because I'm way too irresponsible to own a gun, and I know that my local police are all I need to protect me from murderers and thieves. I am also thankful that we have a 911 service that gets police to your home in order to identify your body after a home invasion. It will take the police an average of about 15 minutes to get to your house; 00 buckshot travels at about 1200 ft/sec.#5. I vote Democrat because I'm not concerned about millions of babies being aborted so long as we keep all death row inmates alive and comfy.#4. I vote Democrat because I think illegal aliens have a right to free health care, education, and Social Security benefits, and we should take away Social Security from those who paid into it.#3. I vote Democrat because I believe that businesses should not be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to break even and give the rest away to the government for redistribution as the Democrat Party sees fit.#2. I vote Democrat because I believe liberal judges need to rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit fringe kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters.And, the #1 reason I vote Democrat is because I think it's better to pay $billions$ for oil to people who hate us, but not drill our own because it might upset some endangered beetle, gopher, or fish here in America. We don't care about the beetles, gophers, or fish in those other countries

7 | Omar Bennett Sr. | 9 | 1344068735689375_1344092609020321 | I don't wanna hear about fraud, the only case this election was by a Trump supporter, when they go in low, we go in high and vote.
8 | Carmen Lescas | 8 | 1344068735689375_1344087805687468 | Hillary is not even in office and look at all the drama, death, chaos and destruction that surrounds her. How can Hillary possibly run the world's largest economy with so much baggage! This is what democrats get for rigging their primaries. This is what democrats get for operating like a criminal enterprise. This is what the corrupt corporate media gets for supporting a well known-corrupt career politician.

13 | Shari Simpson Wilcoxon | 0 | 1344068735689375_1344313645664884 | I Just Lost All Faith In Our Deeply Corrupt Legal System And In The Rule Of Law In The United StatesPOLITICS, CRIME, CONSPIRACYby MICHAEL SNYDERThe FBI just gave Hillary Clinton the biggest gift in the history of presidential politics. Two days before the election the FBI has announced that they are ending their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information. After reviewing the emails that were found on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner, FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress telling them that “we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.” That means that there will be no indictment, and the path is now clear for Hillary Clinton to become the next president of the United States on Tuesday unless an election miracle happens.These days it is unusual for a news story to hit me on a deeply emotional level, but this one sure did. When the FBI originally announced that they were renewing this investigation, it gave me a glimmer of hope that there may be a little bit of integrity left in our legal system.But after today’s announcement I have lost all faith in our deeply corrupt system of justice. America has become a lawless nation, and the rule of law is completely dead in this country.Yes, it is true that those of us in the general public do not know what was contained in those emails, and Director Comey says that nothing significant was found in them…In a letter to lawmakers, Comey said the FBI is standing by its original findings, made in July, that Clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information over email as secretary of State.“The FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,” Comey said in the letter. “During that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of State,” Comey wrote. “Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.”But of course the truth is that the FBI already had more than enough to go after Clinton based on what they discovered the first time around.In the world of national security, if you transmit a single classified document via a channel that is unsecured, you will lose your security clearance in a heartbeat and it is quite likely that you will be prosecuted and sent to prison for mishandling classified information.In fact, two different members of the U.S. military were recently convicted for doing precisely that…Just last month, Bryan Nishimura, a California Naval reservist, was sentenced to two years’ probation and a $7,500 fine after he pleaded guilty to removing classified material and downloading it to a personal electronic device. The FBI found no evidence he planned to distribute the material.Last year, Bronze Star recipient and combat veteran Chief Petty Officer Lyle White pleaded guilty to storing classified documents on a nonsecure hard drive in Virginia. He received a suspended 60-day sentence and a suspended $10,000 fine in return for the plea. White said the information was for training purposes to study and that he had no intent to communicate with anyone.Neither of those individuals intended to mishandle classified information, and they certainly never intended to share it.But they were both convicted anyway.So what makes Hillary Clinton any different?During the initial investigation, the FBI found 113 emails that contained classified information…Clinton had repeatedly said she did not have any classified emails on her server, but the results of the FBI investigation show that claim was incorrect.Of the tens of thousands of emails investigators reviewed, 113 contained classified information, and three of those had classification markers. FBI Director James Comey has said Clinton should have known that some of the 113 were classified, but others she might have understandably missed.And I would be willing to bet that the FBI found some more classified emails that they had not seen previously among the 650,000 or so that they reviewed for this renewed investigation.But it doesn’t matter now. Hillary Clinton is free as a bird even though she mishandled 113 classified emails, and it looks like she is going to become the next president of the United States on Tuesday.As a law student and then later as an attorney working in Washington D.C., I got to see just how deeply corrupt our legal system has become.But after today, I don’t see how any American can ever have faith in the rule of law again.If the law does not apply equally to all persons at all times and in all circumstances, we might as well not even have a legal system.At this point, there is only one way that some sort of justice can be achieved in this case. And that is if the American people go to the polls on Tuesday and vote to keep her out of the White House.It won’t be perfect justice of course, but at least it would keep Hillary Clinton from getting what she wants more than anything else in life.The choice before the American people is very simple. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt politician to ever run for the presidency, and the extremely long laundry list of Clinton scandals and crimes has been well documented over the past three decades.The voters know exactly what they are getting with her. And if they choose her anyway despite all of the things that have been revealed, that means that America is willingly choosing lawlessness.To most conservatives, this election is all about Trump, but I believe that it is far more about Hillary Clinton.I am convinced that we are at a pivotal moment in American history, and if the American people willingly choose Hillary Clinton it will be an indication that there is zero hope for the future of this nation.So let us pray for an election miracle, because right now Donald Trump is behind in most national polls and time is running out.
14 | Carmen Lescas | 0 | 1344068735689375_1344088232354092 | Hillary created this by being dishonest, by going around congress, by lying to the FBI, by lying to congress and by lying to the American people. Comey is just the messenger. Don't blame the gun, blame the human who fires it.The Clintons have been selling the country at the expense of the American worker. This house of cards is crumbling, the ACA is crumbling, just the other day Loretta Lynch had to plead the 5th on the Iran ransom money. Obama's admin is falling apart right before our eyes. I have NEVER seen so much corruption in this country. We're like a banana republic.
15 | Ramon Cordero | 2 | 1344068735689375_1344134182349497 | So much for the so called emails scandal. Republicans were trying to find anything to see what sticks. Get over it. You got nothing on her now. She is a good person and will be your next president. Trump is a hateful, racist, arrogant, person and will never be our president. Americans want someone that represent our values. Trump does not live up to those values.
16 | Annette Ansley | 3 | 1344068735689375_1344117645684484 | Let's see: 650,000 emails reviewed in 9 days. That's 70,000 per day. On an around the clock review that's about 3,000 per hour or 50 per minute. Close to one per second. Yup, I'm ok with his absolution. The system is rigged!
17 | Franklin Strum | 0 | 1344068735689375_1344137145682534 | Look even in my state Kansas. Non citizens will vote. The people who registered on the National Voter Registration Form have not been verified to be citizens. The state can't verify because of activist judges. I just hope enough Kansas residents that are US Citizens outnumber the non citizens illegally voting in this election. I just wish Obama would have not secured this election for Hillary and other Democrats by not deporting illegals and not getting rid of citizenship verification. And with Hillary promising executive order pathway to citizenship you know non citizens will vote.
18 | Franklin Strum | 0 | 1344068735689375_1344146049014977 | Trump should challenge this election. I have no doubt if he forced all states to check voters if they are who they say they are, voted only once and are US citizens you will see fraud at it's highest in this election. States can only verify voters are eligible especially citizenship status for fraud, and Trump can contest to initiate a nationwide fraud check that means checking every single ballot not just the 100-200 ballots each state only checks for fraud in each election
19 | Franklin Strum | 0 | 1344068735689375_1344140269015555 | It's obvious Trump was leading in battleground states and in dead heat in others. That liberal organizations and activists judges wanted the dead people and non citizens secure the election for Hillary and Democrats.
20 | Jorge W DeQueiroz | 5 | 1344068735689375_1344073512355564 | Everyone should watch Assange's interview aired yesterday.Thank you from my heart Julian. Extraordinary interview. You are a true hero. Those tears you held back showed us all the deep pain of being inhumanely locked up in that small place without sunlight and far from your family ... a vicious torture. The good you have been doing to us all through your impeccable work is priceless. My prayers are with you ... that you are soon released from this illegal barbaric imprisonment. It's heartbreaking to see what these monsters are doing to you and your children and wife. Stay strong mate ... millions of us throughout the world are with you. God bless you!

Two more states to add to the write Bernie to save the world vote, California and Washington can write in Bernie for a future to believe in. Vermont, Wyoming, Oregon, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Iowa, Delaware, and Alabama, write in Bernie too. Everybody else, your job is to vote third party so we can be rid of Trump/Clinton and kick this thing to the US House. The goal, keep Trump and Clinton out of the top three. Oh and big thanks to Utah for leading the way and going third party, neither Clinton nor Trump will reach 270, lets try to keep them out of the top three America!
24 | Lola L. Lee | 4 | 1344068735689375_1344069635689285 | Vote Trump!! Down with the corrupt, warmongering, deceitful, criminal Clinton! The elimination of Obamacare, TPP, Common Core, many regulations that hurt businesses, are things us libertarians have been fighting for. Also, School Choice, bringing education back to the states, Audit The Fed, lowering our taxes, lowering taxes on companies to 15%, less interventionist foreign policy, federal hiring freeze, fixing veteran care, no mandated vaccines, term limits, defunding the U.N., a national right to carry, protecting our 2nd Amendment, Supreme Court Justices who will protect and defend The Constitution, are enough reasons for me to vote for Mr. Trump! For the most liberty, right at our fingertips, Vote Trump!
25 | Carl Tompkins | 5 | 1344068735689375_1344081362354779 | Harry Truman once said that "The only way you can get rich in politics is to be a crook". How exactly can the Clintons go from being dead broke as they claimed in 2000 to a personal net worth in excess of $200 million today while being public servants in government?

15 | Roberto Perez | 88 | 1344027412360174_1344030139026568 | But she's done nothing wrong. She's never been charged with anything. Get over it people.
16 | Sylvia Queen | 60 | 1344027412360174_1344050505691198 | Kellyanne, don't use big words you don't understand...words like honesty, trustworthiness, and veracity. If you understood, you would know that Madam President Hillary Clinton possesses all of those qualities and more, whether you like it or not.
17 | Charlize-ann Gonzalez | 98 | 1344027412360174_1344032295693019 | Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (and has cheated on his wives). Elect him. Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. Put her in jail. 2 Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem. Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State).  So savvy... Put him in the white house. Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz. Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible. Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is. Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support him and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact. Your memes are not news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform.#trumpisapieceofshit#orangturd
18 | Monique Johnson | 52 | 1344027412360174_1344044282358487 | My God, does this woman ever stop for a breath.  I wish the media would realize that they can interrupt and correct her when she is lying.
19 | D Manuel Espinosa | 79 | 1344027412360174_1344035942359321 | Kellyanne Conway STFU. MSNBC everytime you have Kellyanne on you should have a Clinton campaign manager, chairmen, or surrogate to disk after her lies and rhetoric. She's a LIAR and FRAUD just like her candidate. Biased media for trump.
20 | Donna Mackintosh | 59 | 1344027412360174_1344036015692647 | Still makes me mad that Comey intervened and ruined the huge win Hillary would have had. She is still going to win but I don't think she will get the electoral college victory I wanted.
21 | Thomas J. Beaver | 52 | 1344027412360174_1344033962359519 | No "backtracking" from this Clinton supporter wrt Comey ... screw Comey ... the damage has been done, he put his thumb on the scale, the FBI piled on with a 10 pound weight ... it took her down 2 points. The damage is done - did I say that? Screw him. Comey was wrong in July, he was wrong a week ago, he's wrong now. The FBI is tainted, corrupt. The days of Herbert Hoover are back (... and, FWIW, Guilani may well be in legal trouble).
22 | Sherry Johnson Balch | 45 | 1344027412360174_1344036385692610 | Just listening to this ignorant twit would drive me to vote for Clinton if nothing else. The fact that I rarely see an MSNBC interviewer herd her back to the topic/question asked of her about Trump when she immediately starts talking about Clinton to avoid answering each and every time floors me. You all need to learn to get your answers and not get played by a propagandist. CNN has been doing a better  job at this with her.
23 | Jar A Raf | 36 | 1344027412360174_1344039642358951 | Go try something else.... We don't care what you guys think... Hillary is way more honest then Trump.... Let Trump shows his e mails and his unpaid taxes..... Talk about that and stop losing your time.... Because Hillary will be the next president of the USA.... Period.!!!
24 | Emmit Penny | 31 | 1344027412360174_1344038502359065 | I can't wait till November 9th when Trump refuses to pay anyone and sues the lot for his loss. The FBI still maintains that there has been no wrong doing on the part of Sectary Clinton. He says they still won't be filing charges. Most likely Hillary rigged the whole thing. 😂😂😂Remember VOTE BLUE!!!
25 | Kim Ritter | 41 | 1344027412360174_1344039715692277 | So what would we have found if Wikileaks have published emails from the Trump Foundation, the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Christie, Ailes and the rest of the corrupt crew? Why should America trust Trump and Conway, when the Canadians just published a list of 500 lies that he told?

"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton," FBI Director Comey wrote in the letter to 16 House and Senate members. http://on.msnbc.com/2fIZk3i

1 | Sheila Strunk | 1200 | 1344016045694644_1344016689027913 | FBI needs some house keeping. They are not a partisan agency, and agents who can't get that should be fired. The Hatch Act was written for a reason.

The media lies to us, our President lies to us, our Congress lie to us, and the politicians and lawmakers that work for us, lie to us .. There's one choice America: Donald J. Trump for President. 🇺🇸.
4 | Nancy Coleman Buglino | 208 | 1344016045694644_1344027939026788 | After millions of people have voted, Comey and his peeps came out with a letter admitting they reviewed all Hillary Clinton emails and concluded NOTHING WAS THERE. Thanks for causing undue disruption before the election!!!
5 | Marie Inneo | 261 | 1344016045694644_1344023315693917 | Allow me to summarize his letter to Republican Committee Chairmen, "I have done all the damage I could do and now will admit that there is nothing to reveal. Where do I collect my 30 pieces of silver?"
6 | Cheryl Bolden | 259 | 1344016045694644_1344022459027336 | While this is great news for Secretary Clinton, the nation has suffered greatly. We now know that the lead civil law enforcement agency is clearly biased if not condoning criminal activity of individuals who work there. By providing information to the Trump campaign, individuals in the FBI have clearly violated the Hatch Act thus subject for termination of employment.
7 | Alec Drake | 244 | 1344016045694644_1344018895694359 | There was no case here!!! Most of the emails were duplicates! Comey should never had said anything until they looked at all the "new" emails to begin with. He just helped Trump! Hillary is still going to win but not by the margin I was hoping.

And when there are more terrorist attacks in this country, healthcare costs sky rocket, etc., the Dems will blame the Republicans for all the chaos and problems because their dear sweet Hillary would never do that to our great country. They will never swallow their pride and admit that they made a huge mistake voting for her!! I fear for my children and grandchildren if she becomes the next POTUS.

16 | Jim Nab | 27 | 1344016045694644_1344040332358882 | Glad this came out before Election Day. In summary Hillary is 100% transparent with releasing 30 years of tax returns and every email she wrote is public. On the other hand that narcissist Trump's business is a complete mystery. How sad that so many Republicans have ignored this huge red flag and still voting for a man that promotes hatred, racism and bigotry.

19 | Joyce Bailey Roberson | 36 | 1344016045694644_1344030649026517 | Good for her! She has been under investigation for 30 years. How much tax money has gone into these fruitless efforts? These people REALLY don't want a woman to be elected president. They are so worried that she is going to show up all the men who have held the job and open the doorway for more women in the future. It must suck really bad to be a Trump supporter!!! Excited about Taco Tuesday!!!
20 | Todd Wiggs | 12 | 1344016045694644_688354328006255 | This news came pretty quickly after the announcement was made that Clinton s maid was printing off her emails.

The email issue may be closed for now but he did not say anything about the Clinton Foundation investigation.
21 | Chris Sabin-Dad | 16 | 1344016045694644_1428403243855907 | Of course nothing was found, money well spent. If all the people voting for this government don't see the politics, then u are the problem too. She should be in jail and the foundation should be dealt with. This election is bought. Time for a person with no ties to anyone but the American people.
22 | Ed Gabriele | 5 | 1344016045694644_688397708001917 | Fire Comey. He violated the Hatch Act. Period. He broke the law. If the FBI director can't keep the law, how can he push others to do so? Hypocrisy. Typical trump the Truth attempt.

24 | Lisa Rotterdam | 12 | 1344016045694644_688365728005115 | You are either lying to yourself or delusional if you think Hillary Clinton should be cleared. You don't have to like Trump to understand that.
25 | Saurabh Jani | 9 | 1344016045694644_1344023175693931 | A very very dark and gloomy day for Conservatives all over as they still fail to understand that a vast majority of these emails were just duplicates of what F B I looked at initially.

These kids can't vote for real. But one day they will. 

Nearly 400,000 kids cast their votes for Hillary Clinton or Donald J. Trump in a nationwide mock election. Here's who won: http://nbcnews.to/2eogksI
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Denise A Spencer | 59 | 1557711154248909_1559894120697279 | So now we learn from the Republican FBI Director that there is nothing criminal about Hillary's email... It's all just a made up story to get Trump and republicans elected as they can't run on their policy of giving tax cuts to the rich.The right wing media is also to blame for hyping this non story for republican distractions.
2 | Beverly Southall | 25 | 1557711154248909_1559914020695289 | I loved the little boy at the end......he had my thoughts exactly. I'd take Obama for 4 more years over DT or HC , ANYTIME.
3 | Fontaine Moore | 11 | 1557711154248909_1559922807361077 | Depending on the sample of the kids, we know how parents are voting because kids this age virtually never have a sufficiently developed intellect to form an opinion different from their parents, although they may express it in slightly different terms.
4 | Ernest Hatton | 11 | 1557711154248909_1559971874022837 | Let's keep it simple. These kids are a lot smarter than the adults not voting for Hillary. BTW, she has again been cleared of no wrong doing!She never has been guilty of a criminal act. Those who cannot understand that and instead pass on untruths are a sorry lot.
5 | Gene Fierro | 5 | 1557711154248909_1560005624019462 | Pretty simple here- do you identify with a guy like Trump?- Is your family like his? Are you comfortable with the Bannon/Stone Alt Right white supremacist /anti Semitic agenda?Do you feel the same as he does about minorities?- disabled people? Women?Have no concern about his business record? Have no concern about his overwhelming lack of understanding of world affairs? His lack of experience in foreign or domestic affairs? Do you identify with his temperament?  His Anger? His 3:00 am Tweeting? Have No concern that he "knows more then the Generals"?- that he's offered no plan or policy on how he'll "create jobs"if you do and you think America and its allies are safer and that your life will be better then go for it- for the rest of us it's no contest!!
6 | Laurie Nicastro | 9 | 1557711154248909_1559986144021410 | Dear American Fathers,If your DAUGHTER was alone in a room with Donald Trump would you TRUST him. He DIDN'T defend his own Daughter. He isn't going to depend YOURS.VOTE FOR HILLARY on Nov. 8thYou deserve someone who will fight for her RIGHTS because "Women's Rights are Human Rights and Human Rights are Womens Rights"
7 | Lisa Perea-Koeller | 2 | 1557711154248909_1559921900694501 | Some are already influenced by media and probably family it is sad they are so young. I hope as they grow up they learn to educate themselves to have there own voice make decisions based on facts not what they see on tv or hear from people around them. It's important to have your own opinions.
8 | Eddie Vega | 1 | 1557711154248909_1560022034017821 | Somehow as elections come and go, candidates tend to focus on less about the country we're all supposed to leave our children. I see the rallies on TV and wonder where our focus is and how we set our priorities on issues that divide us unnecessarily.
9 | RaCina Ellison | 4 | 1557711154248909_1559970470689644 | Trump followers, please don't say anything horrible and nasty about the children, don't call them names, they are only children..... Please show you can be adults...

Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.👁⚠️If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.👁⚠️If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.👁⚠️If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.👁⚠️If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.👁⚠️If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?👁⚠️If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? 👁

15 | Amir Parvez | 9 | 1557711154248909_1559893570697334 | Hillary Clinton supporters are guilty of supporting a corrupt, evil, lying war-criminal who should have been rotting in a prison if there was real justice in USA. And it has nothing to do with Trump. It's just what she is and it's not just ignorant to support her, it's inhumane.There comes a time when ignorance is no longer a forgivable offense.Her supporters must be held responsible for the economic slavery and evil wars Clinton, her corporate owners and oligarch friends will wage all over the world.

Brown was a 12 year veteran of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department before spending the last six years in the FBI.Neighbors saw smoke coming from the Brown residence and called 9-1-1 at approximately 11:50 p.m. By the time fire crews arrived on scene minutes later, the entire house was engulfed in flames.“Mrs. Brown’s death was caused by a gunshot wound prior to the house fire,” Walkerville Police Chief Pat Frederick said, “while Mr. Brown’s single-bullet head wound appears to have been self-inflicted.”“The totality of the evidence leads us to believe this is a murder-suicide. We believe he killed her, set the house on fire and then took his own life,” Frederick said.The findings support conclusions by investigators Saturday that the couple perished in a murder-suicide during which the 4,000-square foot house was intentionally set on fire. A neighbor told WHAG that Brown appeared “panicked” ❗️The motive behind the killing is still being investigated, but police say Brown was a highly respected agent with the FBI and very well liked in the community. “What leads someone to this level of anger and violence with your wife, your loved one, who knows,” said an FBI official who knew the Brown family❗️Conspiracy theories are running rampant throughout many alt. right media outlets, leading many to believe this was another “hit job” by the Clintons in retaliation for the FBI email leaks so close to the presidential election. Media outlets like Alex Jones’ Infowars and WND are running with the theory that globalist assassins, working for the Clintons, had the Brown family murdered and their home burned to destroy any possible evidence❗️FBI Director James Comey refused to comment at this time but asked for privacy and prayer as the bureau comes to terms with losing “two very close friends.”BREAKING:  FLORIDA EARLY VOTING RESULTS SHOW TRUMP WINNING BY LANDSLIDEMedia continues to advance phony polls and false narratives...  so they can try to steal the election at the ballot box with the help of the George Soros controlled voting machines in key swing states... so a Clinton win would seem plausible❗️It is going to be a real stretch for them to make a Clinton win seem plausible Please keep forwarding this story how many people have to die at the hands of the Clintons to satisfy their greed and their ambitions❓
21 | Rudy Gadrey | 3 | 1557711154248909_1559893907363967 | NOW CHILDREN ARE RIGGED LOFLohnoooooooooooo........ not reality again!!!!FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers on Sunday that after reviewing additional evidence, the agency has not changed its conclusion that there is not a case to bring against Hillary Clinton for how she handled classified materials through her private email server.“Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,” Comey said in the letter. “During that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State. Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton. I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.”
22 | Desiree Seal | 0 | 1557711154248909_1559979397355418 | WASHINGTON – Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Reince Priebus released the following statement on FBI Director James Comey’s letter to Congress on the Hillary Clinton email investigation:“The FBI’s findings from its criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton’s secret email server were a damning and unprecedented indictment of her judgment. The FBI found evidence Clinton broke the law, that she placed highly classified national security information at risk and repeatedly lied to the American people about her reckless conduct. None of this changes the fact that the FBI continues to investigate the Clinton Foundation for corruption involving her tenure as secretary of state. Hillary Clinton should never be president.”

JUST IN: FBI Director Comey: "We have not changed our conclusions" after Clinton email review. http://on.msnbc.com/2edCX4H
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Alec Drake | 805 | 1343993245696924_1343994335696815 | Still makes me mad that Comey intervened and ruined the huge win Hillary would have had. She is still going to win but I don't think she will get the electoral college victory I wanted.
2 | Dante Gambino | 548 | 1343993245696924_1343994439030138 | Conservative morons are not going to like this. LOL. #voteblue
3 | Scott Dietrich | 406 | 1343993245696924_1343995322363383 | Once again trump ran his mouth , not having the facts . Not a great leader
4 | Philip E. McDaniel | 222 | 1343993245696924_1343996729029909 | Hillary VINDICATED (again)!!  FBI Director Comey just sent another letter to Congress stating that they found no evidence that differed from his July pronouncement. Now, if the FBI could just "un-ring" a bell, put the caulk back into the tube, erase the lie from everyone's mind and rectify the horrid effect of his eleven day from the election "hatchet job." As I have been stating for over a year, the email is a non-issue. But the misinformation promulgated about Hillary by the GOP, Trump, Russia, the media (all) and even the FBI will long live in the annals of history as an open assault on our democratic process and indelibly imbued in the hearts and souls of those who have served to defend it.
5 | Emma Hollowell | 195 | 1343993245696924_1343997869029795 | There was nothing there in those email in the first place.So, now Trump is the only one facing jail time.She will not face any charges.He said there were duplicates of what he have already seen.
6 | Martha Hoffer | 227 | 1343993245696924_1343999042363011 | TOO LATE! We need to investigate FBI Comey, Congressman Jason Chaffetz, RNC Reince Priebus (Can't be trusted), Congressman Tray Gowdy,Rudy Giuliani,  Newt Gingrich , ALLl responsible for this 30 year witch hunt fiasco all because she dared to contribute and serve when she was young! Republicans deliberately sabotaged Democratic Election and we the people want action taken against those that changed this election in favor of Trump!
7 | Sherry Lang Brock | 161 | 1343993245696924_1343998285696420 | This isn't news to Dems and the Repuks won't believe it. Comey should be charged, lose his job, and be jailed. The only thing that needs to be investigated now is the FBI from the top to the bottom and charges filed against any leakers for treason.
8 | Gary Needle | 123 | 1343993245696924_1344001195696129 | This shows how the FBI under Comey has been an agent for Trump. This is disgusting and talk about rigged election. Comey needs to be held accountable for his unprecedented actions.
9 | Lee Wolfe | 91 | 1343993245696924_1343999422362973 | So stinking irresponsible of Comey! What about the thousands who early voted based on the erroneous assumption that Clinton was "under investigation " from the FBI? This is the worst election season ever.
10 | Cristy Gilbert | 80 | 1343993245696924_1343995012363414 | Donald J. Trump, will now blast Comey...bigly!! Lol, Drumpf sucks!!
11 | Anthony Jay Russell | 46 | 1343993245696924_1343996205696628 | America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves. Abraham Lincoln
12 | Serrell Law | 34 | 1343993245696924_1343998872363028 | Too late!!! Idiot already put it in the minds of the wavering and the deplorable. Plus Drumph has taken it and ran with it spewing lies and hate.  #StepDownComey
13 | Gloria Marie Pucci Stenberg | 23 | 1343993245696924_1344002522362663 | And now, ladies and gentlemen, we shall hear Donnie rant. And as always, he will say EVERYTHING twice, you know, for effect. Believe me. Believe me.
14 | Connie Woods Warrenfeltz | 20 | 1343993245696924_1344001032362812 | I will never understand why Comey and "others" were permitted to make their announcement last week, knowing it might upend this election (which was most likely their objective).  What they revealed last week was NOTHING...just like an episode of Seinfeld...all about nothing!!!!  How big of the FBI to come out two days prior to the election and magically reveal that all is well.  A lot of heads need to roll, from the top down.  Since when is the FBI given a pass on what amounts to something that smacks of treason?
15 | Bette Winterberg Urban | 17 | 1343993245696924_1344013209028261 | OMG..."it will take weeks or even months to complete this"" it took just long enough to try and influence the election... disgusting... The FBI has lost its credibility.... by becoming political.....
16 | Julie B. Reiley | 23 | 1343993245696924_1344002799029302 | This is excellent news, and what I expected. However, I'm very frustrated the FBI commented in the first place on this; it's been used by Trump for incendiary ads that do not move the political discourse forward and have unfairly damaged Secretary Clinton's campaign - and the Dems chances at winning back the Senate.
17 | Leonard Mills | 19 | 1343993245696924_1344009945695254 | This is plain out some b.s. Trump and his supporters got 9 days to call the woman a criminal and plant the seed in already weak minded voters. However i'm upset because not once did they remind people of Trump's real live court cases coming up....the fraud case and the rape case......ooooh they forgot about all these woman accusing him.....emails are more important! The right must not be allowed to control the conversation....usually lies aren't far away!
18 | Glenda Napier | 21 | 1343993245696924_1344005272362388 | Trump is now "yelling" in Minneapolis. So far he has yet to mention Comey's latest letter. Instead he is yapping,like the puppy he is. She hasn't bothered to come here. I am sick of just seeing his face! Let alone hearing his voice!
19 | Mary Jo Pittera | 22 | 1343993245696924_1344001439029438 | This was bull. 😡FBI needs to be investigated - along with Giuliani. HILLARY and all Democratic candidates were sabotaged.
20 | Tao Valentine | 10 | 1343993245696924_1344005749029007 | This doesn't absolve Comey of the consequences for intervening in our democratic process! We all knew nothing was going to come of this, but he chose to deliberately obfuscate protocol in an obviously partisan attempt to influence voters. My opinion that he should lose his job (at minimum) still stands.
21 | Shanna L Cochran | 5 | 1343993245696924_1344015452361370 | This is such bull sh**!! Wiki leaks has put out enough to put her under a jail house. For God sake it come out this morning that she was having her maid fax and email classified information for her. What the hell are you people blind???
22 | Lisa Perea-Koeller | 12 | 1343993245696924_1343999535696295 | Yeah after people voted against her. Like Donald said it's not to late to go have your vote changed. So go change it back to Hillary if the lies before made you change your mind you can go back and fix it.
23 | Ryan Spencer | 2 | 1343993245696924_1768512276744025 | She's lucky this time. You're ignorant if you think she won't do it again. Next time she might not be so lucky and when she releases classified information to isis or another terror organization  you and the other idiots that voted her in can go lay on the bombs. And when she does nothing with Obamacare and raises your taxes and we go deeper in debt and we stay the course of wasting time and money in the Middle East and eventually our country goes broke and it's another Great Depression I hope you have a Hillary sign in your front yard so people know how did it.
24 | Elaine Duplessis Landry | 3 | 1343993245696924_1768506790077907 | Hillary and obummer threatened Comey! NO WAY they went through 650,000 emails AND there are none classified! BULL! And we find out today her maid had access to her documents! Give me a break! Comey either got paid or got scared! No problem: TRUMP WILL BEAT THIS EVIL WITCH!
25 | Sandra L. Center | 5 | 1343993245696924_1768498893412030 | Thank God he said this but too bad he said anything in the first place! Who knows how many early voters decided there really was truth to the email accusations because of his letter a week + ago? People need to vote now with the knowledge that all of this drama about the emails was a total waste of time & THEIR money in a cynical attempt to interfere with an election by defaming HRC. Shame on him, the FBI, Trump, his surrogates & all  who jumped on this disgusting bandwagon. There's a "swamp" all right & it surrounds the Republican candidate & all his cronies.

With just days to go until the election, Gary Johnson is hoping to be the Chicago Cubs of the 2016 election.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lorraine A Kenny | 589 | 1343963942366521_1343964202366495 | At this point the only thing your doing is taking votes away, step aside. please
2 | Martha Ellis | 440 | 1343963942366521_1343966142366301 | No Gary, you have no chance of winning it. Please go back to Taos, where your most challenging question you will be asked is "red or green?". Your running mate has the right idea. Support Hillary Clinton because this country can't afford a Donald Trump presidency. Step aside please.
3 | Charla Breshears Brown | 150 | 1343963942366521_1343974512365464 | Well, you might wanna call your VP candidate there and try to get on the same page, because Bill Weld has seen the light and checked out on ya. #BecauseHesSmartYouSee
4 | David Becker | 82 | 1343963942366521_1343981782364737 | This guy is just plain dumb. It is not the marijuana. Funny, his V.P. is endorsing Hillary Clinton. I wanted to like Gary, but every time I see him, he has a blank, deer in the headlights look.He will never be president. He is just sifting votes away from Clinton.
5 | Stephanie Goenner | 69 | 1343963942366521_1343974085698840 | Gary Johnson has my vote. We will get the Libertarians to at least 5% and they will get money, ballot access and minor party recognition. No way could I vote for either of the major party candidates ✌#johnsonweld2016
6 | Anthony Senn | 31 | 1343963942366521_1343975269032055 | I voted for Gary. Sadly he isn't gonna win. We're gonna get 1 of 2 lying war mongers. I just wish the people would recognize how bad Trump and Hillary will be for this country. Don't listen to the "wasted vote" crowd. Even if Gary doesn't win. Think of the future. If he can get 5% then the Libertarian party gets in on the debate, campaign funding and so much more. We need a Libertarian in the White House.
7 | Charla Breshears Brown | 22 | 1343963942366521_1343975142365401 | The Libertarians missed the boat by not having Bill Weld at the top of the ticket. They could have easily won this election.
8 | Orlando Elith | 17 | 1343963942366521_1343979965698252 | Omg so many funny comments. Thanks ppl I'm laughing so hard !!! Best one so far " He couldn't win at bowling with the bumpers up " by Jeff Bass
9 | Kenneth Corbett | 19 | 1343963942366521_1344027715693477 | i love how people blame 3rd party for taking vote, yet they vote for the same clowns over and over expecting different results. we would've had a clinton or bush for 28 years of our history think about that for a second.
10 | Marcial Cintron | 22 | 1343963942366521_1343968682366047 | This guy reminds me of the clueless guy in gta 5 trying to legalize weed by giving michael and trevor some crazy drugs looks like him and everything lol
11 | Christopher Ballard | 20 | 1343963942366521_1344015539028028 | Gary Johnson the only honest choice. I will not compromise my morals and vote for either of the other two. This is the year we send the message and vote 3rd party America.
12 | Paul Lebkuecher | 13 | 1343963942366521_1343989689030613 | What a complete idiot. He thinks he can win when he has only somewhere around 12% of the voters? Jill Stein is even stupider than he is. She has never had more than 2 to 5 percent. Most of their supporters would lean towards Hillary. If Trump does win they can pat themselves on the back.
13 | Regina Fleenor | 10 | 1343963942366521_1307821865917303 | Why don't you bow out with grace and allow your votes go to Hillary Clinton where they belong!!  You are just an albatross mudding the waters at this point with NO chance of even getting close to winning.
14 | Dennis Riehl | 12 | 1343963942366521_995691130557266 | What world does this guy live in??? Talk about being delusional. We need a president who can at least exercise some critical thinking, enough to know reality from fantasy! This guy should be giving tickets on rides at Disney World specifically Fantasy Land!
15 | Lydia Forrester Lampert | 13 | 1343963942366521_1344026029026979 | Smoke another one, Johnson! No one takes you seriously and all your doing is screwing around with the election! You're no better than Comey and his crony Giuliani!
16 | Raymond Brown | 2 | 1343963942366521_1505147189501054 | Just stop campaigning and help Clinton already. Gary Johnson has been dragging Bill Weld along for this ride. Weld wants to back Clinton because he is a smart and reasoned man. In all honesty, Bill Weld should have been the Presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party. But it really isn't a legit party. That convention was a joke. Sorry, but real talk.
17 | Patrick Riley | 14 | 1343963942366521_1343994379030144 | To all these people saying he has no chance of winning, we all understand that. The goal is winning 5% of the vote to get minor party status. This will help even the playing field and end the two party stranglehold on politics! #TeamGov #GaryJohnson2016
18 | Annmarie Anderson | 4 | 1343963942366521_1344072425689006 | If this was any other election we wouldn't be subjected to this idiot. I have more respect for Weld, the VP, who has been suggesting to vote Clinton. He even knows Johnson is a clown. Don't waste your vote. If not for anything else than civility. If you like Liberatarian for government out of your bedroom and private life, you won't like Trumpland.
19 | David Sillman | 5 | 1343963942366521_995731697219876 | STFU already Gary! If you or Jill cared a lick about this country or had half a functioning brain you'd realize that this year is like NO other in American history: we are on the verge of disaster if Trump wins. For the sake of common sense & decency you should have dropped out and thrown your support behind Hillary long ago (like Bernie did).
20 | Sherry Lang Brock | 7 | 1343963942366521_1343994622363453 | Anyone remember the egg frying in the pan back about 30-40 years ago that said "this is your brain on drugs"???  Well, apparently Gary didn't pay attention. So, now, this is what you get !!! Pay attention kids.
21 | Sam Shappell | 0 | 1343963942366521_1308642655835224 | Go gary. Voting clinton means you are blind to the governmwnts corruption she represents. Voting her in continues death and corruption over seas and voting trump in fuels hatred in america. How is johnson such a bad choice for someone. You have a right to vote who you believe would be the best president and to me that is Gary Johnson
22 | James Kasal | 0 | 1343963942366521_995851477207898 | Cubs analogy doesn't really work here since they were the #1 team in baseball in 2016 from wire to wire.... and Bill Weld didn't join forces with them and immediately start praising the Indians.
23 | Robert David | 0 | 1343963942366521_1505419329473840 | Gary Johnson likes to get "wet", butt-naked, ill. He's doing sherms, dust, PCP, primos, some p-dog. Better get right, Gary, or you they may find you with your shorts off in some Albuquerque dive motel with glazed-over eyes, talking about how you're going to build a new White House on Mars.
24 | Leah Peterson | 9 | 1343963942366521_1344029609026621 | Yes!!! The other two have the highest unapproval ratings in history!!! Trump cant beat Killary.. it only makes sense to vote peace prosperity and freedom! #johnsonweld2016!!!
25 | Gene Fierro | 2 | 1343963942366521_1307757439257079 | Pretty simple here- do you identify with a guy like Trump?- Is your family like his? Are you comfortable with the Bannon/Stone Alt Right white supremacist /anti Semitic agenda?Do you feel the same as he does about minorities?- disabled people? Women?Have no concern about his business record? Have no concern about his overwhelming lack of understanding of world affairs? His lack of experience in foreign or domestic affairs? Do you identify with his temperament?  His Anger? His 3:00 am Tweeting? Have No concern that he "knows more then the Generals"?- that he's offered no plan or policy on how he'll "create jobs"if you do and you think America and its allies are safer and that your life will be better then go for it- for the rest of us it's no contest!!

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Greg Ervin | 72 | 1557921600894531_1559782294041795 | The problem is that Trump's supporters aren't smart enough to actually understand how the government works. Out of desperation and ignorance they believe any piece of propaganda they read thus further plunging themselves in to the abyss of paranoia.
2 | Dustin J Davis Olson | 23 | 1557921600894531_1559793404040684 | Those voting for Hillary Clinton, defending Clinton and supporting Clinton without reading the information reported by WikiLeaks are intellectually no different than those who criticize climate science without ever having read the science. In short, if you defend Clinton and ignore WikiLeaks, you have something in common with Sarah Palin. Let that sink in for a moment. Finished processing that? Now process this — if the journalists responsible for reporting on Watergate were labeled “Russian sympathizers,” charged by the media as “attempting to influence an election,” and banned from travel or communication access, how would history judge the event? This is exactly what has happened to Julian Assange, who has done more for journalism than any of these corporate-owned, brand-named media products have done this election cycle. Either you support access to information or you have a problem with an informed public. Which side are you on?
3 | Tariq Marwan Al Mutawa | 20 | 1557921600894531_1559784927374865 | Please Americans wake up Donald J. Trump is the only insurance to avoid WW III.The Democrats are proven criminals from A to Z.Again and again Donald J. Trump has to wave out all the criminals in the US government nation wide in congress and in house and the entire criminal corrupt persons in US authorities and has to bring them to justice regardless without any exemption include Barack Obama. Washington DC is full of criminals who are trying to rule the world in a criminal way and in very close co-operation with the criminals from the Wall Street, include the criminals from the leading US media they have to be behind bars as well, the journalist and the owners of those Media stations.Again and again Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama this stands for corruption, fraud, supporting Wall Street in all criminal behaviours of national and international transactions, ISIS terrorist financing, TIPP, open borders, migrants, islamisation, NWO on behalf of the 5 most powerful families that control America and the world Rothschild, Rockefeller, Du Pont, Morgan and Bush and similar influential families and Hillary Clinton will initiate the WWIII.Americans, please please wake up and stop this US corrupt dictatorship which will be more and more manifested under Hillary Clinton as it was under Barack Obama and please stop the islamisation of the US.
4 | Pete Bender | 9 | 1557921600894531_1559784430708248 | So how did Hillary get so rich? Bernie says she was bought and paid for by Wall Street, was he wrong? And did he get bought off or blackmailed? Wikileaks says blackmailed and we know about the Lake House. So how did Hillary get so rich? Those must have been some really good speeches, too bad we aren't good enough donors to hear them.
5 | Star Marie | 10 | 1557921600894531_1559828544037170 | Vote! Vote! Vote! Get to your polling place and cast your ballot for Donald J. Trump! Make sure everyone you know votes, too. Offer a ride, whatever is needed. This is SO important to our country! We MUST turn out in force, and that means ALL of us! Every single vote counts and matters! Let's get it done! #Trump2016
6 | Joni Key | 0 | 1557921600894531_1560435780643113 | Hey all you Trump supporters...there ya go....he was probably hired to run in Utah to throw off the election so Trump could win that state therefore making it more favorable for him to win !!  Yes Trump supporters..." that's probably what happened" lol...the Democratic party probably hired him !  🙉 😂😱👀
7 | Stacy Mack | 10 | 1557921600894531_1559787410707950 | Wear RED On Election Day! Everyone... BREAKING NEWS! Clinton is now leading in the polls in key battleground states such as Qatar, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Syria and hopefully soon San Quentin
8 | Victoria Stewart | 2 | 1557921600894531_1559856000701091 | Too bad he didn't get in early enough to make it a real election and I am a Democrat who would vote for this man and whoever wins needs to have this man in the White House with them!!!
9 | Sherry Barbour Bell | 9 | 1557921600894531_1559801794039845 | My fellow Trump fans and voters!  I ask you that whatever happens on Tuesday, November the 8th 2016 - we will stay together on these groups and work to continue what he has started!  The media has failed our country and much of our government has too!  I pray for Trump - Pence and their wonderful families!  I pray that Donald Trump and his family will start their own national media company so we can continue to have a voice!  I am not giving up on praying for a Trump Landslide Win but we know how much voter fraud and cheating is going on!  So promise ourselves that this movement will go on and we will all stick together - all colors and races because it is not about race and we have already shown Obama and his Liberal NWO cronies that!  The future must be saved for our children and I am so proud of all the wonderful people I have met and seen on the Trump Groups!  True Americans of all colors and races who love this country and don't want to see it destroyed!Praise the Lord - In God We Trust!Hillary says don't listen to any Wikileaks that may come out in the next couple of days!Is this the best that Hillary can do? What an act of desperation! Wikileaks has not been shown to be "fake" ever, in regard to their releases. They are the only true journalism left in this world, sadly. So, I wonder what's about to be added to this list of most damaging wikileaks? http://mostdamagingwikileaks.com

Get Real!!!
11 | Lyle Olson | 1 | 1557921600894531_1559842384035786 | We will see when both are under 270 electoral votes who will be president. Who's in control of congress again lol can't wait until nov.8
12 | Sandy Weatherford | 5 | 1557921600894531_1559798247373533 | For true conservatives, he is the best choice. Trump is not a conservative. Trump was also pro abortion at the beginning of his campaign. Trump tried to get Marla Maples to have an abortion with Tiffany.
13 | Patricia Cook | 2 | 1557921600894531_1559996364020388 | There are some of us who can think for ourselves, so we do not need read  WikiLeaks stolen info that was hacked by Russia. WilkiLeaks Julian Assange who is hiding out in Ecuador Embassy, all
14 | Anthony Njigua | 0 | 1557921600894531_1560160614003963 | Hillary why don't you withdraw Utah and ask Dems to vote for McMullin and stick it to dt and hope he looses the 6 electoral votes??
15 | Roger Lee Lewis | 2 | 1557921600894531_1559814524038572 | Has anyone seen the video where Muslim immigrants think 9 year old girls should be considered adults think the video was taken in Michigan. You should really look it up and watch before voting Hillary is going to allow millions of them here if shes elected...scary stuff.
16 | Luis Mitchel Gomez Macias | 1 | 1557921600894531_1559861907367167 | This guy's gonna cost The Donald the whole election just by winning Utah, how about that? Hillary sure as hell can afford to lose Utah but if Donald doesn't win it, is over for him.
17 | Jason Gutmann | 2 | 1557921600894531_1559901924029832 | A people that elect corrupt politicians, imposters, thieves and traitors are not victims... but accomplices - George Orwell
18 | Danny Garza | 3 | 1557921600894531_1559839764036048 | "I was a lifetime democrat. I voted for Hillary in the primary. Since then, after learning the DNC cheated for her, she committed perjury, lying to congress that she never sent classified emails, hired dws after dws lied, used BleachBit to hide emails then lost and/or smashed evidence with a hammer.... she lost the moral/ethical election months ago and my vote. I'm personally ashamed to have unknowingly supported this activity. I will be voting Green party for the general. Not my original plan but electing hillary now sends a message to our children that lying, cheating, and committing crimes are ok as long as you win. We need role models to lead by teaching what is appropriate. She sullies feminism and women worldwide. Women should never be portrayed as too weak to win fairly. Ever. That is neither feminist, progressive, or "liberal". But that is the democratic party now... self-inflicting misogynists, solidifying female inferiority. She "didn't know" what her duties are, is utterly clueless, projecting female stupidity; that females are unfit to lead. My family is better than this.If you want to martyr for women, do it for a REAL woman, with morals and values. Jill Stein. Or anyone NOT Hillary Trump. Both are wasted protest votes, same plutocracy for oligarch outcome. Neither will change a thing for average Americans but will keep selling out for the current and long standing, corporate coup d'tat.
19 | Patricia Cook | 1 | 1557921600894531_1559999397353418 | Let me finish. And Russia should not be influencing the United States elections. So I will never read WilkLeaks stolen info on Hillary.
20 | Jason Carlson | 1 | 1557921600894531_1559885867364771 | The Clinton campaign and its associates sought out underage children for “entertainment” at a hot tub party and made strange references to “hot dogs” and “Beanie Babies” in emails which may contain code for pedophilia or other illegal activities, according to investigative researchers.
21 | Karen Keating | 1 | 1557921600894531_1559918920694799 | although I'm not a resident of Utah, I can say I admire his positions

23 | Alexander Romanioli | 7 | 1557921600894531_1559782260708465 | I don't mind him taking Utah, ID and NE. Do us all a favor.
24 | John Walker | 1 | 1557921600894531_1559830737370284 | Would love to see him siphon *just* enough votes away from Trump that Clinton wins Utah :)
25 | Eric Mann | 3 | 1557921600894531_1559794334040591 | Oh look at me and my protest vote...maybe some day it will make a difference just maybe...

In its final live episode before Election Day, "Saturday Night Live" took the opportunity to get in a few extra jabs at each candidate's expense before taking a surprising turn to break the fourth wall.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mike Hutchisson | 208 | 1343884715707777_1343895612373354 | The differences between Hillary and Trump are too great to ignore. Our next president will either fight climate change or ignore it; will either raise the minimum wage or oppose it; will fight for immigration reform or build a wall. Either Hillary or Trump will be our next president. Too many people's lives are at stake to risk a Trump presidency.
2 | Susan Welch Olevson | 59 | 1343884715707777_1343906372372278 | Go Hillary!!! 🎈🎈🎈come Wednesday we will be rid of Trump and can begin trying to repair all the damage Trump has caused in this country. He has created hate and fear and now it is time for all of us to come together and make America great again. Once Hillary is elected the rest of the world can breathe a sigh of relief 🇺🇸
3 | Eileen Tharp | 28 | 1343884715707777_1343886519040930 | Why did Bill Clinton receive $1,000,000 for his birthday from Quatar? Maybe his wife Secretary of State could tell us. Gee, if we stop oil and gas exploration in the U.S. maybe we could start giving more money to the middle east again. Clintons= Crooks.
4 | Benjamin Nelson | 16 | 1343884715707777_1343895405706708 | I have hope in both candidates. One of them will win. I pray that each one, no matter who wins, has good health and good judgement when elected and sworn into office. Politics divide us. Lets see beyond the divide and shine light on what we all have in common. God Bless The United States of America.
5 | Suzanne Potts | 9 | 1343884715707777_1343933179036264 | Notice in the clip how Kate has Hillary campaign signs behind her and Alec has nothing. No Trump signs. They can't tell us who to vote for but it's nice to know they're clearly on the side of sanity. 👍🏼
6 | Frank Hy | 2 | 1343884715707777_1344086145687634 | Make America great again: Vote democrat in every race!!! Democrats must win the house and senate and keep control for many years to keep republicans from more years of obstructing and witch hunts. Hillary/Kaine 2016!!!!!!!!
7 | Dustin J Davis Olson | 6 | 1343884715707777_1343932565702992 | Those voting for Hillary Clinton, defending Clinton and supporting Clinton without reading the information reported by WikiLeaks are intellectually no different than those who criticize climate science without ever having read the science. In short, if you defend Clinton and ignore WikiLeaks, you have something in common with Sarah Palin. Let that sink in for a moment. Finished processing that? Now process this — if the journalists responsible for reporting on Watergate were labeled “Russian sympathizers,” charged by the media as “attempting to influence an election,” and banned from travel or communication access, how would history judge the event? This is exactly what has happened to Julian Assange, who has done more for journalism than any of these corporate-owned, brand-named media products have done this election cycle. Either you support access to information or you have a problem with an informed public. Which side are you on?
8 | Terry Wunsch | 5 | 1343884715707777_1343913662371549 | New York Post just reported Hillary Clinton had her maid print and fax classified information! Is that someone you want as president, I don't think so. She should be in jail! Even left wing liberal nut Chris Mathews came out against Clinton, that should speak volumes to all you liberals who are stupid enough to vote for a criminal like Clinton! Be smart and vote for Donald Trump for President!!!
9 | Kerry Senchyna | 5 | 1343884715707777_1343937959035786 | The SNL episode reminds me of the Chaplin film The Great Dictator where the Hitler character (in actuality a mistaken identity) makes a speech about Hitlerism and how we should include and not divide, how we should love and not hate. It is one of the great speeches of all-time made on the eve of WWII and SNL got the flavour of it. Nicely done

No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.
11 | Darren Neal | 4 | 1343884715707777_1343934755702773 | This election is just as much about Barack Obama as it is Hillary Clinton. Their main platform is attacking Trump's character. Trump has real ideas that will move our country forward - on the economy, on foreign trade, on healthcare competition, on the war against ISIS, on securing borders...Hillary has no plan. She is NOT innovative. She will not make this huge difference that she says she will. She needs A listers to drag her over the finish line.
12 | Charles John Klaus | 2 | 1343884715707777_1343935355702713 | In the deepest sense, a heart-breaking sketch, as the bile and vitriol of the campaign effervesced and became a magically altered state of peace, happiness and freedom. Thus is comedy revealed to be the tough covering of tender hearts...
13 | H Jake Broomes | 1 | 1343884715707777_1343933462369569 | I recognized the Hitler play book early. There is only one option here...fleeing. He has made the election irrelevant for his people. "Make me King and kill or imprison our enemies" is his mantra.
14 | Francis DiCarlo | 1 | 1343884715707777_1344368195659429 | REASONS TO NOT VOTE HILLARY⚠️If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?👁⚠️If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.👁⚠️If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.👁⚠️If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.👁⚠️If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.👁⚠️If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.👁⚠️If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?👁⚠️If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? 👁
15 | James Carol Dodson | 0 | 1343884715707777_1343927605703488 | I still say they ought to swap Trump for Alec Baldwin. If Hillary doesn't win at least we'd end up with a Liberal Republican ( at least while he's wearing his Trump get up)
16 | Dave Appel | 0 | 1343884715707777_1344908382272077 | Mike Hutchisson - can you tell the American public what immigration reform is? Everyone uses the words "immigration reform" but does anyone know what they represent and mean? Please enlighten us.
17 | Lynda Hilburn | 16 | 1343884715707777_1343887445707504 | They were too subtle. The Trump folks probably didn't get the overall point.
18 | Bill ONeal | 1 | 1343884715707777_1343992735696975 | A funny bit would be where Hillary is using foundation money to pay for Chelsea's wedding! Or even better where her maid is printing off classified material for her! That would be funny!
19 | Mandy Briscoe | 0 | 1343884715707777_1344001249029457 | Too bad in real life people still can't be civil and unite without having to boast upon who is the better most faithful American. Patriot!
20 | Rhonda Morales | 0 | 1343884715707777_1344084979021084 | Who gives a rats butt about climate change. We will be at war before long and that is what will matter if Hillary is elected.
21 | Naomi Haas | 1 | 1343884715707777_1343946195701629 | Based on definition below, Donnie Drumpf should be tried for treason as he aids and comforts our enemies every time he opens his mouth.

23 | Ramon Cordero | 0 | 1343884715707777_1344131885683060 | So much for the so called emails scandal. Republicans were trying to find anything to see what sticks. Get over it. You got nothing on her now. She is a good person and will be your next president. Trump is a hateful, racist, arrogant, person and will never be our president. Americans want someone that represent our values. Trump does not live up to those values.
24 | John Rice | 0 | 1343884715707777_1343920395704209 | A House DividedA cold wind is blowing, blowing over towering snow topped mountains, across the breadth and depth of the prairie lands, sweeping through the eastern seaboard, chilling everything in its path, from the Canadian border, to the Gulf of Mexico, stealing away hope, peace, common sense, kindness, love of neighbor, reason, with every puff of its bitter breath, and leaving hate, despair, anger and rage in its wake. It seems as if a great evil sword, wielded by some giant maniacal hand or a scythe held fast by the grim reaper has divided America in two, split the peoples of the land into left and right, without hope of any common ground. The great experiment in a republic, in a democratic way of life has become a house divided. Not since the civil war has there been so much bitterness, so much vitriolic rhetoric hurled at one and another.To my mind, a politician is supposed to bridge the abyss, reach out across great chasms, unite, not divide, bring together not separate, but in this election year, the two candidates warring for control of the White House have done the opposite. Instead of discussing the issues of the day, instead of coming up with a workable plan to deal with climate change, unemployment, with the fading middle class, they seem more at ease in telling everyone why they shouldn’t vote for their opponent, instead of giving anyone a reason to vote for them.The one thing that worries me, is if America falls from its place in the world, falls from grace, the rest of the countries will go down the drain with it.A house dividedcannot stand,for it is likeit was notbuilt upon a rock,but instead placed on a tinyspit of sand.When the stormgathers it’s might,and great wavescome crashing,come roaring in upon the shore,the house divided,will bea house no more.
