370 economists pen open letter denouncing Donald J. Trump, saying he "has misled the electorate" and is "dangerous, destructive choice for the country."

4 | Adam Lasales | 327 | 10154971315458812_10154971320373812 | She's corrupt, she cheated in the debates, she took millions of dollars from foreign investors in pay to play scandals, she has dozens of mysterious murders and suicides in her inner circle, but she's a woman, so she must be ok to vote for. #Hillary for Prison 2016
5 | Kevin Watson | 219 | 10154971315458812_10154971328623812 | Hillary also has the funds behind her to pay off 370 economists to pen those letters also. Get that through you thick hypocritical skulls also. #DrainTheSwamp

8 | Clo Rodeffer | 78 | 10154971315458812_10154971328863812 | Trump‚Äôs casino bankruptcies, which left investors holding the bag while he skedaddled with their money    Trump‚Äôs habit of refusing to pay contractors who had done work for him, many of whom are struggling small businesses    Trump University, which includes not only the people who got scammed and the Florida investigation, but also a similar story from Texas where the investigation into Trump U was quashed.    The Trump Institute, another get-rich-quick scheme in which Trump allowed a couple of grifters to use his name to bilk people out of their money    The Trump Network, a multi-level marketing venture (a.k.a. pyramid scheme) that involved customers mailing in a urine sample which would be analyzed to produce for them a specially formulated package of multivitamins    Trump Model Management, which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U.S. illegally, and kept them in squalid conditions while they earned almost nothing for the work they did    Trump‚Äôs employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts, which involves a claim that he can‚Äôt find Americans to do the work    Trump‚Äôs use of hundreds of undocumented workers from Poland in the 1980s, who were paid a pittance for their illegal work    Trump‚Äôs history of being charged with housing discrimination    Trump‚Äôs connections to mafia figures involved in New York construction    The time Trump paid the Federal Trade Commission $750,000 over charges that he violated anti-trust laws when trying to take over a rival casino company    The fact that Trump is now being advised by Roger Ailes, who was forced out as Fox News chief when dozens of women came forward to charge him with sexual harassment. According to the allegations, Ailes‚Äôs behavior was positively monstrous; as just one indicator, his abusive and predatory actions toward women were so well-known and so loathsome that in 1968 the morally upstanding folks in the Nixon administration refused to allow him to work there despite his key role in getting Nixon elected.

If you want to go back to the days of MLK then #VoteTrump, if you're a bigot #VoteTrump, if you don't care about this country #VoteTrump, if you want your children to live in a torn up country #VoteTrump, if you have no soul/values #VoteTrump. I know this country was founded on Laws but no man is here 'Lawfully' with the those Laws written by Native American blood.

23 | Steve Cavaliere | 2 | 10154971315458812_10154971374653812 | Actually there is a lot of truth to people saying that these "experts" were paid off to be negative.

Notice they had to water that sound bite down to "climate change"?Abc is part of the problem by spreading around fertilizer without a warning label for the impressionable.

24 | Ellie Rodal | 6 | 10154971315458812_10154971379603812 | So tell me all those brilliant people where have you been, cause you have not done a damn thing to try and fix the economy...  Whatever Trump has is better than what you guys have pedaled for all these years.
25 | Moni Kumar | 2 | 10154971315458812_10154971346313812 | All economists who said Trump is dangerous because they know he don't allowed them to be smart at all and Hillary will give them access to Clinton foundation and others major business while they can save billions of$$$$

14 | Lauri Smith | 0 | 10154971313093812_10154971316048812 | My car was hit in the front driver's side wheel on Oct. 11, 2016 in Resterstown MD. The guy that hit my car toke full responsible for the accident. His insurance company Allstate totaled my vehicle on Friday Oct.14, 2016. A REPERSENTATIVE Called at 2:00pm and stated they total my car I would need to get the rental back by Tuesday, Oct. 18, 2016. And would give me last than blue book value for my car.  Now All State wants me to pay storage fees (out on a settlement that was a joke in the first place.) for a car that was towed; knowing I had no way of getting to without a vehicle. Its not enough money to get a lawer.  Any advise for girl.

Turnout among African-American voters in Florida and North Carolina, key early-voting states, may be cause for concern for Hillary Clinton.

1 | Taylor Brad | 111 | 10154971261283812_10154971272388812 | Democrats use minorities for votes, keep conditions bad on purpose to stoke anger to motivate them to show up to the polls when they need them to vote!!Most of the lowest income urban minority communities have voted democrat for 30+ yrs and have nothing to show for itü§î
2 | Billy Shoff | 60 | 10154971261283812_10154971274653812 | Of course it is. They see the corruption inside the Democratic Party for what it is. Liberals think too lowly of blacks. They are your average American too and will not be pandered to by some lying corrupt criminal.
3 | James Martin | 33 | 10154971261283812_10154971295548812 | Maybe they finally figured out that Hilary, and democrats in general, care about minorities up until voting day. After that they're on their own.
4 | Kevin Washington | 37 | 10154971261283812_10154971278208812 | Why? Cause we didn't go for her down home pandering and Tabasco sauce endorsement down heya on da Chitlin circuit?We see right through her bull.Half of us know someone serving time for ridiculous reasons under twice as long sentences as other races, cause she and her husband needed to do something bout us "super predators."Good luck with calling us home to the plantation.
5 | Donna Lowry Theus | 16 | 10154971261283812_10154971319598812 | Some of you people need help. It's not about Hillary, it's about the Democratic Party, which on any given day is better than the Republican Party, trump is a piece of vial garbage
6 | Lisa Burke | 15 | 10154971261283812_10154971310023812 | We're going to show up! Let's vote people! Go to the poll or turn in those absentee ballots! Don't believe the hype. We know better!
7 | Tonia Janette | 11 | 10154971261283812_10154971307613812 | I don't know why you seem to think black people are only going to vote for Hillary what has the democratic party done for them I think they are plenty out there that are willing to give Trump a try.
8 | Sarah Gomez | 10 | 10154971261283812_10154971313078812 | Many people prefer to vote on election day for various reasons. I am hoping the percentage of these voters are among this group.
9 | Danny Dranger | 15 | 10154971261283812_10154971271773812 | see the stock market dropping cuz of trumo? all u idiots are gonna lose jobs when his election will cause a world recession. u got yrseives to blame.
10 | David M. Beyer | 5 | 10154971261283812_10154971298213812 | Not to be obvious, but Hillary is white. The heavy turn out was for a black man. They were proud to vote for him. Hillary just another political figure who doesn't mean anything to them.
11 | Dave Parker | 6 | 10154971261283812_10154971287953812 | I'd say black folks finally figured out that Democrats just pay them lip service to get their votes and then throw them a few crumbs to appease them. Why would they expect anything from Hillary when OBAMA did nothing in eight years for them.
12 | Eileen Finn | 0 | 10154971261283812_10154971448583812 | Obviously they're not as ignorant as Clinton assumes they are. Minorities are looked on as being uneducated and will do anything for a dime, but it would surprise everyone how many minorities are educated and have their own minds. Clinton and her cronies are all a bunch of losers.
13 | Davis Emeribe | 0 | 10154971261283812_10154971335888812 | This is what all the fake medias like CNN, ABC, etc are hidden for the people to know, hillary Clinton make bill Clinton to refuse to acknowledge his son just because the mother was a black, any black that vote for hillary Clinton is an idiot and a fool, all they needs is black votes blacks life's don't means anything to them or matters to them, how long can we be used like a peace of paper, if you are a black then think about this, refused to be used, say the change begins with me and Trump is the change and not Clinton
14 | Don Grey | 2 | 10154971261283812_10154971330988812 | This is what I don't get. People want change, but they'll sit on their butts when they could do something about it. Here is your chance and they'll wonder why it gets worse when Trump gets elected. Get off your asses and VOTE!
15 | Scott Cole | 0 | 10154971261283812_10154971460418812 | 'Close your eyes and imagine: you are a mother of 3 boys. Your oldest baby, tall, blonde headed, very kind, and whose name is Chris, makes you so proud. He graduates the University of California, later goes on to help others in the Peace Corps, teaching English in Morocco, and there develops a passion to help in the Middle East. He goes on to law school, then joins the Foreign Service so he can serve his great country as our foreign diplomat in Libya. Hillary Clinton swears him in for his post there. Things are good, then militants uprise there and want revenge on Americans for the death of Moammar Gadhafi. Your son asks for help from Clinton, who has just sworn him in there 4 months earlier, not once or twice, but 600 times. Hillary and Obama send NO AID, Marines are only 3 hrs. away. Your son and his friends are held up in the compound, which is then set afire. Your son is now dragged out onto the street ALIVE, raped, sodomized, brutalized, and murdered. Now, open your eyes, and tell me how you can even vote for Hillary Clinton!!Trump may be vulgar, he may not know how to control his mouth, but his actions haven't killed Americans. I would rather have a Nebuchadnezzar in office than an evil Jezebel......Now that your eyes are opened here's the REAL story...........Amb. Stevens was sent to the Benghazi post in haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the fictitious talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers.Copied and pasted...and pasted again and again and again until everyone reads this truth.... GO TRUMP....
16 | Iris Coleman | 0 | 10154971261283812_10154971444093812 | You damn sure can't believe Trump is for the minorities. If was left up to him an some of his followers they would put us back to salivary days. It is really scary to thinks this man has gotten this far for the things he has said.

19 | Karen Wood Davis | 1 | 10154971261283812_10154971320733812 | I personally think they don't understand that they need to vote to have their voice heard, and don't do the work - like get a picture ID.  The last few years, the mantra has been that picture ID was put in place to keep them from voting, but no, it came about after 9/11.

You either want a country with safe, secure borders or you don't. You either want a robust economy & more JOBS or you don't.You either want safe neighborhoods or you don't.You either want to defeat radical Islamic terrorism or you don't.You either want school choice or you don't. You either want a strong National defense system or you don't. You either want to keep the right to bear arms (& protect yourself) or you don't.You either want better & less expensive healthcare or you don't.You either want a candidate who wants to be President of the People or you want the candidate of the Wealthy Elites.You either want a CORRUPT FREE government or you are happy with the corruptness at every level (FBI, DoJ etc).You either believe a child has rights even 1 minute before they're born or you don't think a child has rights until after they're born. You either want the first US female President to be honest, trustworthy, and patriotic or you want her to be the most corrupt person to ever run for POTUS, morally bankrupt, who put America up for sale, & has disdain and contempt for all hard-working Americans! Hillary Clinton has lied and cheated her entire life! Voting for her is ANTI-AMERICAN! For the future first woman President, I'm picturing someone like Jackie Kennedy or Nancy Reagan, not this evil woman.
22 | Norma Jay | 1 | 10154971261283812_10154971280038812 | Want them to vote? Then where are the churches and clubs with the buses to take to them polls by the bus loads? Those are the types of people who aren't voting. Folks died so they could vote and they decided not to. Just shameful!!!
23 | Andrea Reichling | 0 | 10154971261283812_10154971376333812 | Why is it that going after the white vote is racist for the Republican Party , but going after the black vote is an acceptable way for democrats to guarantee a White House win?
24 | Elizabeth Marshall | 0 | 10154971261283812_10154971460623812 | Democrats use minorities for votes and never deliver on any of the promises that they make to them during election season. STOP voting for arrogant white liberals who have done nothing for you for three straight decades.

Two Iowa police officers were slain in the line of duty this morning; one was a married Sgt. with children, and the other was an officer in his 20's, just beginning a career in law enforcement.

Why won‚Äôt Donald Trump say ‚Äúradical white terrorism?‚Äù Is he part of a larger white supremacist terror group? We need to put a stop to white men entering this country until we can figure out what the hell is going on.
2 | Jennifer Ca | 264 | 10154971156398812_10154971173063812 | This is the direct result of Trump's racist rhetoric and if he wins will be a common occurrence. Disagree with someone, you get punched in the face or shot. It has to stop.
3 | Jimmy Agosto | 141 | 10154971156398812_10154971192518812 | But according to Trump mexicans are the rapists and murderers. He wants to build a wall to keep all the criminals out,the criminals are already in this country smh

5 | Sandy Dominguez | 115 | 10154971156398812_10154971194523812 | Sad that our country has come down to blaming a presidential candidate for a evil act.  ( I am in no way a Trump Supporter.) These men lost their lives because an idiot isnt mentally stable and that sad. Prayers for the families of these two brave men. Ive had plenty of comments making this a race issue. I dont care what color of skin you have. A life is a life and if someone ends another persons life because of a mans words, well in my eyes he is mentally unstable.
6 | Geri Rogers Rochon | 69 | 10154971156398812_10154971218938812 | RIP to these 2 police heroes. So..instead of blaming this on everybody in the universe...how about we blame it on suspected gunman, 46-year-old Scott Michael Greene? I believe it was Greene who was the actual  KILLER!!!! SMH

This should NOT be an argument about liberals or conservatives! We are American and human and do not believe in murdering innocent people. My friends: Trump supporters, Hillary supporters, left-wing, right-wing, Libertarian, Green...ALL find this tragic. Media, I hope you start being fair in your reporting and start showing the good these officers do. You portray them as monsters and have turned these good men, women, fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters into targets!

13 | Tracy Gayhart Scrafford Rivera | 14 | 10154971156398812_10154971270293812 | How is it that we have become so insensitive as Americans, yes, Americans, not whites, or blacks, or browns, or Reds, or yellows, but Americans, that we have to argue over what fricken color the shooter is and what color the cops are??? And which presidential candidate is at fault for this??? Or blaming our current president?? How about taking some of the blame ourselves, racists hypocrites.  When most of us were kids, we looked up to the police. We wanted to be police. And don't say, "no we didnt!". Everyone crying BLM, KKK, "whiteys this", "black people that". Aren't some of you SICK of it??? And don't start with the police killings blacks, or black on black, or "police kill more whites" in those whiney voices, because actually, it's getting OLD!!!  We made our own problems, and we HEAR them more because why?? Social media. News. Facebook. Do you really think things like this didn't go on when you were young? Pick up old newspapers. I mean older than you. Read them. Yes. Crap happened. Even before we were spoiled rotten people crying about every little incident. Stop crying racism and feeling sorry for yourselves, and seriously think about what these officers, and others, yes, even ALL races killed by police officers or by ANYONE,  think about their families. Think what their little kids or older children, their spouses, their parents, think about what they are going through, and stop thinking of pitying yourselves. Start HELPING yourselves.

15 | Linda Bunbury Meadors | 2 | 10154971156398812_10154971323733812 | Over a freaking treasonous flag. Really. Now two families have their holidays and lives ruined. This is what happens when Trump uses rhetoric that encourages asses like this to take matters into their own hands. I hope you're punished to the fullest  extent of the law because you felt that a treasonous flag was worth more than the lives of these two men.
16 | Irene Dodds Bukovecz | 18 | 10154971156398812_10154971257158812 | I'm so sick of all of you turning this into a political thing! These officers lost their lives while trying to maintain law and order in this country. They deserve respect and appreciation! Smh... #bluelivesmatter!
17 | Jan Parris | 6 | 10154971156398812_10154971305698812 | What is wrong with you people? Two men died today. One with a family and the other just starting his life. You guys are what's wrong with this world have a little respect. Leave the politics out of this.
18 | Amber Cassidy Sikes | 4 | 10154971156398812_10154971264183812 | Regardless of their color or job, both of these men have a family, one has kids and they both innocently lost their lives. Being disrespectful of their loss is just as bad as the rude, selfish, racist, people who were hateful when a mother lost her son or a child lost their father when their innocent  lives were taken by cops. Two wrongs don't a make a right and a persons job or race doesn't mean that they deserve to die.

My heart is so very sad with what's going on with our country. No respect for human life. My thoughts & prayers go out to the family of these two wonderful officers. May God give them the strength during this very difficult time. Rest In Peace. I hope this piece of garbage, who killed these two officers, gets the death penalty, as he should.

24 | Keith Kearns | 9 | 10154971156398812_10154971254453812 | I can't for the life of me understand why people do things like this. Are there bad cops out there?....unfortunately yes but they are outnumbered by good honest cops who at the end of the day are no diffrent than the guy or gal who punches out from the factory or the corner store. It's a job and not an easy one at that but still just a job to feed and house their families.  Rest in peace officers. to all the families who lost a brother or sister in blue my heart goes out to you stay safe and stay vigilant
25 | Deb Vaughn | 3 | 10154971156398812_1089107677871933 | The families of these men / officers (not "cops") have asked that you NOT politicize this tragedy. So if you really "stand with them",  all of you, on every side of every political fence, just shut up about that political crap.

1 | Christina Sisneros | 31 | 10154971030043812_10154971113983812 | What you all need to understand is the Native Americans were here first and their beliefs are just that and no should think that their beliefs are more important! !!
2 | Dianna L. Mathis | 41 | 10154971030043812_10154971048673812 | Maybe if the protestors went and stood on their grandparents graves (of the officers in riot gear), yelling and mocking at them they'd actually get the point that they are dishonoring sacred ground.  NO one likes it when you dishonor and disrespect them, their family or their values but just don't see it when that is exactly what they are doing to these people.
3 | Pauline Ritchey | 10 | 10154971030043812_10154971156253812 | People who say its a waste of time what these protesters are doing . and this land does not belong to them ... You need to go read history again .. And then come back and talk . and then think of this whatever religion you follow what if someone when onto your land or went to a cemetery where your relatives are buried and started digging it up what would you do .... They have a right to fight for what's theirs protect sacred lands if I could I would be right there with them this is a fight I believe in
4 | Steven Velez | 15 | 10154971030043812_10154971088678812 | DAPl using their people to infiltrate the Peaceful Protesters & trying to instigate violence! Shame North Dakota law enforcement & national Guard for protecting the wrong side!#NoDAPL
5 | Michelle Jo | 8 | 10154971030043812_10154971068708812 | FINALLY NATIONAL COVERAGE!  I agree Dianna, shall we go to Arlington? It's deplorable what the government is doing and allowing. Yet, it's election time.... SMH
6 | Brian Caldwell | 10 | 10154971030043812_10154971085203812 | It's odd how it's politically incorrect to have a sports team named after native Americans but the Govt finds it just fine to take their sacred land from them. Hmmm.
7 | Frank Day | 1 | 10154971030043812_10154971263763812 | How about a report on how DAPL is using instigators to promote that the protectors are violent?There are dozens of professionals there at the camp, and a few interviews with them would open eyes about what lengths this oil company is resorting too is outrageous.
8 | Marybeth Buse | 5 | 10154971030043812_10154971105193812 | Ashamed of my country, and the way the protesters were treated dogs, mace, pepper spray, clubs, reminded me of the civil rights protesters years ago. We sure never learn.
9 | Cara Hill | 4 | 10154971030043812_10154971319703812 | What the media forgets to tell you is that is that the land has been surveyed and they have done tests, and even consulted with the local tribe, that is not sacred land....that is private land owned by the farmers in the area. Also, the police haven't done anything wrong, the police have not used deadly force (even after they were fired upon) they are simply removing the protestors who are on private land. And when they go back to their camp, they are left alone. I live 10 miles from where this is happening, it's not what the media makes it to be. I understand why they are protesting, but for all you that don't know (because the media leaves alot out) is that this is not a peaceful protest. I fully believe in a peaceful protest, and I love that we have that right....but this is far from peaceful!
10 | Windy Wolf | 0 | 10154971030043812_10154971416198812 | The Native Americans do nwit want the pipeline built here because a spill could contaminate their existung water supply...their sacred grounds...and we all know the government always takes more land than originally bargained. They fear the threat of a 'spill' desecrating their property...not the pipeline!
11 | Are Dee | 1 | 10154971030043812_10154971258353812 | buy your own riot gear on amazon/ buy drones with cameras/ sound amplafiying guns to spy on them. and get those reflective blankets to mess with there heat sensors/ get your own heat sensors. and polar bear fur blocks it too
12 | Angelia Foy | 0 | 10154971030043812_10154971421328812 | I pray You both can come to a peaceful ending to this situation. Remember also those police and military are only doing what they are ordered to do. It's not them personally against the indians
13 | Brenda Tillery Huffman | 0 | 10154971030043812_10154971475838812 | If the police were not out of control why would the Dept. of Justice, Amnesty International and the U.N. be there?  These  human beings are being beaten, maced and peppered sprayed beyond human endurance, shot in the face with rubber bullets, their horses shot ( one so severely that it had to be put down ), they are having their eagle feathers and other sacred items torn from their hands, they are being stripped searched on trumped up charges and thrown in prison and dog kennels ( yep, there are pictures of that ), their arms are being numbered ( remember Hitler"s regime?) , unlicensed goons working for DAPL turned loose dogs on them, journalists have been arrested and throw in jail on charges of inciting a riot....a least the judge threw those charges out and the list goes on and on. All of you who have such hate in your heart need to search your soul and realize that no other ethnic group would ever be treated in such a horrible and inhumane way and get away with it.  Ask yourself, why would police from 5 states, national guard and private goons be called in to protect big co-operations when they are supposed to protect and serve the people of this country.  The 1% who own this country are busy, busy, busy destroying this nation.
14 | Robert Harris | 2 | 10154971030043812_10154971152943812 | Dead is dead, a grave is a hole in the ground. The bones in the hole don't mind if you stand on top of them. The pipeline is totally on private property, and will not harm the river in any way. Just keep digging the protesters will move or else.
15 | Gloria Schmitz | 3 | 10154971030043812_10154971171188812 | Am I the only one that doesn't understand that private means private?  And when someone went to court to purchase this land, then it must be registered with the state. So, who's violating whom?

17 | Laney Briggs | 4 | 10154971030043812_10154971086393812 | Police are protecting corporate interests..shameful. One candidate has invested in the pipeline. Check it out.
18 | Robert Alan | 0 | 10154971030043812_10154971067508812 | Is there something more sacred about an Indian grave than a white, black, or Latino grave. Please enlighten us oh ABC propaganda machine. I thought you guys were atheists. Do you believe in Indian spirituality?
19 | Julio Garcia | 1 | 10154971030043812_10154971338473812 | VOTE TRUMP!!! RANT ALERT!!! If you have the right to vote. please do so, as many people residing in the U.S. cannot. This man is a monster and will probably start WWIII to say the least. I know Hillary is not perfect, but at least we know she has what it takes to lead this great nation. If you want to go back to the days of MLK then #VoteTrump, if you're a bigot #VoteTrump, if you don't care about this country #VoteTrump, if you want your children to live in a torn up country #VoteTrump, if you have no soul/values #VoteTrump. I know this country was founded on Laws but no man is here 'Lawfully' with the those Laws written by Native American blood. If we follow the laws of god and have basic morals we would have no problem with our neighbors. We would embrace them instead regardless of orientation, religion, disability, and race. I'm done talking about this bigot as he is wasting my time and energy. Again if you can vote go vote, but remember that your vote can either keep the world as is, or make is 100 times worse. God Bless!
20 | Glen Perkin | 4 | 10154971030043812_10154971103088812 | Tell these moronic protestors that everything changes, nothing stays the same. The modern World is moving forward with or without them.

An Urbandale police officer and a Des Moines police officer were found shot in their patrol vehicles a few miles away from each other in the Des Moines area. One was pronounced dead at the scene and the other died at a local hospital.

7 | Juanita Brown | 12 | 10154970871953812_10154971084508812 | This is why!!Why is Russia so interested in keeping Assad in power?I have asked many influential people and they did not have an answer,Yesterday I received the answer.President Obama and Clinton were planning to build an oil pipeline from Turkey to Qatar. They were going to make a 'killing' on this deal. Literally billions of dollars. Now this is where the snag popped up. Assad did not like the pipeline passing through Syria (not sure if he was not offered enough to like it or any other reason for him being against it). The deal was stuck.The solution was to get rid of Assad and so Obama and Clinton decided to start an Arab spring in Syria, as that was the trend in the rest of the Arab world at that time. the USA encouraged rebels to take up arms and started a revolution to get rid of Assad. The plan nearly worked, but Russia cam into the picture as she did not want this deal to go through. So Russia intervened and saved Assad from assured destruction.Now this deal could now also explain the millions of dollars the Qatar has donated over the years to the Clinton foundation.Now Iran is also involved in this deal. She was supposed to benefit greatly from this pipe line as she was going to be one of the main suppliers of this oil that was to be pumped to Qatar. Now we see that Iran has a very big vested interest in our region and stood to make billions annually from it.At the beginning of the year, America, under the orders of Obama, transferred 1.7 billion dollars in CASH to the Iranians. It was made out to be some type of ransom, for the 4 Americans being held there at that time. This seems now to not be the truth. This money was made out to be ransom money, but it was money due to Iran according to the pipe line agreement and this was a cover for this transaction. Money was in reality being stolen by the Clintons and Obama, and used for their personal interests. CRIMINAL.And what about the resulting civil war in the region, that was to topple Assad. hundreds of thousands of people had been killed as a result, and million have been left homeless and refugees. This could be the reason why Clinton wants to allow so many of the Syrian refugees into America.There is more to come, and the information that I am receiving, is now putting many pieces of the puzzle together and the picture is becoming very clear. These people, Obama and the Clintons have destroyed the decent world over greed for themselves. Human lives have not been part of the equation. Money was the prize, and it was going to be got at all costs.Oh and another point was written and agreed on. If Obama was to be charged, Clinton, being President was supposed to grant him a pardon, shortly later.Can you sleep tonight? I certainly cannot, knowing there is the slightest possibility that Clinton could be elected President, and these evil plans and cover-ups could continue.Wikileaks will fill us in on all the information needed, before and I'm sure after the elections. Internal investigations are continuing by them.More to follow.....
8 | Matt Sheehan | 12 | 10154970871953812_10154970998378812 | Don't vote for a candidate that denies climate change! This is EVERYONES problem! You might not be with her but she acknowledges our biggest issue. All the other squabbling doesn't matter in the slightest.
9 | Cheryl Carlin House | 10 | 10154970871953812_10154971177793812 | I am curious who is paying for the Obamas to travel around the country and for security? Since I am definitely not voting for Clinton, it better not be our tax money. If it is, we would all like to see a total cost for this and Clinton needs to foot the bill.
10 | Gary Mattox | 6 | 10154970871953812_10154971122358812 | Campaigning and giving full support for a corrupt criminal running for President that is the subject of yet another federal investigation and a possible indictment looming. Speaks volumes about our current President who could care less about America as a whole country of hard working people and families.
11 | Jaime Chaton | 4 | 10154970871953812_10154971258903812 | He's a douche who disrespects the desires of large number of people who are supporting Trump. These people want Trump because he's not a career politician who magically becomes a millionaire while being a public servant. Trump is already a billionaire who wants that change as well.
12 | Michael Rodriguez | 17 | 10154970871953812_10154970899368812 | White people your Obama hate train is so played out!!! Get over it he is loved by more people than hated. Y'all wanna cry about race baiting and other things while you passionately hated this man for 8 years solely based on lies.
13 | Robert Mayes | 9 | 10154970871953812_10154971031138812 | Unparalleled for a sitting president to be campaigning for someone under a federal investigation, but if Clinton isn't elected Obama might share a cell with her.
14 | Paul D Smith | 7 | 10154970871953812_10154970999078812 | Because she doesn't stand a hope of winning without milking some of the positive political capital that President Obama has built up.  And he knows that the only hope of his house of cards continuing to stand after he is gone is if Hillary wins - every other possible candidate in the election will dismantle much, if not all, of the poorly planned and ill-implemented flawed programs of his Administration.  He needs her to win as much as she needs him to help her attempt to win.
15 | KC-Jeremy Carnes | 1 | 10154970871953812_10154971283313812 | I don't know how she can be running if she is being investigated again by the FBI. I guess it just goes to show how messed up this country has become with all the corruption in the government. It's funny how at first she wouldn't be great and now Obama is all for her! Corruption at its finest
16 | Ronald Hammon | 1 | 10154970871953812_10154971319763812 | Obama said she wasn't qualified to be dog catcher, Michelle said you can't keep your own house in order much less the peoples house, he wants her to finish destroying America and take us in to the new world order under un control ?
17 | Bonnie Verworn | 3 | 10154970871953812_10154971027863812 | Should be illegal to use taxpayers money ., the jet and who is doing the presidents job .. her running mate should get equal money for his campaign .
18 | Jeanne Ellenwood | 1 | 10154970871953812_1779560902292730 | As if his words carry any weight...His performance as President is dismal at best. Weak and corrupted...as well as a damn liar. Prison strips are gonna look great on you, Hillary and the rest of her mob...
19 | Maria Saldana | 28 | 10154970871953812_10154970898328812 | B'c he doesn't want to go to prison... and Hildebeest can sell him Scalias' empty seat.  Both deserve what they have coming to them.
20 | Tim Coyle | 3 | 10154970871953812_10154971047963812 | He needs to have some class, step aside, and let these candidates do their thing. I don't like the idea of any outgoing president, regardless of party, going out and stumping for their party's candidate. When Bush was on his way out, he stepped aside and let the candidates have the show. When Clinton was on his way out, he stepped aside and let the candidates have the show. I can't ever remember a president doing what Obama is doing. I'm just not a fan of it.
21 | David Kane | 2 | 10154970871953812_10154971326053812 | Her and Obama have both sold out this country hillary for personal wealth Obama because he's a Muslim and hates America why else would you give a terrorist nation 150 billion dollars.
22 | Cj Juarez | 1 | 10154970871953812_10154971277368812 | Its called class and team work, something Hillary Clinton knows nothing about and Barrak Obama does... Now move on into the sunset. Trumps coming in and we are going to clean house.
23 | Gerald McCarthy Jr | 1 | 10154970871953812_10154971132423812 | Funny how they both have endured so much crap from the Right yet they are still serving our country with grace & dignity. Those words, "grace & dignity" are never associated with D. Twit.
24 | Paul Wonders Hezcalled | 2 | 10154970871953812_10154970995108812 | of the two candidates running for president... Only Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress.

84-year-old man trips would-be thief at a mall in Chile, but takes himself out in the process. The man is okay, except for his wife being mad at him. "She did not speak to me for hours." http://abcn.ws/2eVJVKK

I was never sexist until my wife threw me like a POS and woman harassing men at a work place and HR doing nothing because woman are a quota compared to men. Sorry but I'll be single for the rest of my life. Don't need a woman from today's mentality in my life. Real woman are rare.

Mississippi church that was set on fire and spray painted with 'Vote Trump' is being investigated as a hate crime; ATF, FBI are on scene.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dana Rich | 341 | 10154970689143812_10154970732688812 | Because Trump supporters would write that on a building they just burned. That was certainly Hillary's minions who are dumb enough to think we will fall for it.
2 | Warren Murray | 345 | 10154970689143812_10154970699218812 | This is what everyone but those who are not a part of trumps white extremist group can look forward to if he is elected. They don't back him for his policies, he has none. They back him because he thinks like them.
3 | William T Lorgen | 307 | 10154970689143812_10154970725293812 | Just saw that ABC deleted the most liked comment under this article. It originally said "Clinton camp has been known to incite violence" which is proven fact.
4 | Roger Gaddy | 235 | 10154970689143812_10154970691898812 | Was the Republican headquarters that was bombed by democrats investigated as a hate crime?
5 | Scott Bernard | 64 | 10154970689143812_10154970722433812 | Black voter turnout is low for HRC. Why not stir things up and make it look like a Trump supporter did this? We have proof of the Democrat's using dirty tactics like this, thanks to Project Veritas.
6 | Stephen George | 59 | 10154970689143812_10154970723953812 | These are things ppl of Democratic propensities are actually doing. I'd be careful to cast blame on any particular group at this point. Democrats are definitely getting crafty....or one could say extremely shady.
7 | Richard Pedrick | 88 | 10154970689143812_10154970697598812 | better use of FBI resources than unfounded email allegations the Director cannot back up with objective evidence after 4 days!
8 | Roger Alex Reyes | 52 | 10154970689143812_10154970696078812 | A couple of weeks ago republican office got burned down they blamed the democrats. Now something that seemed done by trump supporters is being blamed by democrats again? ü§îüòÇ
9 | Heidi Smith | 24 | 10154970689143812_10154970737458812 | This makes me incredibly sad.  I hope that those that did this are caught, and sent to jail... absolutely disgusting beyond words.  I am horrified that this elections seems to have brought out so much racism.  Racism is something that we need to recognize and fix, not bring it to the forefront and almost encourage to happen.  This is heartbreaking.
10 | Catherine Scott | 19 | 10154970689143812_10154970787793812 | Can anyone see a place of Worship was destroyed and know it's WRONG no matter what or who would do this?? So this is what the election and candidates and people's opinions has come to. God Help Us America!!!!
11 | Tawanna Williams | 32 | 10154970689143812_10154970737268812 | In the state of Mississippi, I'm not surprised..home to the Klan head quarters!!!
12 | Lynn Piper | 15 | 10154970689143812_10154970785883812 | Hillary had had violent rioters on her payroll for months. Who stands to benefit from this? Hillary. Follow the money. Don't be sheep. Trump is ahead. Expect things like this to happen for the next 6 days. Hunker down and stay safe and Vote on Tuesday to get rid of this murderous Criminal before the FBI does.
13 | John Tanzi | 16 | 10154970689143812_10154970738948812 | oh for crying out loud! 6 days before election and it just so happens a black church gets burned down and says vote trump????
14 | Taylor Seitz | 9 | 10154970689143812_10154970774603812 | This disgusting, reprehensible behavior should deeply offend and outrage any sensible, patriotic citizen. Church burnings were a common tactic of white supremacists under the Jim Crow laws, and the deplorable rise of the alt-right and white nationalism, encouraged by the Trump campaign, is bring back the very evils that MLK and other civil rights leaders fought so hard against. It is extremely important for this plague to be defeated next week, so as to not reopen one of the darkest chapters in American history.
15 | Ethan Fogg | 6 | 10154970689143812_10154971002548812 | How can you call something a hate crime when you don't know the ethnicity of the offender(s)?  I've heard of a case where the Klan vandalized a white neighborhood with anti-white rhetoric in order to gain support. Don't be too quick to judge. Things aren't always as they seem.
16 | Nicholas Williams | 18 | 10154970689143812_10154970721728812 | I would trust PeeWee Herman sitting behind me in a movie theater while out on a date with O J Simpson, drinking at Bill Cosby's bar with Flint Michigan ice cubes, after taking elevator rides with Ray Rice, all while Casey Anthony babysits for me before I would vote for Donald Trump!!!
17 | Diana Richuitti | 13 | 10154970689143812_10154970781573812 | I doubt this was done by Trump supporters. Seems way more likely to be the Democratic way. They are the ones with the majority on Welfare with too much time on their hands. Trump supporters are to busy working multiple jobs to pay for their section 8 housing, food stamps and free medical. Besides Hillary is the one who hates Catholics and Christians. She has been caught paying people to Riot so you do the math.
18 | Ronnie Payne | 2 | 10154970689143812_1860353860842679 | How many times has this happen in Mississippi?this is all voter intimidation. A church fire in Mississippi happen all the time remember the 60s not has change for blacks there for years. For fear of losing their jobs and homesüòû
19 | Holly Brandon | 3 | 10154970689143812_10154971105048812 | My first response was that due to the fact Hillary is an atheist, her supporters burnt the place as a type of warning that if we vote Trump, which we will, this is what we will see more of. Basically a threat.
20 | Jackie Ellis | 3 | 10154970689143812_10154970742558812 | Assaults protestors at rallies, warns there will be acts of violence if Trump loses, says Hillary should be taken out if elected, killed cops today, all acts of Trump supporters, but no this couldn't possibly be done by his supporters gotta be those demsüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
21 | Roger RC Cozine II | 11 | 10154970689143812_10154970764998812 | Probably a Hillary supporter using another underhanded strategy to gain more votes for Hillary. It's the simple yet effective tactic of misdirection
22 | Lydia Sheppard Keiser | 2 | 10154970689143812_1860357104175688 | Ok, so you morons don't think a Trump supporter did this do you? This was done by someone trying to harm Trump... really? NO ONE would spray paint the name of the person they were voting for on the side of a building they set on fire... Don't be stupid....
23 | Kevin Norris | 4 | 10154970689143812_10154970783033812 | Take your pick Republicans...... If you're an "evangelical" you've sold your soul to the anti-Christ..... If you're a good ole boy, you've sold your conscience to the Marquis de Sade..... If you're a woman, you've sold your identity to the Freudian Slip..... If you're young, you've sold your integrity to Voldemort .... And if you're just plain stupid, you have no idea what I've just said, so carry on, still oblivious....
24 | Scott Ital | 0 | 10154970689143812_10154971160353812 | The Democrats will suffer and embarrassing scandal party wide as well as Republicans. This will include media Outlets and donors and special interest groups. The best cards are being saved for last and that reason is you will have no time to recover and no time to replace. Checkmate
25 | John Chafin | 1 | 10154970689143812_10154971119563812 | Probably another paid democrat. Anyone that really wanted trump elected would never do this then write "vote trump". Hillary is desperate now. Pulling out all the stops. Let her. Step one, get into the White House. Step 2 prosecute the criminals in office. Step 3, restore peace and unity with our allies and Russia. Everything will fall in place after.

4 | Zeina Yousef | 0 | 10154970677043812_10154970700908812 | Video: Israeli soldiers throw stones at Palestinian childrenAccording to the video‚Äôs captions, the Israeli soldiers are supposed to protect the children from attacks by Israeli settlers in the area.But instead, as the video shows, the soldiers lob stones towards the children, including with a slingshot.The soldiers also failed to come to the designated point to meet the children, according to the video, and ‚Äúchecked one child‚Äôs bag and stopped another one without a clear reason.‚ÄùAl-Tuwani is a village in the South Hebron Hills area of the occupied West Bank, where thousands of Palestinians living in dozens of small communities are resisting expulsion or the loss of their land from encroaching Israeli settlements.Settlers from the nearby colony of Havat Maon habitually attack Palestinians.In one such incident last November, masked, rock-throwing Israelis injured a 6-year-old Palestinian girl in the head.The Israeli human rights group B‚ÄôTselem has regularly documented settler attacks, including a days-long rampage in Hebron a year ago while Israeli forces looked on and did nothing.Five Palestinian youths from the village of Hares are currently serving 15-year sentences imposed by Israeli military courts on accusations of stone-throwing that they deny.

3 | Sandy Arnold Carr | 2 | 10154970561018812_10154970665998812 | From Canexit ,,,,,,WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE LEARNED FROM READING WIKILEAKS So here's the REAL story. Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers.Copied and pasted...and pasted again and again and again until everyone reads this truth.... share

CLOSE CALL: Surveillance video captures a 3-year-old boy driving his toy car into oncoming traffic in China. Luckily, a police officer spotted the incident and rushed the child to safety. http://abcn.ws/2eAKiYe

1 | Annette M Bibb | 418 | 10154970488388812_10154970495273812 | I dont understand why the drivers of the cars didnt stop & get this baby out of harms way ....I Just Dont Get People anymore !
2 | Joseph Garcia | 117 | 10154970488388812_10154970517008812 | Drivers are like oh look a child in the middle of the street! Well better go around it. I've got things to do
3 | Russet Raw | 37 | 10154970488388812_10154970497083812 | America would charge the mom, have government officials called like DSS. Its strange that not one car stopped .. They just went around the child ... I guess that real freedom SMH
4 | Samantha Martin | 18 | 10154970488388812_10154970602443812 | This is scary! And the reason it's scary is because look how many adults drove past this kid even somebody on a bicycle just kept going like it was no big deal. Not to mention, where the hell is the kids parents at? What is going on with people in China
5 | La Malefica Hernandez-Gutierrez | 8 | 10154970488388812_10154970584838812 | And the million question...Where the hell are the parents??? Or the person who supposedly has to take of this little angel...and what's going on with ppl in china? It's not first "video" that i watch, of a kid in danger...
6 | Robert Bryant | 4 | 10154970488388812_10154970742793812 | Relax guys sheeez. If anyone's in danger, it was the motorists. China start their kids off in martial arts when the mother is in her 3rd trimester. A baby at this age is already a 7th degree black belt, and extremely dangerous. That's why they swerve and try to avoid instead of stopping to help. Hit or help this kid and receive toddler arm bars, and infant uppercuts until your unconscious. Ijs
7 | Christopher John | 3 | 10154970488388812_10154970706248812 | Yeah in America the most civilized country in the world....We would've stopped instead of just driving around. Obviously China is still 3rd world or if you want to be politically correct "Developing"
8 | Mary Miller Hill | 6 | 10154970488388812_10154970697463812 | At first I thought this was in the U.S.! Why does no one stop?! Oh, it's China. Nevermind.  I hope that our citizens are better human beings than to let a child be in danger. Though during this election cycle, I wonder.
9 | Ana Nunez | 12 | 10154970488388812_10154970530998812 | I don't get how nobody out of all them cars that drove past that kid didn't get out and grab him?!Wtf is wrong those people..don't like Chinese people they eat dogs, cats and let kids get hit by cars..smh.
10 | Loan Pham Lynch | 1 | 10154970488388812_10154971246603812 | It's China. Years ago, surveillance showed a toddler get run over by a trunk. Cars drive past and people walk past and no one help. An old lady finally did but it was too late.
11 | Ligia Man | 1 | 10154970488388812_10154970809213812 | And people don't stop.off course they don't. It's china.human life has no value.just Google the video of a small child in a factory being crushed by a vehicle and people drive by..by car,by bycicle, by foot..and Noone ever stoped.the baby was left there on the side like a rat on the side of the road.

13 | Cody Crawford | 2 | 10154970488388812_10154970647138812 | It's so disturbing that not one person stopped and got that child out of harms way! If you see a child in danger you do whatever you have to to protect them, even if that means laying your own life on the line. The sight of adults just driving around the child is a sign of our times and how this world has declined so much!

15 | Traci Ferguson Marks | 6 | 10154970488388812_10154970550478812 | Not only did no one in the cars stop to get him off the road but no one walking down the sidewalks rescued him either. Also the car that the policeman stopped in front of to get the boy didn't want to stop.
16 | Jason Carter | 20 | 10154970488388812_10154970493188812 | Jenny Kyle look how many people just passed that little kid instead of getting him off the road!!
17 | Nigel C. Weldon | 1 | 10154970488388812_10154970746248812 | I believe in China that if a driver hits a pedestrian they can only be cited if the person they hit survives - saw a case where this woman had backed over the person she had hit to make sure he was dead!
18 | Andrea Veihdeffer | 0 | 10154970488388812_10154971056463812 | People in china will literally sue you for trying to help, so that's why you see so many people not helping , they're afraid. Luckily that cop was there to save the day tho
19 | Susan Hicks Goodin | 0 | 10154970488388812_10154971423128812 | That's better than the one of the little toddler girl who was run over by a large truck...guy stopped....and continued over the second time...Everyone walking and driving by around her...one car actually ran over her feet driving around her....she was still alive....finally a old lady pulled the girl to the side of the road..........
20 | Ciara Duval | 0 | 10154970488388812_10154971162648812 | The fact that not one person stopped to get this baby to safety completely shocks me. In the video I seen this morning, the cop hands him back to, I guess, his mother and then she raises her hand as if to hit him... Just wow....

Pres. Barack Obama says U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Headquarters considering rerouting Dakota Access Pipeline, which is being built near the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation in North Dakota.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Tammy McGaa | 166 | 10154970440338812_10154970472163812 | Sure, move it...but moving it solves nothing. Make DAPL take accountability and be responsible. Until their pipeline has a safety lvl set to the highest standards, they should not be allowed to build it anywhere...or you just shift the problem from on place to the next. Their pipeline just spilled 55,000 gallons into an already endangered river....how many more river, how much more land...must be polluted with oil before this situation is fixed?
2 | John Stellmach | 73 | 10154970440338812_10154970494728812 | No it has to totally be stopped not rerouted. We will fight to the death for our rights. It's still 4000 feet from the faucet my grandson drinks from. It has to go period.
3 | Liberty Never Sleeps | 60 | 10154970440338812_10154970452863812 | The operative word is 'near', The pipeline does not cross any Native American claimed land. It's complete leftist nonsense they are protesting its construction.
4 | Sharon Hintz | 28 | 10154970440338812_10154970608073812 | We stole their land from them, invaded their territory and killed their people. We are the foreigners on this land every one of us that do not have native American blood, they never should have considered putting it through sacred ground in the first place then they would not have had to even consider rerouting it.
5 | Jennifer Hope | 15 | 10154970440338812_10154970655008812 | We need to cease our reliance on fossil fuels and switch to sustainable energy sources now! No more drilling for oil, anywhere! They'll trash/pollute our country and set back any advances we've made on climate change.

7 | Megan Marie Ortiz | 6 | 10154970440338812_10154970698193812 | This is bs. If you're actually paying attention to the pipeline updates you would know that it's less than a mile from the river right now. Exploring other options isn't an option. Especially not by taking a "few weeks". If he's not going to halt it and honor the treaty, it's a wrap.
8 | Carlos Gonzalez | 3 | 10154970440338812_10154970785063812 | I am opposed to it being built period. This isn't a solution. Pipelines break and pollute the Earth. I am glad sacred land isn't being destroyed and that the Native Americans are having the rights respected but what about other life that doesn't have a voice
9 | Debra Manteuffel | 5 | 10154970440338812_10154970672218812 | You know I used to think that the US Army Corps of engineers were the best of the best. But the last 10 or so years it seems like everything they touch turns to crap. From Katrina on down. Any reason why?
10 | Sarah Bremer | 3 | 10154970440338812_10154970986568812 | What good does that do? It still has to cross the same river to get to where they want it to! The sacred burial grounds is only a fragment of the problem! That river is clean drinking water for millions of people! Every single seam in that pipe is a leak hazard and WILL leak! Weather it's the day after its buried or 10 years or 100 years from now, it will leak! Why take the risk? We all know that in the next 10-20 years we will be using tons times more water, solar and wind power and won't need the damn oil anyway, then the pipes will sit there and co stanly leak into the river and ground spoiling everything it comes in contact with! Take your money and invest in the future! Invest in water,solar and wind energy!
11 | Billy Dunn | 16 | 10154970440338812_10154970454648812 | Shouldn't he be out playing golf or campaigning for the Clinton Crime Family instead of meddling in things he knows nothing about?
12 | Ashley Davis | 2 | 10154970440338812_10154971009838812 | Or we could fund places like Purdue University who are growing prairie grasses to create bio fuels which would help with pulling CO2 out of the air, but that doesn't make politicians money....
13 | Beverly Gay Burleson | 2 | 10154970440338812_10154970798178812 | This would never be done to any other type of cemetery so why are we desecrating Native American sacred land? It is wrong. There has to be another solution.

15 | Thomas Earnshaw | 0 | 10154970440338812_10154970797328812 | I think they just need to do away with it and do something else with their money ..Or maybe find a black neighborhood and run it through it.. Or even better a Muslim neighborhood .. Maybe they could get away with that..
16 | Keith Anderson | 0 | 10154970440338812_10154971444313812 | This is just one pipeline, there are many more in progress all over the nation. This one is getting so much attention because of it being on native land. The one in Florida, the Sabal Pipeline , Gov. Rick Scott is declaring eminent domain and seizing private citizens property down there.  In the constitution it clearly states eminent domain can only be implemented for "public use" and the Spectra Energy Co. will argue that this gas in this pipeline is going to be used by Floridians. Its not necessary, its just profitable. Eminent domain is a load of BS, and further more, Gov. Rick Scott owns stock in Spectra Energy Co. , how the hell is that not illegal as hell ? Obama and or Hillary may get this Dakota one rerouted , but there will be hundreds maybe thousands more in the future that will be constructed and thousands of private citizens will lose their property due to it. Our congress is pathetic and for sale to the highest bidder.
17 | Roxanne Francis | 0 | 10154970440338812_10154971085698812 | Crips! They need to just.........!

20 | Darryl Decker | 0 | 10154970440338812_10154971197918812 | its about time why did they think they could run a pipe line across indian land in the first place but those cops still need to answer for what they have been doing regardless
21 | Charlene Spurlock | 1 | 10154970440338812_10154971049198812 | When this leaks into the Missouri River, which is used to irrigate many crops, will anyone care then???  When you pollute all of the drinking water will you care???  This is Native American Land, always has been, until the government has screwed them once again.  They have already dug into sacred Indian Burial Grounds.  How would you like this to happen to Arlington Cemetary or where your family is laid to rest???  Wake up everyone.
22 | Neil Slocum | 0 | 10154970440338812_10154970793813812 | If they didn't want it then they shouldn't have sold their land. If they owned the land then they would be getting the money from the pipeline. Thus the pipe would be clear so they could see all the money they are making from it.
23 | Barb McLane Schutte | 2 | 10154970440338812_10154970680598812 | With all of the land available why could they not have located it somewhere that would do the least amount of damage?  How many times will buff countries government renege on agreements that have been made with Native American tribes?  This pipeline is going to be a source of bigger problems down the road.
24 | Tashi Delek | 3 | 10154970440338812_10154970463543812 | It will be interesting and maybe magical to route a pipeline to satisfy the liberals' request to not cross any river. Doesn't the Mississippi and the Colorado divide those states. Another trillion dollars spent and still crossing large body of water

It looks to me Michael shot that person 8 times in the back as he was running away from him!! He should not be allowed to be out on bond and he better be convicted life in prison without parole! I'm disgusted after watching the video on YouTube!
2 | Carolyn Baehr | 13 | 10154970235388812_10154970608123812 | ABC is such an instigator. Most of us working class Americans are NOT racist. I never notice what race I am working with or hanging with unless someone brings up the subject, which is almost never. I just pay attention to what's in their heart and their work ethics.

3 | JJ Janczak | 5 | 10154970235388812_10154970557653812 | ABC NEWS is Racebaiting and race hustling the news again. Maybe ABC wants another city such as Charlotte, Ferguson, Baltimore to go up in flames again.

2 | Michael Perry | 122 | 10154970080398812_10154970082753812 | Our survival is dependent on supporting Trump because:1. Trump did not force little girls to share their restrooms with adult males. 2. Trump did not increase our debt to $20 trillion.3. Trump did not ruin our credit.4. Trump did not double African-American unemployment.5. Trump did not send out healthcare costs skyrocketing (mine is now $660 a month. Compared to my $25 a month auto insurance from Insurance Panda, or my $10/month renters insurance from GEICO)5. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight solid years.6. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute and imprison Americans without due process. 7. Trump did not set free all the terrorists in Guantanamo Bay to return to the field of battle. 8. Trump did not constantly degrade civil rights, violate U.S. constitutional law, or commit treason.It is Barack Hussein Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the established grifters who accomplished the above. The Obama/Clinton cult have illegally occupied our government and swiped our future and that of our progeny.

4 | Vicky Flatte Mann | 62 | 10154970080398812_10154970141888812 | Using tax payers money to fly around the country and campaign for HRC should be illegal. Not every tax payer likes you or her or wants our tax dollars working to put her in office.
5 | John Krum | 41 | 10154970080398812_10154970142303812 | Oh, he's meddling alright. The whole democrat party has been meddling. Don't vote for LYING, corrupt career politicians this election. Its time to clean house!
6 | Ashley Frazier-Smith | 33 | 10154970080398812_10154970199528812 | I feel like when someone comes out and says they are not involved and are not meddling then they are actually doing what they say they are not doing. The fact that people trust people who lie their way into office is sad.
7 | Christa Leni Cutler | 39 | 10154970080398812_10154970085378812 | Do you remember when Hillary was disbarred and fired from the Watergate investigation for unethical behavior and lying?Do you remember when Hillary took campaign donations and endorsements for the KKK?Do you remember when Hillary kissed Robert Byrd's cheek when the ex-KKK leader retired from congress?Do you remember when Hillary too campaign donations and endorsements from Planned Parent hood?Do you remember when Hillary allowed 4 Americans in Benghazi to be brutally tortured and murdered?Do you remember Hillary lying about it, then lying some more and then accusing their parents of lying?Do you remember when Hillary asked, "What difference does it make"?Do you remember when Hillary called millions of Americans, "deplorable and irredeemable"?Do you remember when Hillary "lost" 6 BILLION dollars of OUR money?Do you remember when Hillary did NOT go to Louisiana during the massive flooding there?Do you remember when Hillary covered up and then attacked the women that "Slick Willie" raped and molested?Do you remember Hillary say, " We are going to raise the taxes on the middle class"?Do you remember when Hillary said, "We are going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business"?Do you remember when Hillary said that she would take away our guns?Do you remember when Hillary deleted then "bleached" over 33,000 emails?Do you remember when Hillary lied and perjured herself for 11 hours during the investigation into those emails?Do you remember when Hillary had to return $200,000 worth of items she stole from the White House?Do you remember when Hillary said she had to "duck sniper fire" when she landed in Bosnia?Do you remember when Hillary said she wanted to increase muslims in America by 550%?I certainly do...We simply MUST elect Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence on November 8th!!!!!!!
8 | Chris L. Christensen | 17 | 10154970080398812_10154970281853812 | Are you kidding?! Barack is lying straight to the American people's face!! He is fighting the investigation tooth and nail because full disclosure will obviously reveal his own deep involvement! Why a stinking hypocrite!
9 | Jerry Allsman | 33 | 10154970080398812_10154970091238812 | Does anyone know if Hillary is holding a rally around St. Louis anytime soon??I was wanting to put on a black jacket with BIG BRIGHT YELLOW letters F-B-I printed across the back and try to push my way as close to the front as possible!!
10 | Pamelia Sullins | 6 | 10154970080398812_10154970239588812 | I'm sure you've made a deliberate effort to "LOOK LIKE" you aren't meddling but what are you really doing? We all know you are guilty of many things and one thing for sure...you are guilty of acting clueless about Hillary's emails, which we all know you knew about! Treason is an offense that our corrupt government wants to ignore. We need to Clean the Swamp! Trump2016
11 | Karen Drennen | 3 | 10154970080398812_10154970266388812 | I am hoping that if Trump should win, the news that is reported from your network should not insinuate a hatred for the Trump supporters that is presently viewed in your broadcasts. As you know, the DNC has been the source of violence incited at Trump rallies. Please do not follow suit.
12 | Cassie Hanson | 6 | 10154970080398812_10154970222428812 | Thank you President Barack Obama for all you have done for this country. For picking it up after Bush pretty much destroyed it. I guess people won't ever remember how America was looking after Bush.
13 | Sandi Massey Guillemette | 5 | 10154970080398812_10154970333643812 | You would most certainly be supporting her... you are supporting her and she is under criminal investigation... she is a liar and cheater and you know this and still you support her
14 | Tashi Delek | 6 | 10154970080398812_10154970191888812 | Another FBI mole shows up in Wikileak's email dump conspiring in a Clinton criminal investigation. Is our highly moral democratic leader Obama truthful in telling us that Democrats do not operate under leaks and innuendo? Judge for yourself and read Wikileak on assistant DOJ attorney. Justice is blind but not stupid
15 | Cassie Hanson | 0 | 10154970080398812_10154970604113812 | it's funny how a lot of people have the nerve to insult President Obama just because Trump is doing it. This is still our current president, have some respect.
16 | Bob Derrick | 1 | 10154970080398812_10154970144983812 | How much pollution are these two candidates generating crossing back and fourth across our country? How much money is being spent on all this madness for only a four year job? With all the poverty, unemployment, hunger in our country, we sit back and think this is acceptable. Trump says things that are over the top. Hillary says she's never heard men say dirty things about women. Both these candidates are bull****ing Americans. We need to stand-up for America.
17 | Angela Bender Shear | 0 | 10154970080398812_10154970558633812 | This could have been a very different race, I think the media is to blame for that if they had given just as much coverage on the Libertarian party as they did for the Democrat or Republican Party ... but the media picks and chooses who they're going to put their focus on it's not an unbiased news reporting anymore !!!!  There is room for more than just two parties
18 | Mike Hofer | 0 | 10154970080398812_10154971426663812 | It's more like that you have done nothing in the capacity of president for the last year.And you are worried about saying something about Hillarys emails, but you and your wife have been campaigning for her for the last 6 months on the taxpayers dime.I think your actions speak pretty loudly about how you want to influence the election
19 | Donald Oula | 0 | 10154970080398812_10154971378473812 | American leadership doesn't need angel..it needs a devil because the foundation of her economy is based on ungodly behaviour overseas, and that must be one of the charactistics of superpower. So the only person who can retain these values is Clinton..she can make USA to be more powerful than ever..unless you want to hand over leadership to Russia and China. ..so vote trump and sink your economy because it relies on foreign policy....
20 | David Hughes | 0 | 10154970080398812_10154970542138812 | Hillary Clinton right hand huma abedin went to Saudi arabia for 16 years of training and school. after she returned she go to Clinton as intern. now Saudi sends millions to Clintons and the foundation. Saudi own Clinton...you really voting for king saud to be president with Hillary as stand in...get real , read up on things
21 | Brian Eubanks | 4 | 10154970080398812_10154970127403812 | All of the insults between Americans over this election.We are ready to fight each other over political propaganda. We are falling for the divide and conquer scheme hook, line and sinker. There is no more We the People. and it is sad. Such division. Such animosity and even hate. Repeat after me- if you still remember the words "I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
22 | David Hughes | 0 | 10154970080398812_10154970528508812 | FBI said they prosecuter would prosecute, FBI prosecutes is DOJ. so lynch refused to put Hillary in jail, by order of Obama...Obama wants separation from this for denial of corruption
23 | Robert Mayes | 0 | 10154970080398812_10154970550193812 | A deliberate effort not to LOOK like he's meddling. Like CNN and ABC trying to LOOK like they're not in Hillary's pocket.   We know you are, you're just trying to keep it out of the public eye.
24 | Roger RC Cozine II | 1 | 10154970080398812_10154970422488812 | Time to raise the bulls**t flag. ABC is the absolute worst news media ever. The bias and irresponsible journalism is unprecedented
25 | Tina Ritchings-Wrinkle | 3 | 10154970080398812_10154970144643812 | Knowing that there are people out there that will vote for whomever he recommends he also should not be meddling in the election. And the tax payers should not be funding his campaign efforts.
