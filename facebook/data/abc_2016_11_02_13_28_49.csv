Pres. Barack Obama on FBI probe of Hillary Clinton's emails: “I’ve made a very deliberate effort to make sure that I don’t look like I’m meddling in what are supposed to be independent processes for making these assessments."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jackie Jeffries | 81 | 10154970080398812_10154970083458812 | Then why is the DOJ blocking investigations into the Clinton foundation?
2 | Michael Perry | 78 | 10154970080398812_10154970082753812 | Our survival is dependent on supporting Trump because:1. Trump did not force little girls to share their restrooms with adult males. 2. Trump did not increase our debt to $20 trillion.3. Trump did not ruin our credit.4. Trump did not double African-American unemployment.5. Trump did not send out healthcare costs skyrocketing (mine is now $660 a month. Compared to my $25 a month auto insurance from Insurance Panda, or my $10/month renters insurance from GEICO)5. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight solid years.6. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute and imprison Americans without due process. 7. Trump did not set free all the terrorists in Guantanamo Bay to return to the field of battle. 8. Trump did not constantly degrade civil rights, violate U.S. constitutional law, or commit treason.It is Barack Hussein Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the established grifters who accomplished the above. The Obama/Clinton cult have illegally occupied our government and swiped our future and that of our progeny.
3 | Gerald Vaughan | 28 | 10154970080398812_10154970132553812 | Like Obama didn't meddle in Libya, Syria and Yemen! I call bullsh!t! Stop flying around on my dime campaigning for Hillary if you're not meddling!
4 | Vicky Flatte Mann | 25 | 10154970080398812_10154970141888812 | Using tax payers money to fly around the country and campaign for HRC should be illegal. Not every tax payer likes you or her or wants our tax dollars working to put her in office.
5 | Jerry Allsman | 26 | 10154970080398812_10154970091238812 | Does anyone know if Hillary is holding a rally around St. Louis anytime soon??I was wanting to put on a black jacket with BIG BRIGHT YELLOW letters F-B-I printed across the back and try to push my way as close to the front as possible!!
6 | John Krum | 16 | 10154970080398812_10154970142303812 | Oh, he's meddling alright. The whole democrat party has been meddling. Don't vote for LYING, corrupt career politicians this election. Its time to clean house!
7 | Ashley Frazier-Smith | 10 | 10154970080398812_10154970199528812 | I feel like when someone comes out and says they are not involved and are not meddling then they are actually doing what they say they are not doing. The fact that people trust people who lie their way into office is sad.
8 | Christa Leni Cutler | 26 | 10154970080398812_10154970085378812 | Do you remember when Hillary was disbarred and fired from the Watergate investigation for unethical behavior and lying?Do you remember when Hillary took campaign donations and endorsements for the KKK?Do you remember when Hillary kissed Robert Byrd's cheek when the ex-KKK leader retired from congress?Do you remember when Hillary too campaign donations and endorsements from Planned Parent hood?Do you remember when Hillary allowed 4 Americans in Benghazi to be brutally tortured and murdered?Do you remember Hillary lying about it, then lying some more and then accusing their parents of lying?Do you remember when Hillary asked, "What difference does it make"?Do you remember when Hillary called millions of Americans, "deplorable and irredeemable"?Do you remember when Hillary "lost" 6 BILLION dollars of OUR money?Do you remember when Hillary did NOT go to Louisiana during the massive flooding there?Do you remember when Hillary covered up and then attacked the women that "Slick Willie" raped and molested?Do you remember Hillary say, " We are going to raise the taxes on the middle class"?Do you remember when Hillary said, "We are going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business"?Do you remember when Hillary said that she would take away our guns?Do you remember when Hillary deleted then "bleached" over 33,000 emails?Do you remember when Hillary lied and perjured herself for 11 hours during the investigation into those emails?Do you remember when Hillary had to return $200,000 worth of items she stole from the White House?Do you remember when Hillary said she had to "duck sniper fire" when she landed in Bosnia?Do you remember when Hillary said she wanted to increase muslims in America by 550%?I certainly do...We simply MUST elect Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence on November 8th!!!!!!!
9 | Chris L. Christensen | 2 | 10154970080398812_10154970281853812 | Are you kidding?! Barack is lying straight to the American people's face!! He is fighting the investigation tooth and nail because full disclosure will obviously reveal his own deep involvement! Why a stinking hypocrite!
10 | Cassie Hanson | 3 | 10154970080398812_10154970222428812 | Thank you President Barack Obama for all you have done for this country. For picking it up after Bush pretty much destroyed it. I guess people won't ever remember how America was looking after Bush.
11 | Tashi Delek | 2 | 10154970080398812_10154970191888812 | Another FBI mole shows up in Wikileak's email dump conspiring in a Clinton criminal investigation. Is our highly moral democratic leader Obama truthful in telling us that Democrats do not operate under leaks and innuendo? Judge for yourself and read Wikileak on assistant DOJ attorney. Justice is blind but not stupid
12 | Bob Derrick | 0 | 10154970080398812_10154970144983812 | How much pollution are these two candidates generating crossing back and fourth across our country? How much money is being spent on all this madness for only a four year job? With all the poverty, unemployment, hunger in our country, we sit back and think this is acceptable. Trump says things that are over the top. Hillary says she's never heard men say dirty things about women. Both these candidates are bull****ing Americans. We need to stand-up for America.
13 | Pamelia Sullins | 0 | 10154970080398812_10154970239588812 | I'm sure you've made a deliberate effort to "LOOK LIKE" you aren't meddling but what are you really doing? We all know you are guilty of many things and one thing for sure...you are guilty of acting clueless about Hillary's emails, which we all know you knew about! Treason is an offense that our corrupt government wants to ignore. We need to Clean the Swamp! Trump2016
14 | Karen Drennen | 1 | 10154970080398812_10154970266388812 | I am hoping that if Trump should win, the news that is reported from your network should not insinuate a hatred for the Trump supporters that is presently viewed in your broadcasts. As you know, the DNC has been the source of violence incited at Trump rallies. Please do not follow suit.
15 | Brian Eubanks | 3 | 10154970080398812_10154970127403812 | All of the insults between Americans over this election.We are ready to fight each other over political propaganda. We are falling for the divide and conquer scheme hook, line and sinker. There is no more We the People. and it is sad. Such division. Such animosity and even hate. Repeat after me- if you still remember the words "I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
16 | Sandi Massey Guillemette | 1 | 10154970080398812_10154970333643812 | You would most certainly be supporting her... you are supporting her and she is under criminal investigation... she is a liar and cheater and you know this and still you support her
17 | Tina Ritchings-Wrinkle | 2 | 10154970080398812_10154970144643812 | Knowing that there are people out there that will vote for whomever he recommends he also should not be meddling in the election. And the tax payers should not be funding his campaign efforts.
18 | Tom Langston | 3 | 10154970080398812_10154970296373812 | Comey must have agreed not to drag #BarackObama's electronic devices into the investigation.#BarackObama is a sociopathic liar, a national disgrace, aids illegals in avoiding deportation, an enemy of the Constitution, is decimating our military, politicizes death to meet his gun control agenda, racially divisive, a promoter of black genocide by abortion, has engineered the weakest economic recovery in the post-war era, denies the threat of radical Islam and then supports that threat, a communist sympathizer and a traitor to civilization. That is his legacy.
19 | Joel Green | 0 | 10154970080398812_10154970168143812 | Mmhh! "What are suppossed to be independent processes for making these assessment". Apparently it seems they are not independent anymore,is that the case? To me the POTUS statement is a loaded one, not saying much but full of meaning!

22 | Bill Witwer | 1 | 10154970080398812_10154970256573812 | Well you haven't done a good job at not meddling either. Quit spending tax dollars on campaigning. Get out now !  DRAIN THE SWAMP!  Good riddance.
23 | Todd Sanders | 1 | 10154970080398812_10154970238958812 | Yea ok... And Hillary Clinton didn't break any laws either I guess. It's comical now to watch Obama and Hillary lie. I think they may actually believe that we're buying this bull 💩
24 | Marsha Brown Van Doren | 0 | 10154970080398812_10154970178113812 | She lies for no reason, why does anyone think as President they will know what's going on? Most corrupt person I've ever witnessed!

2 | Barbara Donastorg | 22 | 10154969968958812_10154969989348812 | Such a shame that children are being taught by their parents (and yes they are) to behave in this manner instead of being taught that you can disagree with a person's choice without being disrespectful and disruptive.
3 | David Allen | 2 | 10154969968958812_10154970089103812 | So essentially the school 🏫/teacher simply said "when something gets to hard to deal with just ignore it and it will go away. ". I thought schools were teaching kids about critical thinking not how to not deal with issues that might be difficult
4 | Deana Jewel Hulett | 23 | 10154969968958812_10154969973768812 | In other words, the kids called Clinton a liar and the school didn't like it!

And it states that Hillary was a huge fan of Sal Alinsky.  And so far Obama has put several of the Sal-socialist ideas into play.  Either way we as Americans look foolish because our final two Candidates have rubbish under their noses.

9 | Rebecca Flora | 0 | 10154969968958812_10154970157703812 | When reading some of the comments and replies of this post pretty much sums up why the school canceled the mock vote. These are 10-11-12 yr olds who's political views are based on what they hear parents and other adults say unguarded. They hear adults call Clinton "Killary" and a "socialist liar" and Trump an "an orange cheeto" and "a misogynistic grouper". It's fantastic to have your children become involved in the political process of this country. But teach your children to have an unbiased point of view, review all the facts, and to be generally more informed on their opinions. We surround ourselves with polarizing and bias news sources, so that we hear what we want to hear. Stop reading "news" from occupy democrats or the comical conservative. The children are looking to us to model behavior. In a society where we are teaching children not to bully others, we are demonstrating that this only applies to when they're in school because it's ok when you're an adult to bully others when it comes to election season.

Demagogues have usually advocated immediate, violent action to address a national crisis while accusing moderate and thoughtful opponents of weakness. Demagogues violate established rules of political conduct; most who were elected to high office changed their democracy into some form of dictatorship.Demagogues appealed directly to the emotions of the poor and uninformed, pursuing power, telling lies to stir up hysteria, exploiting crises to intensify popular support for their calls to action. Demagogues do these things relentlessly and without self-restraint.

Florida college student accused of killing a couple and chewing on the dead man's face told deputies, "Help me, I ate something bad" and then admitted it was "humans" as he spit out a piece of flesh.

1 | Mariah Monet | 371 | 10154969868693812_10154969870538812 | Florida College student? Or Psychopathic murderer. Just like it was Brock Turner "The Stanford  swimmer" ..... Not Brock Turner the rapist . I hate the media.
2 | Wendely Wright | 148 | 10154969868693812_10154969989373812 | .....and yet the cops didn't fear for their lives, he wasn't shot and killed on the spot. He was tasered, that didn't work, so the cops waited around for a police dog to bite him in order to "subdue" him.....how many victims did he kill and injure?.....double standard.
3 | Matthew Wynn | 100 | 10154969868693812_10154969873473812 | Ok this happened 2-3 months ago, where are the toxicology results?

5 | Roger RC Cozine II | 20 | 10154969868693812_10154969973098812 | 😂 The crazy part of this story isn't that this kid ate someones face. It's the fact that he said he "ate something bad." Everyone knows that humans taste like chicken! Chickens are f**king delicious! This chicken disrespecting a$$#ole needs to get the death penalty! 😂
6 | Lori Brown | 17 | 10154969868693812_10154969989023812 | If what his mother said was true (claiming to have super powers, having been sent to help people), then he is delusional & psychotic. I believe her. No one in their right mind would attack & eat another person. Those poor people just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
7 | Randy Rawlins | 31 | 10154969868693812_10154969998543812 | They showed great restraint not shooting a man EATING SOMEONE'S FACE, but you can be shot with your hands up. Got it.
8 | Althea Sutherland Mcfarlane | 2 | 10154969868693812_10154970105283812 | Gracious! He took chemicals from the garage but was already suspected of taking synthetic drugs before he got to the couple's home. Close down those gas stations and corner stores that keep selling bath salts and other so  dangerous things to our citizens. This isn't a death penalty or an incarnation case. This is a banana case. Everyone goes just a wee little bananas sometimes but this is really off the charts. Protect your children from the streets and those corner stories with strange owners and names. Some of them not all sell children anything and send the money abroad. Government needs to monitor those stores and gas stations more closely. Parents needs to do the same. They'll  continue to  introduce kids to dangerous substances that seem innocent. This child needs to be put away in an institution for life and be admonished to help other parents and teen stay safe by telling his story. He needs to be taken to every elementary, high and upper education campus to warn kids under 21 about the dangers of consuming things they don't know about for the purpose of getting high. That's what I'd do. Turn the case over all those on fb who are brilliant minds. Lol!

20 | David Eickman | 9 | 10154969822618812_10154969918793812 | Busted:  -If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.
21 | Will McGinnis | 0 | 10154969822618812_10154970213088812 | All you folks who are bashing Clinton... need to honestly look at Trump as well... neither candidate is what we might call 'morally superior'... Trump is a mess as well.. that said... it comes down to policy... Frankly, Clinton has policies that will do more for the middle class than any other candidate... so if you can put aside all the business of sending one or the other to hell... take an honest look at their policies & vote your conscience

24 | John Hourihan | 2 | 10154969822618812_10154969854693812 | In 1964 I graduated from high school. I was awake, informed and tuned in to the country around me. I saw the vicious truth of what we are on the verge of ushering back into our country. No matter which candidate you support, please listen to what I saw back then. I had seen the courage of Rosa Parks and of the Freedom Riders. I watched churches burned with people, some of them children, inside. I watched boys killed for “looking at” a white woman. I watched the helpless president try his best to stop the murders across the southern part of our country. Police cruisers pulling over cars and then killing the occupants if they were black. Arrests were made, they weren’t charged with murder. They were charged with withholding the civil rights of the people they killed. The charges didn’t matter. All-white juries found the police officers innocent. In 1963 I saw the KKK torch a church and burn to death four little girls because of the color of their skin. State legislators stood up against the federal government in an effort to continue the policies of segregation. These officials were active members of these hate groups. Now these groups, KKK, white supremacists, anti-semite, the entire alt. right hate groups are en masse supporting one candidate, Donald Trump, because as the leader of the KKK says, “His policies are our policies.” When you look at that ballot in front of you in the next few days please ask yourself if you are ready to vote for a return to those days and the days decades earlier when the violence was even worse. This is what Donald Trump, a proven racist, means by “Make America Great Again.” Please don’t bring these people back to power. Please vote for Clinton.

Despite growing protests from Native American groups and environmental activists, construction of the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline is likely past the point of no return, some experts say, while others noted that to find a solution to the tense standoff, both sides may need to compromise a little.

1 | Kristy Jones Woods | 275 | 10154969606928812_10154969620298812 | How do you ask Native Americans to compromise?! I think they've BEEN compromising for quite a while now. Maybe someone else should finally start "compromising". 😡 #NoDAPL #WaterIsLife
2 | Brian Parsons | 137 | 10154969606928812_10154969616568812 | What I don't get is why the concerns of Bismarck were heard and it was rerouted but the concerns of the natives (which are very similar) fall on deaf ears and it's not being rerouted for them.
3 | Roger RC Cozine II | 50 | 10154969606928812_10154969632633812 | The only major hurdle preventing the pipeline from being rerouted is the government selling out to these crooked corporations. Land, roads, water and people can be moved at any time. Because these are Native American's, the government feels as if their voice shouldn't matter. It's just sad.
4 | Janelle Marie | 24 | 10154969606928812_10154969788303812 | The Native Americans should NOT have to compromise! The US Government wrote the treaty (after they murdered and slaughtered thousands of Native Americans and stole millions of acres of land) and stated it was their land, so legally, the oil company cannot build on their land, period!!
5 | Dana Donald | 30 | 10154969606928812_10154969634923812 | #cantdrinkoil #governmentlies #waterislife we should ALL be protesting !!! New ways of energy need to be in place NOW ... Out with oil !! It's sooo destructive to our earth & us!! #istandwithstandingrock
6 | Zachary Goates | 12 | 10154969606928812_10154969697793812 | Notice the difference! The Bundy protest they used their 2nd amendment rights. Maybe if they showed force the cops would back up. That's why that amendment was created.!.!.! The Constitution says "we the people of the United States" not " we the federal government of the United States" people we are the government! And when we stop handing our lives to people born with silver and gold spoons in their mouths. It will stop until then. We are going to always loose.!.!.!.!
7 | Laura Gilbert | 2 | 10154969606928812_10154969731848812 | Exactly, Donald! In the planning phase, no one showed up with concerns. This is all for dramatic effect!!! Not sure what their angle is, but the time to protest is over!!!
8 | Jennifer McArthur Carroll | 10 | 10154969606928812_10154969701148812 | I no longer recognize this country. The US is sitting idly by while Native American land is violated AGAIN and a demagogue with ties to Russia and more than a striking resemblance to Hitler is on the ballot. Is this the Twilight Zone or just the Bizarro United States?!?!
9 | Kyle Caudill | 6 | 10154969606928812_10154969712448812 | No compromise! Keep it going! We made this treaty with our Native American people and we're just going to let big money oil companies violate it?! Screw them! #NoDAPL
10 | Sylvia Heston | 3 | 10154969606928812_10154969682968812 | Can someone explain to me how the pipeline was "approved" in the first place? I'm afraid that while the "news" was fixated on other things, they failed to look in to this awful situation.
11 | Ann Margaret Venne MacKenzie | 2 | 10154969606928812_10154969649743812 | IDIOTS! Why don't they see the obvious signals to stop - like the obvious threat to the local watershed of the local First Nations people (on land that was given in perpetuity through a U.S. treaty to them), the herd of bison appearing and eagles flying over? How incredibly dull, stupid and greedy are the people that run this project?
12 | Robert Vandergrift | 0 | 10154969606928812_10154969936533812 | I think our government needs to be held accountable for allowing this pipeline being built. I think putting hefty fines on Obama Biden Kerry and every politician in DC would get the point across. I mena hefty fines, I mean huge amount that would leave them homeless.
13 | Dustin Wayne Jarvis | 0 | 10154969606928812_10154970228783812 | The pipeline doesn't even cross the reservation lines and the line is well below the water table. All these tools should do research and quit bitching and crying. If people didn't want this to happen then maybe you should walk to work and not use any fuel. Dumbasses
14 | Bryan McClellan | 4 | 10154969606928812_10154969703013812 | No compromise. The pipe line is poison. So when in leaks what do these people do. Last the point of no return. Maybe they should have thought more of the people not their pocket books. So they should eat the loss not the people. They knew people wouldn't be happy. They did it anyway.
15 | Lavon Kittick | 0 | 10154969606928812_10154970237883812 | World 🌍 Peace Love And Happiness Tanyan yahi ~ Bizaani iwe ~ Kia Ora Wowahwala un wahi ~ Philamayaye Knowledge Is The Path To #WorldPeace There are thousands of miles of pipeline in the U.S. and they leak every single day. The protests surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) are not without good cause. The following are just a few of the major leaks that mainstream media has refused to tell you about.Are you still wondering why So many people support the #NoDAPL protectors? This spill is part of the reason. Imagine, if you will, tens of thousands of gallons of oil pouring into the river that provides the drinking water for over 10 million people. Would you want to drink it? or swim in it? or eat anything from it?185,000 Miles of U.S. Oil Pipelines Leak EVERY SINGLE DAY.A North Dakota oil well owned by Oasis Petroleum Inc blew out over the weekend and has yet to be capped, leaking more than 67,000 gallons of crude so far and endangering a tributary of the Missouri River, according to Ernest Scheyder of Reuters. The cause of the blowout remains unknown, though state officials surmise it may have been caused by hydraulic fracturing of a nearby well in a situation referred to in the industry as “communication” between wells.Thick gray smoke rose from the Helling Trust 11-15H well site on Monday afternoon as dozens of tractor-trailers hauled in vacuum trucks and other cleanup equipment. Oasis is trying to cap the well by pumping in a thick mixture of mud and clay, state officials said.The blowout happened at 11 p.m. local time on Saturday. The company worked all weekend to regain control of the well, including flying in staff from its Houston headquarters, but so far efforts have been unsuccessful, according to state and local officials.The well is about 15 miles south of White Earth, North Dakota, in Mountrail County.Scheyder says, “Unlike most blowouts, this one did not produce a geyser of crude but a smaller burst roughly 5 feet (1.52 m) in height that sprayed oil onto the well pad. Some of the oil pooled onto the pad and some was carried by a light wind to the White Earth River, a tributary of the Missouri River, roughly 850 feet (260 m) down a nearby cliff.”“This is not your typical blowout,” said Bill Suess of the state’s Department of Health.A light sheen of oil was on the nearby river, and a Reuters reporter counted at least 16 absorbent booms that had been installed in an attempt to keep the oil from moving downstream.State officials reported approximately 84,000 gallons of saltwater also leaked from the well. Crude oil extracted from the state’s Bakken shale formation typically contains high concentrations of brine (salt water) that must be separated.Oasis said it was working “to ensure that safe and thorough remediation efforts are completed in a timely fashion.”The company has hired a Superior Energy Services to assist in capping the well.When you are deciding whether or not you should support the #NoDAPL protectors or corporate profits, take this oil spill into consideration. Make the wise choice for the future of America, the future of your children.In January of 2015 alone we saw two major pipeline leaks in North Dakota, the same state where the fight against DAPL is focused.The spills there saw more than 6 million gallons of oil products leaking into the environmentThe most recent of such leaks occurred on September 9, 2016.Approximately 252,000 gallons as well as 336,000 of gas leaked when a Colonial Pipeline exploded in Alabama.Alabama and Georgia quickly declared a state of emergency but the public knew nothing about the pipeline explosion because the mainstream media was helping the oil corporations keep the environmental terrorism quiet.There is a long and sordid history of pipeline leaks all across the United States that most of the public are completely unaware of.Amanda Starbuck from the Center For Effective Government recalls that “on June 14, a natural gas pipeline ruptured and burst into flames near Cuero, Texas, releasing an estimated 165,000 pounds of toxic volatile organic compounds into the air. Nearby residents evacuated their homes, but no one was injured. Still, the accident serves as another reminder of the dangers of transporting natural gas and other hazardous materials.”Starbuck adds that “nearly half of America’s crude oil pipelines are more than 50 years old, increasing the chance of corrosion and failure. Human error and failure of operators to act on potential vulnerabilities in their pipelines also contribute to accidents. So do natural phenomena like lightning and earthquakes.”Moreover, she explains that “only 139 federal pipeline inspectors are responsible for examining over 2.6 million miles of pipelines. That’s nearly 18,000 miles of pipeline per inspector – clearly not enough to ensure the integrity of our nation’s aging pipeline infrastructure.”Additional funding for inspections is an important step. But to completely avoid these accidents, we need to shift to renewable energy sources.Are you living near a pipeline? Visit the interactive map from the National Pipeline Mapping System to see what pipelines cross your state.The total amount of money spent on lobbying from Big Oil is almost $61,000,000 a year. We don’t need another oil pipeline. If you agree, STAND WITH STANDING ROCK and help SPREAD THE WORD!Pipelines are NOT safe. #NoDAPL #WaterIsLife #KeepItInTheGround #WorldNews #IStandWithStandingRock

18 | Marybeth Buse | 1 | 10154969606928812_10154969739438812 | It needs to be rerouted, it is junk oil (tar sands)  a danger to Native Lands and their water. The president said last nite he has asked the Corps of Engineers to look at rerouting.
19 | Roger Ramirez | 0 | 10154969606928812_10154970120158812 | So sad...there are already so many cases of people dying because of polluted water and other so many other case of sicknesses. When will it end. People already are dying. Is oil more precise than a human life?
20 | Angel Godinez | 6 | 10154969606928812_10154969690578812 | It's time to flood Dakota with protesters. Lets see them remove hundreds of thousands of individuals. They can handle relatively small numbers. But they will be locked down with huge numbers.
21 | Brian Eubanks | 1 | 10154969606928812_10154969860788812 | You do not have to be a Native American (although I am partially) nor an environmental activist to want this project stopped. You just have to care about traditions of heritage and the land.
22 | Jacqueline Molina | 3 | 10154969606928812_10154969645803812 | Leave them alone! The love for the Native Community grows from ppl who love amd support them in this fight to keep THEIR LAND!!! Pipefitters need to turnaroud and go back where they came from!!!

24 | Christine Patterson | 1 | 10154969606928812_10154969876588812 | Nope. No compromise get your damn oil pipeline & move it somewhere else. Standing Rock Sioux Nation should not & will not compromise on a blatantly obvious illegal trespass by the Energy Transfer Partners oil company. If the pipeline was to dangerous for the white people of Bismarck, then it sure the hell still dangerous to the Native Americans' Tribal Lands. Move it some where else Black Oil Snake lovers.
25 | Robert Harris | 3 | 10154969606928812_10154969702188812 | Environmentalists and liberals don't understand how compromise works. So any give always has to come from the right, the pipeline will go through, with or without the Indians approval.

4 | Tony Gaytan | 55 | 10154969436663812_10154969450463812 | And you wonder why some cops shoot first ask questions later.I seriously doubt that the dumb f**ks that protest are gonna denounce these two murders.
5 | Dan Judd | 28 | 10154969436663812_10154969517158812 | Is anybody still mad at Colin Kaepernick for his horrible, insulting (that's sarcasm, folks - he was NOT stomping on the flag or Vets) protest of sitting during the National Anthem?  How about those Native Americans in the Dakotas blocking traffic stopping (NOT shooting to defend their anncestors' graves) a--holes from violating treaties and trespassing on THEIR land without even asking them first?  Can anyone think of all the other instances where people have tried NOT killing someone to get attention?
6 | Jessica Biggs | 13 | 10154969436663812_10154969968543812 | A white THUG kills cops....yet most of the commenters are focused on BLM or Obama. Neither of which had anything to do with this crime, especially since according to his FB page, the killer hated blacks just as much as he did cops. Guess Blue lives don't matter as much when it's a white person killing them. Sad!
7 | Harold Weber | 14 | 10154969436663812_10154969496513812 | I know BLM will be celebrating this. Hilliary and Barack will be silent. Trump will continue to state the need for law and order.

12 | Mort Davis | 2 | 10154969436663812_10154969626693812 | Someone needs to educate your "Chief Justice Corespondent", Piers Anthony. No one has ever been killed by a gun.  Guns are inanimate objects. They are incapable of acting on their own. I realize ABC "News" has a far left leaning bias, which includes a hatred of guns, gun owners, the NRA. Over 100 mil;lion Americans legally own over 300 million guns. If We were the problem, there'd be a lot more dead people. The people who do violence WITH guns overwhelmingly are people who cannot legally own, nor carry, guns.

6 | Michael Braxton | 50 | 10154969324168812_10154969360108812 | The Clintons gave millions of American jobs away with the North American trade agreement January 1, 1994. Resulting to The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) dates the beginning of the recession as December 2007. According to the Department of Labor, roughly 8.7 million jobs were shed from February 2008 to February 2010, and GDP contracted by 5.1%, making the Great Recession the worst since the Great Depression.Now Clinton makes it sound like she can get the jobs back in this country as if it was somebody else's fault.Bill gets blowjobs in the White House from a 22-year-old intern while he's 49 years old. He has  women who say he has raped them but Hillary still covers up for him. Threatens people to keep it from coming public, how can she still talk about Donald Trump.Cheated in the debate Wikileaks emails have revealed that Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the DNC, provided Hillary Clinton with debate details that would give her an edge over Bernie Sanders.Lied about murdering the people in Benghazi.How quickly we forget!  If you’re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane—you won’t believe what you have forgotten.  If you’re under 35, read on—I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn’t a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make.

8 | Bruce Moon | 51 | 10154969324168812_10154969338568812 | Did Bill promise AG Lynch on their illegal meeting in her plane on the tarmac that if she helped obstruct the FBI and Congressional investigations of the email crimes and the Clinton Foundation crimes, that she could continue as AG and keep he cool private plane?

10 | Angela Wright | 28 | 10154969324168812_10154969391838812 | Whatever, here is what it will look like:Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.

3 | Aida Torres | 265 | 10154969243428812_10154969259258812 | No one wants to think about what that uneducated fool will do to the white house most likely turn it into a crack bin with prostitutes all around. No one cares cause he won't be in office. Trump isn't for America he proves that everyday he doesn't care for an American just selling us out to the highest bidder. He won't get close to the white house 😘
4 | Will McGinnis | 149 | 10154969243428812_10154969272218812 | All you folks who are bashing Clinton... need to honestly look at Trump as well... neither candidate is what we might call 'morally superior'... Trump is a mess as well.. that said... it comes down to policy... Frankly, Clinton has policies that will do more for the middle class than any other candidate... so if you can put aside all the business of sending one or the other to hell... take an honest look at their policies & vote your conscience

8 | Mike Caswell | 62 | 10154969243428812_10154969258253812 | I will be voting for Donald Trump. I know he can act like a bully from time to time, and doesn't say things in a political ways many times, but who does? He says the things some people are afraid to admit. Republicans used to pay a lot of things for us with pride, but anymore because too many people take this country for granted, abusing the privileges of this country. That doesn't mean they want to be richer and the poor to be poorer. They actually want everyone to work hard for a living. Donald Trump is trying to convey that message to many people, but many are too stubborn to listen. Trump is definitely not a conformist, that's for sure. Nothing is ever free in this country. If it was, then everyone in this world would have everything they wanted, which is not the case. It's like saying, respect is earned, not because you're a family member, a manager at work, etc. I know as I'm typing this, I may sound a bit liberal, but I'm still republican. Better said, I'm not your usual conservative republican, but I'm a liberal republican. I feel people have the right to voice their opinion whether you like it, or not. Why should a liberal democrat in particular be allowed to tell you what to do? They're people just the rest of us. They're not in the top of the world. I mean for anyone who's voting for Hillary Clinton, yes, she'd bring a "stable" USA, but also a country in which us Republicans fear we can't voice our opinion. That's wrong, and shouldn't be allowed. I'm not saying Donald Trump will be the best president ever if he's elected, but the USA definitely needs a cleanup, or better said, an adjustment attitude.

Obama had her covered under our plan till she turns 26. Now she won't have medical insurance at 22.  Obama required insurance companies to not be able to drop a person for pre-existing health problems. A life saver for every person alive!

25 | Phillip Twist | 8 | 10154969243428812_10154969301428812 | Even when he bragged about how much his new property is worth, he is trying to have DC devalue it so he can pay less taxes. Lol he is incredible and those that still believe he will make a difference for the average american paid no attention to everything he has done his entire business life.

"Although I did not die for my son as Lily Potter did, I gave my life for him. I gave up my everyday life (including raising our 2 year old daughter) and laid in a hospital bed for five weeks to give him the opportunity to live. And that gave him protection. The best possible protection, inside of me and receiving a mother's love."

1 | Lorena A Hasbun | 113 | 10154969196288812_10154969235043812 | Good for her. Now, struggling to raise a son with your husband meanwhile you need to be in bed for five weeks? Millions of mothers, grandmothers, aunts and family members do this everyday. Still does NOT give you ( or anybody else) the right to JUDGE another person which has NOT walk in your same shoes.
2 | Melissa Jean Barker | 98 | 10154969196288812_10154969238703812 | Geez ABC the doctor suggested she terminate, he didn't tell her to. They were given options.
3 | Maritza Guevara | 46 | 10154969196288812_10154969318093812 | Good for her.. I am happy that she gets to hold her son. Unfortunately medical circumstances are not the same for everyone. Doctors gave her treatment options. I would think that if all the specialists stated that she would be passing with no options, then the decision would probably being different. Either be available to raise the other children or take the chances.  I respect people decisions. Such if a woman was raped and couldn't deal with such a trauma and continue with the pregnancy (9/months). I wouldn't want the government to make choices on my body. Politicians are not God, doctors, ect.
4 | Jaime Prenatt | 25 | 10154969196288812_10154969344723812 | This story brought tears to my eyes as the memories of the fear, fight, exhaustion and unknown were flowing. I was hospitalized with My youngest at just under 26 weeks and delivered her at 28 weeks. My now 5 year old was delivered at 30 weeks (after 6 weeks of bedrest in the hospital) and both our girls weighed even less than this little one yet are thriving and have no "preemie" problems!  It is truly life-changing when you are part of a miracle and we were blessed to be part of two! God bless this woman for fighting for her son...from one fighting mom to another. ✊🏻🙌🏻💪🏻
5 | Paula George | 19 | 10154969196288812_10154969360508812 | Wow ! I gave up my everyday life to be bedridden for 32 weeks of my pregnancy for my daughter . I was hung upside down and given shots and couldn't even cry when my favorite uncle died during my pregnancy in an effort to not lose her . I gained 100 pounds and could not hold down even watermelon chicken soup most of the pregnancy . When I delivered her after three days of hard labor with huge contractions every three to five minutes she tore me front to back and I had to have 42 stitches .... after we went home she had to be rushed back to the hospital for a week in the NICU. When we survived all those odds I was still violently ill unable to swallow and eat . I hadsevere body pain and several other unpleasant symptoms and wound up being bedridden for three years with undiagnosed severe fibromyalgia . I was in so much pain the first year I could not even hold my precious new baby for long periods of time . When she was three I was finally correctly diagnosed . I worked and fought to get better . I was never able to play with her or chase after and had to watch my mom husband and sister do this . My illness consumed most of her childhood . She is now 14 and two years ago I was blessed with an easy pregnancy , and a beautiful baby who my oldest and I both chase around today as I Have been blessed enough to have worked through the rough spots of my illness . I was in remission for three years and this year had a major setback . My illness started with my pregnancy and I sacrificed years of my life for my baby . My late twenties and all my thirties were a living hell for me and those who loved me .... would I change anything and let myself miscarry like my body tried to do for 32 weeks ? No I wold do it again for my precious angel , you know why ? I'm a mom ! And my kids are my life , today my health is much better and I'm blessed and have an amazing family , it is what WE do! All women who have babies are heros . Everyone of us has a birthing  and pregnancy story that is amazing ! I'm happy for her but celebrate every mom !
6 | Torres Lyn | 5 | 10154969196288812_10154969687188812 | Good for her. I was told the same thing but I chose to lay in a hospital bed for 11 weeks unsure if my baby would even make it, leaving behind my 2 sons with family... ((PPROM at 21 gestational weeks and delivered  32)) Best decision I ever made in my life,  cause now I have My Matthew "Gift of God" ❤
7 | Sway Hobbs | 10 | 10154969196288812_10154969324288812 | I gave up my everyday life to be in the hospital for 3 1/2 months in order to save my twins when they thought it was pointless, yes it was hell, but I would never compare myself to Lily. Not even the same ballpark...
8 | Iris Perez | 3 | 10154969196288812_10154969804298812 | It's awesome she and and family had a choice!And the financial resources to be able to stay in bed for an extended period.
9 | Alicia Cross | 0 | 10154969196288812_10154970241218812 | I am a bit confused as to why this is news. Not that its bad or anything but there are so many that have had to do bed rest. Yes, I was one of them but I am a single mother, bed rest was a huge struggle with 2 disabled children and no one to help me daily. With that said there are more important things to report about.
10 | Crissie Printup | 3 | 10154969196288812_10154969490113812 | I love this story :) brings back memories.... My water broke when I was 28 weeks along. I spent 6 weeks on stricked bedrest in the hospital with 2 children at home. My Dylan was born very healthy at 34 weeks and came home 6 days later. But the thought of what his outcome could of been is upsetting.

20 | Corine Sanchez | 2 | 10154969141863812_568269246691432 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote this letter-Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!Copy Paste Share! Had to share this

1 | Gideon Jooste | 0 | 10154969124538812_10154969176778812 | Reporters from the Swedish weekly newspaper Nya Tider (New Times) have traveled to South Africa to investigate whether the “Rainbow Nation” is the success story that Swedish establishment media sometimes say – as far as they are at all interested in the land that has been in the media focal point until 1994. We met with politicians, farmers and victims. Thousands of farmers have been murdered in the Rainbow Nation, and the fear is always present.The sun shines low over the red-colored, dry ground. I am currently in South Africa, a land of contrasts with a history out of the ordinary. During the day, I met the country’s former interior minister for a meeting about the country and its challenges. Zulu Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi confirmed what I have written about for years, namely the difficult situation that the country’s white farmers are in. Mr. Buthelezi said that he fully understands that the white farmers are frightened in South Africa of today. There is every reason for it.Since the ANC took power in South Africa in 1994, thanks to extensive financial and moral support from the Swedish government, several thousand white farmers have fallen victim to farm attacks, according to the American organization Genocide Watch. The topic is controversial, especially for us in the Western world. To speak of vulnerable minorities is certainly always appreciated, but not when it comes to a minority originating from the Netherlands and neighboring countries from the beginning. Then the question becomes suddenly very sensitive.I strongly believe in every ethnical groups right to live in accordance with their culture and traditions. After traveling around in South Africa for long periods and after reporting from war torn countries in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, you quickly realize the value of security and peace. Civilized and non-corrupt governments, ethnical groups whose rights are recognized and nations that are not exploited by foreign interests are of paramount importance for a just world.A forgotten minority.

One of the many children who will grow up in a squatter camp in South Africa. Picture from Pretoria. Photo: Nya Tider / Free West mediaDuring a five year period, I have traveled to South Africa several times, visiting farms and farmers to document farm attacks. During this latest trip, I have spoken with the victims of those attacks, as well as with relatives of people murdered in the most heinous acts. What is remarkable in these stories is that in many cases it is not about robbery. It would have been much easier for perpetrators to clear the home when no one is home, but still they wait until the owners come back. What happens then is in too many cases that the woman in the house is raped in front of the husband, and that one or more is killed – sometimes the whole family. On a farm I visited in Randfontein outside Johannesburg in mid-March the whole family was killed, and there was still money left on the bloody bed where an elderly man was beaten to death. The only thing taken after the murders was a car, but it was set on fire a few kilometers away. The trend is similar in many of the cases we have examined.Many white farmers are worried about the political developments in South Africa. The radical party Economic Freedom Fighters, who want to seize most, if not all, of the white farmers’ land, is gaining ground. They received six percent of the votes in its first election two years ago. I met with their representatives in Cape Town a couple of days ago, and they were confident that the party will be governing in a not too distant future. Party leader Julius Malema made himself known to an international audience when he, then as leader of the ANC Youth League, sang a song about killing white farmers. Human rights activist Dan Roodt, born in South Africa, says that the situation of the white minority has become worse since Nelson Mandela – a restraining factor – died two years ago. Attacks are now more and more brutal. Most white farmers know someone or know of someone who has fallen victim to an attack. The fear has spread in the rural communities.Blacks have grown to 90 percent of the population and there is little interest in protecting the white minority’s interests. On the contrary, today there are more racial laws than during apartheid. Businesses owned by blacks get preferential access to government contracts, there are laws requiring black ownership in large companies and many whites are locked out of universities because “their” quota is full.Five years ago I visited a farmer community outside the city of Nylstroom and two years ago I did a follow-up. When I came to the same area again last week, I was met by several tragic news. Several attacks have occurred in the neighborhood. An elderly couple had been murdered in their home, the older woman had been raped and burned up. The perpetrators had left empty liquor bottles at the scene and set fire to the house before they set off. We spoke with a 28-year-old woman who lost her husband in a farm attack that took place outside Nylstroom at the end of last year. This was the second husband the young woman had lost. The perpetrators had broken into the house when the couple slept and stabbed her husband to death with a screwdriver. The woman grabbed a knife and fought for her life, thus escaping being raped, but she was also badly cut. The perpetrators held a knife to the couple’s infant to force the mother to open the gun cabinet and then murdered her husband when his four-year daughter watched.Many white farmers would naturally flee South Africa if they could. However, most are settled in the country for economic reasons, including an elderly lady I spoke with, whose daughter had been stabbed to death eight months ago. She had been stabbed with a knife in front of her two little boys. The elderly woman now wants to move to Europe or Australia, but has no economic opportunity to even move to a safer part of South Africa.In Sweden, we are constantly told that there are no Swedes, that a “privileged white” person cannot become a victim of racism. The same attitude towards whites that is prevalient in the West, we also see when it comes to South Africa’s white minority. The official viewpoint is that it simply cannot exist any racism against whites, that the attacks against whites simply are a matter of common robbery, despite the statistics and that the farmers themselves suggest otherwise. When I met the press spokesman of the Transvaal Agricultural Union, Henk van de Graaf, he told me that the most dangerous profession in the crime ridden South Africa is being a farmer. More people have been murdered here than in neighboring Zimbabwe, where the regime deliberately hunted white farmers out of the country.We must dare to talk about the attacks against the white minority in South Africa, just as we need to talk about racism against the Swedes in my home country without being labeled as “racists”. In the upcoming issue of New Times, readers will find stories and interviews with victims and politicians from South Africa.Sanna Hill – Free West Media

Donald J. Trump encourages early voters in Wisconsin to change their ballots. “A lot of stuff has come out since you voted.”
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Bobby Lamb | 462 | 10154969058458812_10154969071993812 | Trump misinforms the electorate, degrades trust in public institutions with conspiracy theories, and promotes willful delusion over engagement with reality. If elected, he poses a unique danger to the functioning of democratic and economic institutions, and to the prosperity of the country.
2 | Danny Babcock | 308 | 10154969058458812_10154969067328812 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote this letter-Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!Copy Paste Share!

5 | Joshua Weiner | 80 | 10154969058458812_10154969129913812 | Trump is a man with a vision for America, not a specific vision, a great vision...the best vision...Trump has a plan to make this country great again....What plan??....a great plan...a plan that will work because it's the best plan.....Why???... because Trump knows good people...which people???....the best people....people that are not stupid like other people....people who know how to get deals done...what deals???...great deals...the biggest deals... because I know words... What words???...I have the best words... I get my information from watching TV... I consult with myself because I have a great brain... A great brain???...the best brain...Trump will also build a big wall to keep Mexicans out and he will make Mexico pay for it!...How....??? its all part of the great plan!...ISIS will be gone very, very quickly...How???... I won't tell you.. It's a secret !!!... This guy is a “one-man circle jerk” and he is only about entertaining the uneducated who love him and his great plan. He's all air - no substance.

8 | Linda Roy | 34 | 10154969058458812_10154969137003812 | Is he trying to convince the people to break the law, the voting rules? He is breaking the rule by voting twice. Voting forms are equal to the numbers of registered voters in every precinct, so once you filled up your form you can not repeat and repeat taking another form if you got a mistake. Imagining of a president who will convince the Americans of breaking the law?......... For his interest? Don't be fooled by another fool who disregards the law.

12 | Venus Bristow | 30 | 10154969058458812_10154969133663812 | Why did Hillary Campaign encourage early voting? Because they know anything can happen with what leaks out on their corruption. #Neverkillary
13 | Connie Meyer Gregory | 8 | 10154969058458812_10154969336573812 | I heard this last night about Wisconsin, and was in disbelief! How the heck should any state allow a 'do-over' after a ballot has been cast? This is shameful.
14 | Ganesh K. Nathan | 49 | 10154969058458812_10154969081718812 | Nothing has actually changed, Trump is still a tax cheat, has assaulted dozens of women & His Trump University fraud trial is coming up.He is still a totally unqualified clown
15 | Butch Wittman | 5 | 10154969058458812_10154969336588812 | So I guess if Trump's elected it will be ok to just walk around and "Grab them by the pu- - y" like he says he does...well he might get Weiners vote:)

11 | Matt Matson | 0 | 10154968954798812_10154968993748812 | Here is something democrats and most of the media have a hard time honestly responding to....all the things said about Trump people say are criminal, from ties with Russia, his taxes, women he was said to have sexual grouped, bankruptcy or whatever....consider these undisputed facts...Obama and most democratic congressman hate him....if there was even the slightest bit of evidence all it takes is the president, or a congressman to present that to the FBI or DOJ and he would be under criminal investigation as a first step. Trump has never been under criminal investigation. People can get just about as many people for money or other reasons to say something bad about anyone...the media used to only say so and so said something about someone if it was news worthy. They would say their is no criminal investigation and the story would be dropped unless a criminal investigation happened.

Outsourcing of U.S. jobs and illegal immigration are the result of foreign trade policy that focuses on business interests while ignoring workers' rights and the environment protection. We don't have to build a wall. The answer is to gradually increase wages and regulations abroad not lower them here.We need to get the influence of business out of politics. Higher wages and buying power will actually increase sales for businesses and expand the economy.Local and State "Berniecrats" and Jill Stein For President

Pope Francis was asked by a reporter whether the Catholic Church might someday ordain women priests. "The last word was clear and was given by St. John Paul II and this remains," he said. "This remains."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Phillip Sanchez | 89 | 10154968750633812_10154968829503812 | Women may not be ordained but all females, women, elderly ladies & young girls still play a pivotal role as members of our Mother Church & valued just like any man, elderly fellas & young boys. The Roman Catholic Church does not suppress women!
2 | Matthew William | 90 | 10154968750633812_10154968793808812 | I just want to know why it's a taboo for me to spread my beliefs as an atheist, but it's okay for some jerkoffs to ring my doorbell at dinner time to tell me about this supposed "god".  How would you feel if I knocked on your door and told you that you're full of sh*t......just wondering....
3 | Colleen Casey | 17 | 10154968750633812_10154968799048812 | It is my hope that women can be ordained as priests, and that all priests can marry if they so choose. Celibacy: wasn't this mandated so that the Priest's heirs couldn't inherit their land, and therefore, go to the church's coffers instead? Do you believe the church is a safe haven for predators? Expose Priests who molested children once and for all. Expose the truth. I adore this Pope, and I hope he continues to unearth truth.
4 | Dennis Ravy | 14 | 10154968750633812_10154968795208812 | Discrimination against women runs deep in most all religions! Why is that? There are more made up lies against Hillary than there were against President Obama! Women should be outraged!
5 | John Zutell | 13 | 10154968750633812_10154968944748812 | This is why the church is seeing a massive decline in membership. It is a Men only club. Please the church view on women influnce politics. That is why women are not treated fairly in the work place.
6 | Adam Michael Geerdes | 15 | 10154968750633812_10154968817593812 | Perhaps they're afraid an ordained female priest might steal the hearts of all the young boys and leave none left for the male priests.
7 | Dawn Mitchell | 8 | 10154968750633812_10154969449933812 | He is following scripture! I'm not Catholic but I am a follower of Christ and the answers to all your questions of why are in the Bible. I don't understand why people, humans think they have a right to change one word of what God created. SMH if YOU have a problem with it, it's not with the Church, Catholic or otherwise , YOU have a problem with God.
8 | Scott Whaley | 24 | 10154968750633812_10154968755888812 | No, HE doesn't rule it out, Scripture does. He is not the final arbiter of God's word, God is. That's no offense to him, just truth.
9 | Marita Bone | 1 | 10154968750633812_10154969729628812 | 😡 this church has a lot of problems , they are loosing people including myself !! You better get with the 21 st century or there will be no Catholic Church left !! This rule was invented by the Bishops hundred of years ago !! Time to put an end to it !
10 | Paul Bramble | 3 | 10154968750633812_10154969761808812 | This is why I know religion is man made. Our creator is not bias in anyway shape or form. The Catholic Church is the perfect example of the few lording over the meek and ignorant. Woman can and should be included in any and all of everything. Grow up people
11 | Irma Andrade | 1 | 10154968750633812_10154969659328812 | The Catholic church needs to make a lot of changes. They are stuck on the old testament!  I no longer go to a Catholic church I'm really disappointed. Especially with all the child molestation cases!
12 | Irma Andrade | 0 | 10154968750633812_10154969718958812 | I want to attend a church where everyone is welcomed!  My son who is now 9 yrs old has been attending Christian masses since he was in my belly.  He was raised in a  Christian church. Our church 💒 has a blessed choir and we pray a lot.  He noticed the difference once that I took him to a Catholic baptism. IT was my brothers baby girl.  My son Carlos was shocked he asked me, " where are the angels singing 🎶 I don't see them" that was a shocker to me. He only sees The Angels with our church choir.
13 | Mark N Franciesca Fruge | 0 | 10154968750633812_10154970211178812 | I am ordained and it will stay that way.. My life is about God and loving and giving.. I'm a woman ..the pope has no right to make decisions .. he's just a man.. Not God..
14 | Irma Andrade | 0 | 10154968750633812_10154969393403812 | The am very disappointed in the Pope & the Catholic church. They say they are Christians hum don't seem like it to me.  That's why I don't go to Catholic church anymore I now attend a real Christian church where women ate allowed to be leaders! Stop the discrimation of women as leaders. We have been the leaders of our own families we are made to lead. Its time for a change!
15 | Keisha Johnson | 3 | 10154968750633812_10154968923338812 | the anointing comes only from God to use women,and we have plenty of female Pastors...the Pope might be anointed too,but He can't prohibit that women become Pastors in the Catholic Church...like i said,the calling comes from God alone,not from man..
16 | Rebecca Smith | 2 | 10154968750633812_10154969605853812 | There is no such thing as an atheist!  Everyone worships a God.... for some.... their "God" is science, money or power or something else.... and for others it is the God who created the heavens and the earth.
17 | Angie Haney | 5 | 10154968750633812_10154969234753812 | I am not a Catholic , but I am a woman who still believes that only men should be a Minister. I also believe that a woman should not be President. I don't feel that as a woman that I have ever been mistreated in a work environment or denied a position because of my status. Just my belief! May God Bless!
18 | Maritza Argueta | 1 | 10154968750633812_10154969657713812 | This is why I love my Catholic Faith!🤗 We, women have already an important role in the church. Thank you Pope Francis!
19 | Juan Guzman | 3 | 10154968750633812_10154969518613812 | The modern day religion is obsolete and it is the poison that runs through the planets veins. Not just Christianity, but all religions must go. There may very well be a god, but the true God is not the one in any religious texts. Truth is, the modern day religions are the equivalent of the false idol as described in the book of revelations. God doesn't hate, doesn't love, nor does  it intervene. It simply is, and it is up to your moral compass and sense of empathy to decide what's good or bad.
20 | Irma Andrade | 0 | 10154968750633812_10154969918568812 | I love God more then a religion!  I can find God anywhere in my own home 🏠. All you gotta do is talk to him like to a friend. I do everyday I don't need a church just God! I've been Catholic since I was a kid. I didn't feel Gods presence until I had a spiritual encounter and it wasn't at church.
21 | Marti Salazar | 0 | 10154968750633812_10154970270913812 | I agree. I'm a Catholic woman and I have given this a lot of thought. I feel that men and women need interaction on an intellectual level with each other. We don't all need to pair up, have coitus and reproduce. You will say that I'm promoting inequality. It's not about inequality, it's about putting value on our ministers. Women, nuns don't have to be the ones doing the job of priest in order to fully serve the Lord. I think if women become priests, then they will value men less or just not at all. God didn't make men to be alone and He didn't make women to be all alone, either.
22 | Dana Pekarchick | 0 | 10154968750633812_10154969583878812 | This is why I no longer attend Mass and refuse to follow religious induced doctrines. I can believe in a higher power without the necessity of an 'interpreter'!

The Donald J. Trump campaign appears to be operating optimistically in the final week of the presidential campaign. The clearest sign of that comes in the form of a $25 million ad buy that includes new spots in Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Mexico, all of which are classified as leaning Democratic in the current ABC News state ratings.

6 | Jeanne Fancher | 19 | 10154968671628812_10154968694228812 | So reporting on "buying ads" is the best the national "news" media can do? How about an in-depth look at his policies, party platfom, and  KKK supporters and, to be fair, at his Opponent's policies, platform and supporters?

9 | Wanda Kinzeler | 7 | 10154968671628812_10154968846003812 | Is it ethical for George Stephanopoulos to be a reporter for ABC News on the presidential campaign when he has had such close ties to the Clinton and donated more money then many American households make in one year to the Clinton Foundation?
10 | Wendell Davis | 11 | 10154968671628812_10154968722928812 | DONALD J. TRUMP CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER“Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC:•	FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress;•	SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health);•	THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated;•	FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service;•	FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government;•	SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.On the same day, I will begin taking the following seven actions to protect American workers:•	FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 •	SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership•	THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator•	FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately•	FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.•	SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward•	SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law:•	FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama•	SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States•	THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities•	FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back•	FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting.Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration:1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.2. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral.4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars.9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics.On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government.This is my pledge to you.And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people.”

20 | Dqs Veron | 2 | 10154968671628812_10154969143393812 | What I am about to tell you are facts:Only Donald Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women.

Only Donald Trump has gone bankrupt six times. Only Donald Trump has openly used donations to veterans collected then deposited to his personal and illegal foundation and use that money to pay for lawsuit settlements, but a self portrait, a signed football helmet and "donate" to the Florida attorney general so she wouldn't open and investigation in to the plethora of fraud complaints against his so called trump university.

Only Donald Trump has called women fat, pigs and disgusting etc. Only Donald Trump blames the media for publicizing things that come out of his own mouth. Only Donald Trump has said he will support a peaceful transition of power but only if he wins. Only Donald Trump talks about keeping jobs in the US then sends his own company's jobs overseas. Only Donald Trump talks about the importance of improving the state of our economy and then used steel from china and room furniture and accessories from foreign countries to build and furnish his hotels.Should I go on? I still have the pending FBI investigation in to Trumps business dealing and campaign solicitation schemes! 😱Written by a guy who did his homework😊
21 | Jill Reynolds | 1 | 10154968671628812_10154968959698812 | I feel sorry for the people in Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Mexico! Wonder if he knows New Mexico is different from Mexico 🤔.

24 | Michael Condee | 1 | 10154968671628812_10154968674193812 | CRITICAL LIFE LESSON ."Do you know how to catch wild pigs?".There was a chemistry professor in a large college that had some exchange students in the class. One day while the class was in the lab, the professor noticed one young man, an exchange student, who kept rubbing his back and stretching as if his back hurt.The professor asked the young man what was the matter. The student told him he had a bullet lodged in his back. He had been shot while fighting communists in his native country who were trying to overthrow his country's government and install a new communist regime. In the midst of his story, he looked at the professor and asked a strange question. He asked: "Do you know how to catch wild pigs?"The professor thought it was a joke and asked for the punch line. The young man said that it was no joke. "You catch wild pigs by finding a suitable place in the woods and putting corn on the ground. The pigs find it and begin to come every day to eat the free food"."When they are used to coming every day, you put a fence down one side of the place where they are used to coming. When they get used to the fence, they begin to eat the corn again and you put up another side of the fence". "They get used to that and start to eat again.You continue until you have all four sides of the fence up with a gate in the last side". "The pigs, which are used to the free corn, start to come through the gate to eat that free corn again. You then slam the gate on them and catch the whole herd"."Suddenly the wild pigs have lost their freedom. They run around and around inside the fence, but they are caught. Soon they go back to eating the free corn. They are so used to it that they have forgotten how to forage in the woods for themselves, so they accept their captivity."The young man then told the professor that is exactly what he sees happening in America . The government keeps pushing us toward Communism/Socialism and keeps spreading the free corn out in the form of programs such as supplemental income, tax credit for unearned income, tax exemptions, tobacco subsidies, dairy subsidies, payments not to plant crops (CRP), welfare entitlements, medicine, drugs, etc., while we continually lose our freedoms, just a little at a time as the government forces us to participate in many of these programs whether or not we want to.One should always remember two truths: There is no such thing as a free lunch, and you can never hire someone to provide a service for you cheaper than you can do it yourself. If you see that all of this wonderful government "help" is a problem confronting the future of democracy in America, you might want to share this with your friends.  God help us all when the gate slams shut!Quote for today: "The problems we face today are there because the people who work for a living are now outnumbered by those that vote for a living."
25 | Michele Riv | 0 | 10154968671628812_10154969584823812 | Too bad he wait until I favorable situation to fight for the presidency.

2 | Alexander Rinard | 162 | 10154968634553812_10154968672423812 | Trump used a method that was perfectly legal during the time he utilized it? Unthinkable! Typical liberal media, so desperate to make someone look bad they don't even think of what they're saying.

No one with the slightest bit of rationale would ever report this kind of garbage that you people try to shove down the American citizen's throats. If you all love Hillary so much...find a cell near hers and go live with her. We want to be free of her and her crimes. We deserve better than Hillary and we deserve better from ABC News.

18 | Mary Ryles | 7 | 10154968634553812_10154968688578812 | Oh Please..tell me about the people in the House who made and passed the tax loop holes that allows Trump and EVERY wealthy person to do this.. THAT is much more interesting to me.
19 | William Holliker | 7 | 10154968634553812_10154968857623812 | Most people are ignorant of tax laws because they fill out a short form, take the standard deduction, and think their refund is money the government gives them (not realizing it is money the government took at first). If they can. they also take, if they can, other deductions, such as mortgage interest, child credit, educational, medical, state and local taxes, etc. I wonder how many people who file long form to reduce their taxes would instead file short form so they could pay more?If you own a business, you get to take all sorts of additional legal deductions. Trump would be nuts to file a short form given all of his businesses. Apparently he has never been called into question by the IRS because we have never seen any reports of it, and we all know the media and democrats would jump right on that and demand he be put in prison.I respect Trump for taking all the deductions he can to avoid paying more tax than he should. First, it shows smart business savvy, something this country really needs. Second, it helps to reduce government waste by not giving them money to waste. The only people that are really upset are the freeloaders if you have not noticed.

21 | Kenn Brix Sørensen | 1 | 10154968634553812_10154968823138812 | The never ending Soapie - it is both comical but also very tragic how the presidential election has evolved through time, but at this election it will reach new highs. Regardless of which of the candidates is elected, the US and the majority of the American people will be the losers and the stinky rich and the corrupted will be the winners. The election is already corrupted by people like the head of the FBI and others with power and with 'special' interests – they are pulling strings they shouldn’t be pulling, to influence the outcome of the election.
22 | Ellen Messer | 3 | 10154968634553812_10154969661533812 | Tax loophole??? If there is one I'd use it too !!!, the tax law gave the loophole, not Trump !, he just legally utilized it !!! 😏 I'll use Hillary's words .... Move on nothing to see here !!!!
23 | Pamela Schilke | 2 | 10154968634553812_10154969761418812 | If this is all you got you have nothing ABC. Why aren't you reporting on the real story of corruption like the Clinton foundation being under heavy FBI investigation for the most corruption in American History?!
24 | Donald Chase | 6 | 10154968634553812_10154968718698812 | Hey Dumba$$e$ were they legal at the time? That is all that matters, no one in their right mind wants to pay a penny more than necessary that is why we pay millions of dollars every year for some ne to minimize our taxes!
25 | Matt Bishop | 3 | 10154968634553812_10154969785688812 | That's the same loophole the New York Times used themselves right? The fact that liberals and the media are fighting so hard to take Donald down should show you how close this race really is.
