Voters are using a strategy called vote swapping to try to increase their impact on swing states.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Von Teilour | 21 | 10154735571263675_10154736030798675 | If orchestrated properly, this practice might elevate our number of viable parties to four, maybe five.  Which would more accurately reflect citizens in this country, instead of the current duopoly.
2 | Georgie McGeorge | 21 | 10154735571263675_10154736072413675 | National. Popular. Vote. The Electoral College is hugely responsible for so many voters not giving a flip. It's dumb, and old, and needs to go away.
3 | James Strickland | 1 | 10154735571263675_10154736154478675 | For everyone who is saying "how can you trust the other person?"  Well, obviously that is a problem, but if you saw the actual video, you'd know that the case they showed had the two people meeting in person and filling out the mail-in ballots together.  They then both went to the mailbox.  So, it is possible to know that the other person did what they said they would do.  (FWIW I think this idea is shady, but maybe it will eventually force a more sensible voting system.  The current system, with the focus on only "swing states", is not very democratic.)
4 | Audrey Choden | 0 | 10154735571263675_10154736117628675 | I watched two guys swap votes on PBS Newshour program and was surprised to find out that the practice is legal as long as no money changes hands.

8 | Humberto Capiro | 1 | 10154735571263675_10154736118298675 | In Defense of the Electoral College - Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president. - By Richard A. Posner - The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disfranchised‚Äîto feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn‚Äôt their president.  http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2012/11/defending_the_electoral_college.html

11 | William House | 0 | 10154735571263675_10154736111908675 | What Went Wrong‚Äîand Right‚Äîwith Reagan‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmnesty‚ÄùBy Matthew Soerens November 6, 2011 ...The problem is that since IRCA did not adequately address the fundamental flaws in our legal immigration system by tying the number of work-based visas available to the needs of the labor market, employers and their lobbies in D.C. pushed back against employer sanction provisions of IRCA. They argued that, without access to unauthorized immigrant labor and without new mechanisms to obtain authorized immigrant labor, their businesses could not succeed.  It took very little time after IRCA‚Äôs passage for companies to find ways around these employer sanction provisions, hiring workers as ‚Äúsub-contractors‚Äù rather than employees in some cases, and resisting efforts to create less-easily falsifiable documents while arguing that they could not be expected to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent documents.  Employment agencies have flourished, allowing corporations to essentially outsource their legal liability, because they simply contract with the employment agency and are not themselves responsible for verifying their workers‚Äô legal status.  With a strong lobby against them, no Administration (Republican or Democratic) has seriously and consistently enforced these employer sanctions.  And since undocumented workers could still find work in the U.S., they still came‚Äîin unprecedented numbers....most corporations simply want adequate workers and would prefer that they have legal status.  The real failure of IRCA was that legislators made it (theoretically) harder to immigrate and work illegally but did not adequately address the fundamental problem: that our antiquated quotas on legal migration were (and still are) entirely out-of-sync with the U.S. labor market.  Most employers would be willing to accept a functional employment authorization system (the technology exists to dramatically minimize fraud, if we wanted to deploy it) if they were guaranteed an adequate flow of legal workers. All that said, it‚Äôs also important to highlight where IRCA did not fail.  The ‚Äúamnesty‚Äù provision, which President Reagan said as he signed the bill would ‚Äúgo far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society,‚Äù did just that.  As a legal counselor, I‚Äôve helped hundreds of immigrants who were granted legal status through IRCA to naturalize and become proud American citizens.  Almost all those who legalized were able to improve their economic situation, which meant (beyond the benefit to themselves and their children) that they went on to pay much more in taxes than they would have as low-wage undocumented workers.  Many‚Äîfreed to be entrepreneurial in a way that their lack of a Social Security card made nearly impossible‚Äîwent on to start businesses, reinvigorating the local economies of many communities...See full article AMNESTY NOW DEFEAT THE REPUBLICAN KKK EVERYWHERE

This litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, and identification of Plaintiff would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to her and to others. Exh. A. All of the ten factors that the Second Circuit articulated as relevant to this analysis favor anonymity, especially factors 1-4, 7, and 10 (e.g., factors one and two: ‚Äúwhether the litigation involves matters that are ‚Äòhighly sensitive and [of a] personal nature,‚Äô‚Äù and ‚Äú‚Äôwhether identification poses a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm to the ... party [seeking to proceed anonymously] or even more critically, to innocent non-parties‚Äô‚Äù.), or are neutral with respect to anonymity. Protecting Plaintiff‚Äôs anonymity is also appropriate as she is a rape victim.9.Plaintiff was enticed by promises of money and a modeling career to attend aseries of parties, with other similarly situated minor females, held at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein. At least four of the parties were attended by Defendant Trump. Exhs. A and B. On information and belief, by this time in 1994, Defendant 4Trump had known Defendant Epstein for seven years ( New York, 10/28/02), and knew that Plaintiff was then just 13 years old. Exhs. A and B.10.Defendant Trump initiated sexual contact with Plaintiff at four different parties. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff‚Äôs pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. Exhs. A andB.11.Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened Plaintiff that, were she ever to reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse of her by Defendant Trump, Plaintiff and her family would be physically harmed if not killed. Exhs. A and B.12.Defendant Epstein had sexual contact with Plaintiff at two of the parties. The second sexual encounter with Defendant Epstein took place after Plaintiff had been raped by Defendant Trump. Defendant Epstein forced himself upon Plaintiff and proceeded to rape her anally and vaginally despite her loud pleas to stop. Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike Plaintiff about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at Plaintiff that he, Defendant Epstein, rather than Defendant Trump, should have been the one who took Plaintiff‚Äôs virginity, before Plaintiff finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein. Exhs. A andB.13.The threats of violence against Plaintiff and her family continued, this time from Defendant Epstein, who again reiterated that Plaintiff was not to reveal any of the details of his sexual and physical abuse of her or else, specifically, Plaintiff and her family would be seriously physically harmed, if not killed.

Melania Trump has always maintained that she arrived in the country legally and never violated the terms of her immigration status.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jameel Fleming | 233 | 10154735590193675_10154735593518675 | Obviously it's okay because she's white and beautiful.  Oh, and she's tall...and now she's rich.
2 | Original Tea Party | 185 | 10154735590193675_10154735598403675 | She needs to go back and get in line like everybody else, but since she violated the terms of her visa - she doesn't get to be in line at all. #sendherback
3 | Rod Drew | 58 | 10154735590193675_10154735660803675 | Ok... i don't like Trump... but this woman is obviously too ignorant and/or stupid to know just what the hell is going on around her. I'm certain she was told everything was legitimate by her husband. After all, he would NEVER LIE to her, would he?
4 | Cynthia Gray | 90 | 10154735590193675_10154735609988675 | Can you say white illegal worker? This after trump menaced President Obama with his relentless and baseless birther attacks.
5 | Deb Chan | 47 | 10154735590193675_10154735686688675 | If some people don't care that Trump has been accused of sexual assault and harassment numerous times, has made some very racist and misogynist comments, filed bankruptcy numerous times despite saying he is a very successful businessman, refused to reveal his financial statements after promising he would make them public , ...then really why would those same people care about her working without her visa? Just saying...
6 | Joseph Munoz | 40 | 10154735590193675_10154735778933675 | Very simple solution according to her husband's plan... retroactive annulment of her citizenship, immediate deportation, and complete denial of any future entry to the country... Oh, and don't forget the criminal record for violation of immigration laws!#nowhiteprivelige
7 | Gabriel Robbie Montoya | 23 | 10154735590193675_10154735813483675 | That's ok because she is not brown skinned... racist republicans only care if brown skinned immigrants illegally work in this country... let's be clear this has never been about  laws or work permits... it's always been about race and their hate for blacks and brown people
8 | Linda Beynon | 25 | 10154735590193675_10154735838883675 | Fascinating that she has characterized her early job as a nude model as being a "young entrepreneur." She has enjoyed quite a successful career path from porn photos to adultress/mistress of a married Trump, to wife of candidate Trump living in a gilded universe. I wish her peace and happiness somewhere far away from the White House with her hypocritical philandering husband.
9 | Stephany Kleinberg | 17 | 10154735590193675_10154735709613675 | Me thinks this high dollar party favor for well heeled gentlemen has overstayed her welcome. Don't worry trump supporters, she'll show you her boobs (again) soon enough. It is after all what a rent girl does.
10 | Shanti Vani | 13 | 10154735590193675_10154735793143675 | Melania did work without permission when she came here and received more than $20,000 while breaking the law. Problem is she has claimed she didn't violate any immigration laws. üôÑ
11 | Whitney Fields | 12 | 10154735590193675_10154735811528675 | Iffy Azalea was here illegally for years before she got a work visa. If you're a white illegal, you move through America differently than illegals with brown skin. Some of you won't like that I said that but it's so true. She even laughed about it in an interview.
12 | Blake Houser | 4 | 10154735590193675_10154735823518675 | I watched her speech and was surprised how poor her English was for having lived here as long as she has. She has been here for over 15 years but you would never think that after hearing her speak.
13 | Alfil Kemper | 3 | 10154735590193675_10154735874783675 | Heh, no worries; she's white & beautiful, all is forgiven. --- By the way... this is sarcasm on my part - We seem to forget our northern border or that whites DO come into this country illigally & DO take our jobs!!!
14 | Renee Ekleberry | 16 | 10154735590193675_10154735752533675 | We knew this MONTHS ago - did ANYONE in the MEDIA think it might be important enough to SHARE before NOW. - Hell, NO - They were too busy babbling about whatever Trump distraction was served up to them that day. Any news on the TAXES yet, MEDIA??? ANY NEWS on the child rape? Yeah, I know - you'll get to it in December - 2019.
15 | Thomas Helsel | 7 | 10154735590193675_10154735813118675 | This is a pretty stupid story. First she wasn't here illegally she had a visa that allowed her to enter and look for work in the US. Then she applied for a work visa but landed a paying gig before her work visa was fully processed. It's really more a case of bad timing than anything else. At least she was here legally and was going through the proper process.
16 | Wendy NuyoKrican | 3 | 10154735590193675_10154736019768675 | Who cares? I really don't like Trump but this is an non-issue. She could have worked as a call girl for the elite; it's on her not us. But yeah, it is somewhat hypocritical of Trump to talk about immigrants. We already know he's only talking about ONE kind of immigrant.
17 | Edward StJean | 3 | 10154735590193675_10154735701843675 | you have Hillary clinton who has siphoned millions off of her supposed no profit foundation, taken huge donations from Qatar and Saudi Arabia which surely impacted her decisions just as they intended, mishandled confidential information and lied to the FBI, and somehow some way we are looking at this?? How can this be possible???Oh wait never mind this is PBS
18 | Maria Saldana | 7 | 10154735590193675_10154735598723675 | Is she an illegal?  Well then, Jeh Johnson has some work to do.., he set up the " Welcoming Committee" here in Texas.. he owes her a special welcome gift.  ... don't trip over the basket now.
19 | Jill Hussar | 5 | 10154735590193675_10154735997383675 | I don't really care about her immigration status. But I do care deeply about what a horrid example she would be as a FLOTUS. A horrible example to young Americans as well. She cannot hide from her pictures posing nude.
20 | Jerry Savage | 10 | 10154735590193675_10154735716838675 | Stealing high paying modeling jobs is fine with deplorables since she's white and attractive. It's the refugees from war torn countries that need to be locked up.
21 | Carol Harper | 1 | 10154735590193675_10154735980263675 | No one cares. Trump and family lie, break laws and so nothing for anyone but themselves and people still think he will look out for him. What a shame!
22 | Original Tea Party | 7 | 10154735590193675_10154735624908675 | If Trump is elected he simply needs to issue a pardon, and she is off the hook, a move his supporters will see as completely devoid of irony, but if Clinton is elected, Melania will be on the first rusty scow back to Slovenia.
23 | Mike Moret | 0 | 10154735590193675_10154736126868675 | Was she legal when she made all her lesbian porn videos? Wonder how she feels about little donny raping that 13 year old. Trial starts in December, lets all hope for guilty.
24 | Peter Fellows | 0 | 10154735590193675_10154736039273675 | What a sick bunch of people with too much time on their hands. The voters have alteady decided and none of this garbage by either side will change any minds. Get a life.
25 | Jerry Villano | 1 | 10154735590193675_10154735840763675 | Melania speaks 5 languages, is a self made female success, is a doting mother and loyal wife. Her concern for children's welfare will be a force for good if she becomes first lady. What our alternative BILL CLINTON the real abuser of women, who will he take care of as first gentleman...women's issues?

Initiate a WWII-scale national mobilization to halt climate change, the greatest threat to humanity in our history. Create 20 million jobs by transitioning to 100% clean renewable energy by 2030, and investing in public transit, sustainable agriculture, conservation and restoration of critical infrastructure, including ecosystems.Implement a Just Transition that empowers those communities and workers most impacted by climate change and the transition to a green economy. Ensure that any worker displaced by the shift away from fossil fuels will receive full income and benefits as they transition to alternative work.Enact energy democracy based on public, community and worker ownership of our energy system. Treat energy as a human right.Redirect research funds from fossil fuels into renewable energy and conservation.  Build a nationwide smart electricity grid that can pool and store power from a diversity of renewable sources, giving the nation clean, democratically-controlled, energy.End destructive energy extraction and associated infrastructure: fracking, tar sands, offshore drilling, oil trains, mountaintop removal, natural gas pipelines, and uranium mines. Halt any investment in fossil fuel infrastructure, including natural gas, and phase out all fossil fuel power plants. Phase out nuclear power and end nuclear subsidies.  End all subsidies for fossil fuels and impose a greenhouse gas fee / tax to charge polluters for the damage they have created.Protect our public lands, water supplies, biological diversity, parks, and pollinators. Ban neonicotinoids and other pesticides that threaten the survival of bees, butterflies, and other pollinators.Support a strong enforceable global climate treaty that limits global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius and provides just financial compensation to developing countries.Label GMOs, and put a moratorium on GMOs and pesticides until they are proven safe.Support organic and regenerative agriculture, permaculture, and sustainable forestry.Protect the rights of future generations.

1 | Francisco Barron | 61 | 10154734942038675_10154735134468675 | It's unbelievable that in 2016 the US is so far behind in the election process compared to other countries, in choosing a president. We must be the laughinstock of the world when they see the antiquated, complicated, backwards, 4th world election system we have in the US.......!
2 | Daphney Waggoner | 33 | 10154734942038675_10154735216078675 | but this is the same court that rescinded the protections against violations of the Voting Rights Act of 1964, that specifically were designed to prevent minority voter suppression. As a result of the Supreme Court gutting the VRA in 2013, Maricopa County reduced polling centers and authorized locations by 30%. Mostly in predominantly minority neighborhoods, which caused wait times at the remaining precincts to soar to an average of 5 hours.  This is blatantly aimed at suppressing minority voters.  The states that are the biggest offenders are: Arizona, Texas, North Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana. Gee, I wonder what these states all have in common? But the focus of this election is the fear of the election being rigged in minority, urban neighborhoods. What a farce.

Republicans have called these laws necessary to guard against voting fraud.Arizona late Friday filed an emergency appeal asking the U.S. Supreme Court to allow it to enforce the law Arizona's legislature approved earlier this year.Plaintiffs in the case, including the Democratic National Committee, argued the law is unconstitutional because it unfairly impacted the ability of minorities to vote.In asking the Supreme Court to deny a stay, the plaintiffs said reinstating the law "would expose Arizonans who are presently engaged in ballot collection and do not learn of this court's ruling to a felony conviction and criminal sanctions."

Right now, cannabis in Northern California is more like a craft brew industry with a lot of independent growers, each of whom buy locally from a large number of local businesses.  That goes away when corporations with strong vertical ties come into the picture.  If this passes as written, many independent farmers will be forced to sell and low wage farm workers will take their place.  Unfortunately, local lawmakers, as well as state, can be very susceptible to the corporate money already at play here.   http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/10/16/4-reasons-californias-marijuana-growers-surprising.aspx

2 | Thea Page | 30 | 10154734616463675_10154734892848675 | It is interesting to see that women are more often ready to give others their choice than men. Is that because we tend to be more realistic and less fearful? Compassionate CHOICES means individuals choose, they make their decisions based on their believe systems. Nobody is forced to end their lives, there is no need to be paranoid

Very important to go to a lecture which gives both sides of this issue, and a vital part of that is a video which shows just what it is really like for the patient when they are all *tubed-up*...often the sites get infected, etc. I feel everyone should be able to make this decision for themselves.

I'm against the death penalty as it is used here. Trusting our Medical profession, i think not. Suicide is not a culturally accepted norm here. Hospice is doing great work. When someone is suffering great pain good judgement is at issue. Doctors prognosis is too often dead wrong. Just sme things to think about
6 | Wendy Baker EA | 1 | 10154734616463675_10154735698963675 | I support "Death with Dignity"! We have been taught all our lives to fear death. To be able to die with dignity in a way that one chooses is an individual choice and right. Only in modern times do we want to prolong life when it is inevitable for our own selfish reasons....whatever those may be. I watched my mother suffer for many years with a variety illnesses, she wished for death and she waited in pain and only existed as long as her body held out, which was many years. She withered and wasted away on  pharmaceutical drugs that only kept her "comfortable" and addicted. If given the choice, I am sure she would have chosen death with dignity. I hope that if I am ever faced with a terminal illness that my family support my decision to die with dignity, celebrate life, do not fear my death!!!

In the end, I held her hand after 17 years of pain and immobility, respiratory failure, opportunistic infections, and misery while she was bound to her bed (full-time for the last 3 years of her life) as she drew her last few ragged breaths.  I knew that I had been wrong to beg her to choose the life that she led for my benefit.

Bad for economy but good for those in the pipeline to keep their gravy train rolling. Trump wants to lower taxes leaving more money in your pocket because you know how to better spend your money than Hillary. Companies not hampered by garbage regulations and a lower corporate tax rates means increased earnings. This is very similar to the Brexit drop which ralied within a week. Mises Institute3 mins ¬∑ The Federal Reserve no action on interest rates this week, making November the 94th month in a row during which the Fed‚Äôs target interest rate is below 1 percent. The lack of movement surprised no one this close to next week‚Äôs election, especially with the Fed‚Äôs current policy as seen to be helping Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential chances (at the expense of the greater economy). Hurting her campaign is the continuing disaster of Obamacare, as government mandates have tainted insurance pools with too much risk, and not enough healthy individuals to balance the cost.Meanwhile, as public referendums on both medicinal and recreational marijuana appear on ballots across the country next week, the Federal government continues to undermine legalization efforts to the benefit of black markets. While Washington itself is beyond repair, it‚Äôs important to recognize the rhetorical tricks being used within the capital to continue to attack your freedoms.

For the estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the U.S., this is a potentially crucial election.

1 | Ray Culver Sr. | 9 | 10154734380888675_10154734876613675 | Alex Schiller/Ray Culver Sr.Donald Trump is a self-absorbed penthouse bully billionaire with a gold toothbrush who has never done anything for anyone but himself; who has no idea whatsoever what it‚Äôs like to be you; who is inexperienced, unqualified, uninformed, disinclined and who will never be interested in you, your family, your sorrows or your needs. He exists to feed his own ego and Freudianly seek his dead father‚Äôs approval. A coronation won‚Äôt solve that. Nevertheless‚Ä¶1) Bill Clinton cheated on his wife. ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúTar and feather that heathen!‚ÄùTrump proudly brags about sexual assault and has cheated on all three wives. ‚Äî‚Äî  ‚ÄúThat little rascal. Boys will be boys.‚Äù2) Hillary oversaw the Department of State when four people were killed in an embassy attack (in part because Republicans short funded embassy security worldwide). ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúLock her up!‚ÄùGeorge W. and Ronald Reagan were in office when over two hundred embassy employees died in attacks. ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúThe price we pay for freedom. ‚ÄòOh say can you see‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äù3) Undocumented immigrants work and pay taxes. ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúRound them up and kick them out!‚ÄùTrump creatively avoids paying millions in taxes. ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúA true patriot!‚Äù4) Hillary‚Äôs foundation spends 87% of its donations helping people around the world. ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a crook!‚ÄùTrump‚Äôs foundation paid his debts, bought a portrait of him - for him - for $20,000, bought him a Tim Tebow autographed helmet for $12,000, and made a $25,000 ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù donation to avoid a Trump U fraud investigation in Florida, while spending less than 5% of its funds on charity (and it was shut down in NY State for fund-raising while it was not registered to do so). ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs ‚ÄòBorn Again‚Äô, ya know.‚ÄùTrump (says he) made $4 billion in forty years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same $14 million "small loan‚Äù from daddy would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, without thousands of lawsuits, without scores of stiffed small businesses. ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a financial wizard!‚Äù5) Hillary claimed a loss of $700k in 2015. ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúLock her up!‚ÄùTrump is the first candidate in over forty years not to release tax returns; which would likely reveal - a) his financial entanglement with foreign governments - b) that he is not nearly as philanthropic as he claims to be - c) that he is not nearly as wealthy as he claims to be - d) that he has scammed us all out of millions in tax dollars. ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you just love his Pakistani made signature ties?‚ÄùAnd, in 1995 he took a $916 million loss while managing three casinos in the middle of the Atlantic City boom - (incompetent much?) - that we only know about because someone ratted him out. ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúI used to take Tupperware to the free buffet!‚Äù6) Hillary takes responsibility for and apologizes for private email servers she foolishly allowed. ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúLock her up!‚ÄùTrump‚Äôs companies over the years have destroyed thousands of emails in defiance of court orders. Also, Trump has repeatedly denied saying things that were witnessed by thousands, that were recorded in front of thousands; a screaming display of narcissism.  ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúI just love how he hates who I hate!‚ÄùMillions cannot define the word ‚Äútruth.‚Äù Millions cannot appreciate that assertions, allegations, denials and declarations must be verified; must be confirmed. Millions of opinions are shaped by memes, thirty-second soundbites and manic staccato rhetoric that play to emotions, fears and prejudices. Millions have no thirst, or even tolerance, for knowledge.Millions who would follow Donald Trump (off a cliff) are of a reality TV ilk who consider themselves smart and well informed, not because of the exhaustive research they‚Äôve done to formulate their opinions (learning, for instance, that manufacturing jobs are never coming back; that more undocumented are leaving than are coming - two issues Trump has repeatedly lied about), but because of their acceptance into like-minded, intellectually lazy circles, content with espousing the hearsay and uninformed conclusions of others as their own truth.Millions more, on the other hand, require hard, cold evidence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hearing from many people‚Äù - ‚Äúbelieve me this is the truth‚Äù - ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a criminal‚Äù ‚Äî is not evidence - or evidence of evidence.click - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism#Traits_and_signs

You know what, I came to this country as a legal immigrant, received Green Card - on the basis of US National Interest due to the research work i had been doing, and then became a naturalized US Citizen. And I always respected the laws of this country. Living in California, I had at least one instance when Democratic propagandists knocked on our door when we were still on GC; and to our remark that by law we do not vote (yet) they said - No prob! - just fill out our form, and go vote. Now PBS who receives approx. $400M+ from our taxes is promoting a full disregard of the law. I think PBS should be closed down, at least in its current form.

A federal judge has ordered local elections boards in North Carolina to restore voters to the rolls after they were purged too close to Election Day.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ed Skinner | 232 | 10154732883243675_10154734276888675 | The GOP can't win without gerrymandering and voter disenfranchisement and they know it.
2 | Col√®re Fille Meyer | 112 | 10154732883243675_10154734325068675 | Glad to see an American Court seeing through the "Good Old Putin" Party's tactics to use our government against us to mess with our sacred right to vote. Conway the campaign manager has been all over the media bragging about Trump‚Äôs strategy to specifically target Black American Voters. They have a set menu of intimidation tactics at different levels ranging from dejection to fear. They know Black Americans have real power in the voting booth and they fear this more than anything. You can't stop and frisk a Black voter at the Polls, though governors like mine in FL refuse to restore voting rights in overwhelming numbers to Black Floridians who have paid their debt to the State. A week before the election the KKK endorses Trump, and then a Black Church in Mississippi is burned down. Now they‚Äôve switched to the soft sell by continuing to plant stories filled manipulated statistics about Black voters, (I didn‚Äôt see a check box for race on my ballot), with inserted blame and shame comments using coded racist language that their base understands very clearly.I think that Black Voters know their power and will exercise it with vigor.
3 | Robyn Rogers | 22 | 10154732883243675_10154734489073675 | Trump is solely responsible for the visceral hatred we're seeing. This has never happened before. He's so stupid and vacant I can't see what any rational person sees in him. Oh yeah..... no rational person follows him I forgot! Bush 1& 2 aren't even voting for him or their own party. They're regrettably voting for Clinton. You'd think that would be a big clue. Seems notHow could a man with such an enormous ego and so few accomplishments, foul mouthed, intolerant and ignorant of the most basic world events even be on the ticket?
4 | David Geise | 29 | 10154732883243675_10154734346273675 | Republicans win when voter turnout is low. Hence their strategy of voter disenfranchisement (voter ID, reducing/eliminating early voting, eliminating weekend voting, opposition to making Election Day a national holiday).
5 | Vince White | 37 | 10154732883243675_10154734322533675 | Thank goodness a judge sees through this blatant attempt from the now soulless and corrupt Republican Party's attempts to disenfranchise minority voters.
6 | Vince White | 12 | 10154732883243675_10154734357688675 | The fact is that it will be up to minority voters to show up and demand their legal right to vote...and if these alt-right goons show up to intimidate voters then so should the Black Panthers!
7 | Peggy Schmid | 20 | 10154732883243675_10154734317723675 | And they must be allowed to vote in THIS election! Because the NAACP has already laid the groundwork when they took the case to the federal judge and won, to sue if Clinton loses by even one vote.Currently the Republicans are the ones who are rigging the system by trying to disenfranchise minority voters.

Trump also threw parties with underage girls and was known for his obsession with young girls.

Mark Shields and David Brooks lament this "campaign of hate" in their final Friday analysis before the election.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Liz Regenold | 90 | 10154733139413675_10154733307098675 | I'm begging, because I'm way past praying, that our country can return to some form of sanity. I'm a Hillary supporter, I'm terrified of what Trump will do if he wins. If he doesn't win, I'm terrified of what his supporters will do.  But I'm also aware that is how Trump supporters feel.  I'm generally not a jumpy paranoid person, but this election has got me on edge.  This whole thing just sucks.
2 | Mike Caldwell | 31 | 10154733139413675_10154733390553675 | I think David Brooks cut to the heart of the matter when he speaks to what has happened in this election with the white HS educated voter which once was the center of the Democratic voter. Worth a listen for sure.
3 | Karen Wieland | 43 | 10154733139413675_10154733295938675 | I agree with David Brooke's that America is more divided now than ever - but the issue we are most divided about is the degree to which bigotry can/should be tolerated. Trump's bigotry colors (pun intended) almost everything he says and almost every 'policy' he proposes (no real policies, just sound bites, of course, but let's put that aside for the moment). His bigotry is deep-seated - no one could fake being that hateful -- but it is also exacerbated by the bigotry of so many of his supporters. This is not a partisan comment, by the way. His entire campaign is fueled by white racial resentment. Well, our nation's demographics are changing and the era of white supremacy is, at long last, coming to an end. Why do I think that? Because this election season is bigotry's loudest and therefore last hurrah. A slim majority of American voters will recognize that the hateful mindsets encapsulated by Trump's campaign are simply unacceptable and  not who "We the people of these United States of America" want to be. We are #StrongerTogether. #LoveTrumpsHate #GrabThemByTheBallot #VoteBlue #ClintonKaine2016
4 | David Robbins Jr | 20 | 10154733139413675_10154733860113675 | This campaign wouldn't have been so negative but for the Trump candidacy. He's a hideous human being and throughout the primary did nothing but advance idiotic, ill-formed ideas while launching grotesque ad hominem attacks at nearly all opponents and half this doltish nation ate it up and forgave everything he did. And then he carried on into the general the same way
5 | Gina Molling | 13 | 10154733139413675_10154733959028675 | Trump's campaign started and ended with perhaps the most hate filled campaign in American history. I feel so sadden that he was elected by the Republican party. Hillary has put up a very good fight in fighting his bigotry and hate. We need to wake up and put a stop to Trump!
6 | Jody Michael Sanchez | 9 | 10154733139413675_10154733369443675 | HIS END OF THE BARGAIN.George Herbert Walker Bush (father), foretold, ‚ÄúRead my lips.‚Äù, as a motivator to acquire votes. Yet, his no new taxes was vacated because nobody was spending the money and he eventually raised taxes. Mr. Trump wants to cut taxes, when our government has no money. He wants to start up some programs, with what money? Latching on to President Reagans legacy Trump thinks a slogan is the key, "Make America Great Again." but there are no plans. No details why invest in something when you know your not going to do it. Mr. Trump thinks businesses will be spurred on by tax cuts to hire. Hire for what purpose? To make America Great again, but that was President Reagan‚Äôs eulogy. Many have tried to latch on to President Reagan‚Äôs dossier with shoddy success; with no focal point like the Soviet Union, Cold War, their is no objective. Trump looks to embrace the Soviet Union, and that reeks of collusion to espionage. The evidence lies in the circumstantial evidence.The business ventures of Trump offer relational characteristics that provide a picture of a man whose thought processes are without logic. Trump rather uses emotion to capture an audience. In Trump‚Äôs message, he appeals to emotions which makes it easy to empathize with the message he provides. Blaming Hillary Clinton is scapegoating. A childish prank to avoid blame or punishment. President Bill Clinton took our economy out of debt and three Bush Presidencies sunk us in debt. Now that my friend is where the tires meet the road and progress is made. Republicans have sat on their hands, like little nasty kids, and were paid for doing that. I recommend they be fired! FIRED! ‚Ä¶. FIRED! I like the way that sounds. Fire Republicans.Once Trump touches a nerve that stirs your emotions it‚Äôs easy to jump on board. Being mistreated and where you turn for help and are then being exploited, like Trump does, is a manipulation that has stolen billable hours of work and money from many companies. That reputation, those memories, are all I want to be known. I hope he follows through with his end of the bargain.
7 | David Crowell | 16 | 10154733139413675_10154733467378675 | It is a total false equivalence to blame the rancor on Hillary as much as the sexual predator bankruptcy expert. Trump is a seriously low, vindictive person, and the only reason he is competitive at all is that they lie through their teeth about Hillary and have been for 25 years. There is reason for the rancor. The Republicans have brought fascism & Putin to our doorstep.  That deserves to be shouted down. Republicans do not appear to care about actual governance to any degree. This must be stopped.
8 | Barbara Burgins Reekie | 8 | 10154733139413675_10154733527188675 | Not the same corruption! That's the illusion so many are touting. When and why have so many in this nation become so uniformed. Misinformation, outright lies. It's the 'reality show' mentality. It's not real! It's made up.
9 | Tamara Moscowitz | 3 | 10154733139413675_10154734007453675 | I was appalled that once again the FBI's renewed investigation into Hillary's emails were not discussed as a factor in the election. And, that former Mayor Giuliani admitted FBI leaked info to the Trump campaign. Brooks ad Shields repeated their usual mantra - Hillary is disliked, no one knows why she is running - never once mentioning her qualifications and that some people LIKE HER and are pleased she's in the game. The negativity of these two and lack of broadening their outlook is grounds for rethinking their presence. Mark Shields is awfully nice and strokes David Brooks (smug) whenever he can.  Can't the producers find some fresh views? And, it's not Amy Walter.
10 | Charles Kenneth Conner | 2 | 10154733139413675_10154734542923675 | Truly, I look forward to the weekly commentary of this two individuals (or their subs). However, this election has seen a tortured use of false equivalency as witnessed in this commentary by them on 11/4/2016. The tenor and tone of the past 18 months have been dictated by Trump's horrible message and the media's lack of historical context. If your battle cry is that the government isn't sufficiently racist and misogynistic, then you shouldn't be trying to make the government racist or misogynistic. It's in the Constitution that the government won't be those things. And we are self-governed. Just like Gore and Kerry before, the media have taken innuendo and dumbed-down propaganda and equated these items as "real" questions about Clinton's character. No one is saying that she is perfect and has never sinned; we are saying that what transgressions that can be attributed to her are nothing compared to the actual actions and statements that he has made. Not even close. To make points that there's always a "whiff" of impropriety with Clinton is a falsehood continued by these two gentlemen as compared to the stench from Trump. And why can't Brooks utter Trump's name as the person who is unfit to be President?
11 | John Boland | 0 | 10154733139413675_10154735753663675 | I wanted to believe that Brooks was misquoted when I saw press reports that he said last night that "less educated or high-school educated whites are going Trump . . . people are just going with their gene pool or whatever it is." Not a misquote; I listened to the tape. So bigoted talk about whites and their "gene pool" is now part of the PBS discussion. Wonder if David Brooks would have a job today if he had talked about "less educated" black voters and their "gene pool." So now bigotry is truly mainstreamed.
12 | Connie Atkinson | 0 | 10154733139413675_10154735824958675 | I hope that one thing comes out of this election - that more of us can see that we are all immersed in a culture of contest that harms every single person and every area of our lives. Partisan politics has become entrenched in this destructive contest. It has become more like a fanatical religion where you are not allowed to listen to anything outside your own ideological belief system lest you become "tainted" and tempted to change your own rigid beliefs or feel a shred of empathy for the "outsiders".
13 | Mary Williams | 2 | 10154733139413675_10154735119718675 | A little too late, guys!!! The media should have focused on the policies, not the antics of a master evil salesman. Instead, they gave him a $billion of free publicity. They broadcast his rallies on an almost daily basis; it was all "Trump said this!" And "Trump said that!"The American public doesn't really know much about him because he refuses to release his tax, debt, and other financial records.  He's a fraud.
14 | Brenda Wes Crawford | 0 | 10154733139413675_10154735513808675 | I wish I could believe that voting for Trump would end all abortion. But for 43 years the Republican Party has promised repeatedly  to pass bills, change Judges and yet they do nothing except use the death of unborn children as a platform to get the evangelical vote. I was a strong republican until I prayed so hard that I sobbed unable to breath. That is when I felt the Lord telling me that we will never stop the killing of babies as long as His people do not repent of their own sins. The sins of this nation are not the result of who is or who is not elected they are the result of a unclean church. A truly repented church will bring revival and revival will bring change.  2 chronicles 7:14

How much bed-wetting is going on among the establishment? Blame it on Comey if you must, but Hillary is flaming out like we've rarely seen a candidate flame out in our lifetime. And they all know it. That's why they're all so bummed out. Poor, poor pitiful libtard media types!

17 | Steven Wiley | 1 | 10154733139413675_10154733684323675 | Most Americans are tired of the promises not being kept by the Democrats and Republicans, tired of a two party system that serves the one percent, the uber-rich globalists and the corporate elites, tired of changes in the nation‚Äôs culture and moral standards, tired of being given half-truths and lies when honesty still remains the best policy and tired of sensing that the country is being changed ‚Äì not for the better - but for the betterment of an arrogant well-entrenched few.Trump supporters ‚ÄúHave Had It" with an array of establishment politicians and policies. They are rebelling against anyone named Bush or Clinton, rebelling against a two party lawless government, unconstitutional programs or politicians who have constantly trampled on the constitution, globalism and multinational trade deals that are so unfair to America that no small business can compete against them‚Ä¶ They are rebelling against political correctness, a senseless radical migration agenda, an out-of-control illegal immigration policy, Obamacare or the Un-Affordable Care Act, federal reserve money-printing schemes, global warming nonsense, gun confiscation threats, stagnant wages, boys in the girls bathrooms, historic unemployment, an escalating terrorist threat, rampant political corruption that destroys all hope of the American Dream and - so ‚Äì much - more.!.

Beyond Trump‚Äôs inane bluster, his supporters‚Äô rudeness, his groping, his lies, and claims of rigging, et al, his two real policy promises (tax cuts for the rich and $Bs more on military equipment) would do nothing to address the demands of the mobs standing at his rallies, shouting "build a wall" or "jail her" or "kill Jews.‚Äù If the authoritarian Trump wins, there'll be a lot more angry, disappointed people whose faux concerns about 2ndA rights may be salved, but their plates still empty, their coal mines closed and their health further in jeopardy - and the world less safe, and ice caps melting and oceans drowning Miami.

23 | Gerald Ott | 0 | 10154733139413675_10154734407548675 | Today, 18th century journalist Elijah Lovejoy is known as a martyr of free speech. But his greatest legacy is not that he dared speak, but what he dared to say. The press has no true power if it is afraid to document attacks on the most vulnerable citizens, and to challenge those who abet such attacks. Today, journalists cope with multiple fears: fear of maintaining employment in a terrible economy; fear of losing access to powerful elites through criticism; and fear of the mob, a fear openly expressed by writers who are targeted by Trump fans. While journalists who cover Clinton also face criticism and are sometimes mocked by her supporters, they are not subjected to the type of racist threats that Trump fans make; nor does Clinton encourage her fans to engage in this behavior. https://thecorrespondent.com/5575/our-fate-was-sealed-long-before-november-8-and-not-because-the-elections-rigged/1576889402275-7591b019

8 | Scottas Sevelis | 0 | 10154733123598675_10154733575318675 | A Short List of Some of Hillary‚Äôs Many Crimes!!!Here are a few of Hillary‚Äôs crimes. Feel free to share.1. Perjury: Why not start with a blast from the Clinton past? Hillary Clinton signed documents testifying that she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department, on orders from a federal judge, under penalty of perjury. We already have indisputable proof she violated this sworn statement‚Ä¶ thousands of times. The cloud of false statements under oath surrounding Hillary Clinton is thousands of times thicker than the one around Bill. Democrats seem to have found a hidden clause in the Constitution that says Clintons can never be prosecuted for perjury, but Madame Secretary is really stress-testing that particular privilege of Clintonhood. One would think the federal judiciary had some interest in establishing that sworn documents must be taken seriously. 2. Obstruction of Justice: Bill Clinton‚Äôs primary motive for committing perjury was to obstruct justice‚Äîit was the second count in his impeachment. (The justice he was obstructing was a sexual harassment suit from Paula Jones, at a time when liberals insisted sexual harassment was the most overlooked, under-prosecuted crime in the legal code.) Hillary‚Äôs thousands of perjury counts are also related to the obstruction of justice. She held back documents she didn‚Äôt want Congress to see. She subverted the Freedom of Information Act, which is a law, not a lovely suggestion. Most media timelines of the Clinton email scandal are either incomplete or deliberately obtuse, because they almost never accurately relate how her secret server was discovered. For example, these timelines from USA Today, CNN, and ABC News all get it wrong. Sharyl Attkisson, who was a participant in the story, has an accurate timeline that makes the important point Clinton-friendly media outlets don‚Äôt want to talk about: we know about the secret server because the State Department was sued for failing to respond to FOIA requests. The State Department‚Äôs official story is that they were surprised to discover Clinton was withholding thousands of documents on her private computer. That‚Äôs straight-up obstruction of justice, in cases involving multiple federal courts, as surely as Bill Clinton‚Äôs impeachable offense of obstructing the Paula Jones suit. Clinton may become untouchable if the American people allow her into the White House, but the lawsuits don‚Äôt evaporate, and neither do the angry judges. 3. Bribery: After the FBI set off a headline earthquake by re-opening the Clinton email investigation, we learned that several other FBI investigations of Clintonworld have been quietly in progress for some time. One of those investigations is digging into bribery allegations against the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents working on these cases were reportedly very angry that top Bureau and Justice Department officials were pressuring them to drop their investigations. The most attention-grabbing of these suspicions concerns an FBI official, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife received an inexplicably huge political donation from Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe, currently the governor of Virginia. The timing of this donation was so convenient that even the Left side of the blogosphere has produced some uneasy speculation that McCabe probably should have recused himself from all things Clinton-related. Well, he didn‚Äôt recuse himself, and the conflicts of interest are so apparent that the lack of a chiseled-in-stone quid pro quo might not be enough to kill this case off. After all, corrupt officials aren‚Äôt usually dumb enough to write down their quid pro quo agreements, or repeat them into microphones. The McCabe controversy already has longer legs than most observers expected, when the news first broke. 4. Pay for Play: There has also been recent confirmation that the FBI has investigated influence-peddling allegations against the Clinton Foundation, which was so obviously used for that purpose that it‚Äôs funny to watch Clinton apologists insist nothing can be proven in a court of law. Some of the most vigorous infighting within the Bureau reportedly concerns whether pay-for-play investigations should move forward. WikiLeaks has exposed emails from Clinton insiders that openly discuss how the Foundation was part of a network that steered millions of dollars to ‚ÄúBill Clinton Inc.‚Äù Even longtime members of the Clinton syndicate professed themselves troubled by these operations. They were also unhappy with arrangements like Hillary Clinton‚Äôs agreement to speak in Morocco after a $12 million donation to the Clinton Global Initiative. It‚Äôs entirely possible that more documentation about these suspicious Clinton Foundation dealings will come to light after the election, especially if some of the people Clinton took money from grow upset with her. It‚Äôs downright dangerous to have a President with so many strings attached. 5. Illegal Use of a Nonprofit Organization: There are many laws governing the management of charitable organizations, generally intended to prevent them from becoming money-laundering operations, ripoff operations, and vehicles for political influence peddling. The Clinton Foundation and its galaxy of related operations may eventually find itself answering some questions about compliance with those laws, assuming the IRS decides to stop focusing its efforts on hassling mom-and-pop pro-life groups and kitchen-table Tea Party outfits. If the Foundation is ever held to account for any other impropriety, charges of abusing a nonprofit should be part of the legal package as well. 6. Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a ‚Äúracketeering enterprise,‚Äù which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained: Under RICO, an ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate ‚Äì it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through ‚Äúa pattern of racketeering activity.‚Äù A ‚Äúpattern‚Äù means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute ‚Äúracketeering activity‚Äù if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute.7. Fraud: Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel has been building a case that the ‚ÄúClinton Charity Network,‚Äù as he calls the complete system of Clinton operations, has committed ‚Äúcharity fraud of epic proportions.‚Äù In part, he refers to discrepancies between donor accounts and the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs books. Others have pointed out how the Clinton Health Access Initiative has essentially ignored New York state law for years, without a peep from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (who just happens to be part of the Clinton campaign‚Äôs ‚Äúleadership council.‚Äù) There are some interesting differences between the paperwork CHAI submitted to the IRS and what it submitted to the state of New York, which has more specific requirements about identifying foreign donors. In addition to getting a free pass on perjury, the Clintons are traditionally allowed to violate tax laws without penalty, eventually refiling paperwork when ‚Äúerrors‚Äù are discovered years after the fact. Another round of whoops-my-bad, no-harm-no-foul ‚Äúrefiling‚Äù during a Hillary Clinton presidency would be embarrassing, especially if she‚Äôs busy trying to ratchet up taxes on everyone else.

Perhaps Hillary is not as good at campaigning.  Trump is an entertainer; he can rally up a crowd.  But his professional life is littered with lawsuits, bankruptcies, and unpaid bills.  Not a single colleague or business associate spoke on his behalf at the convention.  Since he won‚Äôt reveal his tax returns, we don‚Äôt even know if he‚Äôs a good businessman; we do know that he feels no obligation to pay his fair share. There‚Äôs no evidence he‚Äôs ever done anything good for anyone except himself." - Jan Uhrbach

5 | Karen Morris | 2 | 10154733133233675_10154734686618675 | So much of "healthcare" in this country is linked to and defined by the insurance industry.

Where are the candidates spending the campaign's final days?

1 | Michele A Wilcox | 23 | 10154733118328675_10154733163178675 | The truth remains that words do matter, especially when it comes to presidential candidates. On that basis alone, Donald Trump is not qualified to be president of the United States.Don't let America become another one of Trump's failed enterprises.
2 | David Hathaway | 4 | 10154733118328675_10154733563703675 | U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders has been speaking out against price gouging practices of certain pharmaceutical companies, causing their share prices to take big hits.Bernie has gained substantial influence thanks to his run for the Democratic nominee bid, but his impact will be greatly diminished if HRC does not win the presidency. A vote for HRC is a vote for more from Bernie as well.
3 | Richard Gougeon | 2 | 10154733118328675_10154733238568675 | She may be Hillary Clinton‚Äôs niece, but she‚Äôs definitely not with her. 25-year-old Macy Smit, daughter of Bill Clinton‚Äôs half-brother Roger, said that she finds her aunt ‚Äúselfish‚Äù and declared that she is proudly on the Trump train. Trump is what we need right now ‚Äî somebody who is going to stand up for us. I think at this point Hillary just wants it for the history books ‚Äî to be the first woman president for selfish reasons,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúThe Clintons are all talk!‚Äù  ‚ÄúHillary says she‚Äôs all about family, but she‚Äôs got a niece she‚Äôs never met and never acknowledged. The Clintons have never helped us out.‚Äù She said. ‚ÄúSomething tells me the Clinton side looks at me and my mother as not good enough, but we‚Äôre hard-working,‚Äù Smit said.

5 | Tim Loeb | 2 | 10154733118328675_10154733691173675 | Take a stand against Trump. Trump promotes hate, stand for love. Trump promotes fear, stand for courage. Trump promotes division, stand for unity. Trump supports despair, stand for hope. You will not be standing alone......we are millions..... pass the message on.
6 | Sandor Feher | 1 | 10154733118328675_10154733165728675 | Its the first Planetary Election for the whole Planet! W-Bush has successfully managed not to ever compromise for a two-party favor: his legacy is an extremely polarized, internally-weakened US zeitgeist, that placed the border-treaties to jeopardy- landing a World Hegemony for the wrong-side of history. If Adolf Trump and his erratic-psychopatology elected, all Iron-Curtain will be allocated to the totalitarian absolutist, Putin including the Scandinavian booty. Sino-Russia is free to neo-colonize at ease..The Middle-East is an indefinite Buffer-Zone, Singapore lands to Xi's new Empire, so on...
7 | Danny Sirko | 1 | 10154733118328675_10154733184303675 | The future of the United States approaches a dangerous precipice. The Bush- Obama-Clinton personal agendas merge into a present day secular humanism and a leftist socialist democracy.Trump is indeed a sinner as are all. No one elected can claim otherwise. The Hand of God who brings all the candidates into the battle must posture and equip each with the skills to challenge effectively. You cannot send to meet the Clinton's  secular humanism and political machine organized upon the principles of force, greed, selfishness, ambition, and sinful pleasure any less than one their equal in the political cesspool of politics; to attempt a swing back to center from progression left. So I say...pray to your god(s) or lack thereof.Loudly ! For I shall do the same in this CIVIL COLD WAR. And may the will of the Judeo-Christian God; Jesus Christ the Lord and Saviour,who you continually attempt to relegate to a position of obscurity  and irrelevancy prevail !This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.Daniel 4:17Bush, Kasich, Cruz,and all Republicans should rally to their party and the God- ordained and selected presidential candidate. He is not perfect, they are not perfect, the party is not perfect but the Obama-Clinton machine is powerful and  extremely dangerous. You are not guiltless if it succeeds !What RADICAL LEFT-WING LIBERAL PROGRESSIVISM, SECULAR HUMANISM AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM doesn't have...

21 | Scottas Sevelis | 0 | 10154733118328675_10154733578533675 | A Short List of Some of Hillary‚Äôs Many Crimes!!!Here are a few of Hillary‚Äôs crimes. Feel free to share.1. Perjury: Why not start with a blast from the Clinton past? Hillary Clinton signed documents testifying that she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department, on orders from a federal judge, under penalty of perjury. We already have indisputable proof she violated this sworn statement‚Ä¶ thousands of times. The cloud of false statements under oath surrounding Hillary Clinton is thousands of times thicker than the one around Bill. Democrats seem to have found a hidden clause in the Constitution that says Clintons can never be prosecuted for perjury, but Madame Secretary is really stress-testing that particular privilege of Clintonhood. One would think the federal judiciary had some interest in establishing that sworn documents must be taken seriously. 2. Obstruction of Justice: Bill Clinton‚Äôs primary motive for committing perjury was to obstruct justice‚Äîit was the second count in his impeachment. (The justice he was obstructing was a sexual harassment suit from Paula Jones, at a time when liberals insisted sexual harassment was the most overlooked, under-prosecuted crime in the legal code.) Hillary‚Äôs thousands of perjury counts are also related to the obstruction of justice. She held back documents she didn‚Äôt want Congress to see. She subverted the Freedom of Information Act, which is a law, not a lovely suggestion. Most media timelines of the Clinton email scandal are either incomplete or deliberately obtuse, because they almost never accurately relate how her secret server was discovered. For example, these timelines from USA Today, CNN, and ABC News all get it wrong. Sharyl Attkisson, who was a participant in the story, has an accurate timeline that makes the important point Clinton-friendly media outlets don‚Äôt want to talk about: we know about the secret server because the State Department was sued for failing to respond to FOIA requests. The State Department‚Äôs official story is that they were surprised to discover Clinton was withholding thousands of documents on her private computer. That‚Äôs straight-up obstruction of justice, in cases involving multiple federal courts, as surely as Bill Clinton‚Äôs impeachable offense of obstructing the Paula Jones suit. Clinton may become untouchable if the American people allow her into the White House, but the lawsuits don‚Äôt evaporate, and neither do the angry judges. 3. Bribery: After the FBI set off a headline earthquake by re-opening the Clinton email investigation, we learned that several other FBI investigations of Clintonworld have been quietly in progress for some time. One of those investigations is digging into bribery allegations against the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents working on these cases were reportedly very angry that top Bureau and Justice Department officials were pressuring them to drop their investigations. The most attention-grabbing of these suspicions concerns an FBI official, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife received an inexplicably huge political donation from Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe, currently the governor of Virginia. The timing of this donation was so convenient that even the Left side of the blogosphere has produced some uneasy speculation that McCabe probably should have recused himself from all things Clinton-related. Well, he didn‚Äôt recuse himself, and the conflicts of interest are so apparent that the lack of a chiseled-in-stone quid pro quo might not be enough to kill this case off. After all, corrupt officials aren‚Äôt usually dumb enough to write down their quid pro quo agreements, or repeat them into microphones. The McCabe controversy already has longer legs than most observers expected, when the news first broke. 4. Pay for Play: There has also been recent confirmation that the FBI has investigated influence-peddling allegations against the Clinton Foundation, which was so obviously used for that purpose that it‚Äôs funny to watch Clinton apologists insist nothing can be proven in a court of law. Some of the most vigorous infighting within the Bureau reportedly concerns whether pay-for-play investigations should move forward. WikiLeaks has exposed emails from Clinton insiders that openly discuss how the Foundation was part of a network that steered millions of dollars to ‚ÄúBill Clinton Inc.‚Äù Even longtime members of the Clinton syndicate professed themselves troubled by these operations. They were also unhappy with arrangements like Hillary Clinton‚Äôs agreement to speak in Morocco after a $12 million donation to the Clinton Global Initiative. It‚Äôs entirely possible that more documentation about these suspicious Clinton Foundation dealings will come to light after the election, especially if some of the people Clinton took money from grow upset with her. It‚Äôs downright dangerous to have a President with so many strings attached. 5. Illegal Use of a Nonprofit Organization: There are many laws governing the management of charitable organizations, generally intended to prevent them from becoming money-laundering operations, ripoff operations, and vehicles for political influence peddling. The Clinton Foundation and its galaxy of related operations may eventually find itself answering some questions about compliance with those laws, assuming the IRS decides to stop focusing its efforts on hassling mom-and-pop pro-life groups and kitchen-table Tea Party outfits. If the Foundation is ever held to account for any other impropriety, charges of abusing a nonprofit should be part of the legal package as well. 6. Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a ‚Äúracketeering enterprise,‚Äù which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained: Under RICO, an ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate ‚Äì it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through ‚Äúa pattern of racketeering activity.‚Äù A ‚Äúpattern‚Äù means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute ‚Äúracketeering activity‚Äù if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute.7. Fraud: Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel has been building a case that the ‚ÄúClinton Charity Network,‚Äù as he calls the complete system of Clinton operations, has committed ‚Äúcharity fraud of epic proportions.‚Äù In part, he refers to discrepancies between donor accounts and the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs books. Others have pointed out how the Clinton Health Access Initiative has essentially ignored New York state law for years, without a peep from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (who just happens to be part of the Clinton campaign‚Äôs ‚Äúleadership council.‚Äù) There are some interesting differences between the paperwork CHAI submitted to the IRS and what it submitted to the state of New York, which has more specific requirements about identifying foreign donors. In addition to getting a free pass on perjury, the Clintons are traditionally allowed to violate tax laws without penalty, eventually refiling paperwork when ‚Äúerrors‚Äù are discovered years after the fact. Another round of whoops-my-bad, no-harm-no-foul ‚Äúrefiling‚Äù during a Hillary Clinton presidency would be embarrassing, especially if she‚Äôs busy trying to ratchet up taxes on everyone else.

The red color coded team are for those that feel and have beliefs and the blue color coded team are told they are thinkers, lol,.so with that well aimed for 50, 50 divide it is not hard for those corp oligarchs to control gov by shifting a small percent on either side to claim majority support

His entertainment and enlightenment news value was next to nothing, if not completely dispersed to zero to Jon Stewart! CNN kept Begala on as a contributor, what has been his contribution this Election? His broadening of fanaticism taken from out of context excerpts on Trump. By fashioning a model of him, scaled up by his own shallow minded ignorances of Trump someone he doesn't know! And only to falsely propagate political sensitivities in the masses subjectively just conjecture! Other words, it's a Super-pac crap shoot of Ads. Does Paul Begala think America is that shallow minded like him, that they are going to lose a Movement? A Momentum to their Voice to Shatter the Establishment of Washington with all its shortfalls leaving the Americans that empowered them to be left behind? America is not trading that for your perjurious lying Ads, NEVER! View below:It also worked out for me. CNN canceled "Crossfire" but has kept me on as a contributor, a role that I prefer. It gives me far more freedom than "Crossfire" did. Rather than always narrowly toeing the party line, I am more free to criticize my people, for example, when President Barack Obama failed to go to the Mexican border to see the child immigration crisis firsthand.I have not spoken to Jon Stewart since that day. I ran into him in a hotel lobby once, and he darted away like he'd seen a ghost. When I had a book I wanted to plug on his show, he wouldn't take my call!America is Great Again Now Paul Begala!

13 | Scottas Sevelis | 1 | 10154732881233675_10154733578848675 | A Short List of Some of Hillary‚Äôs Many Crimes!!!Here are a few of Hillary‚Äôs crimes. Feel free to share.1. Perjury: Why not start with a blast from the Clinton past? Hillary Clinton signed documents testifying that she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department, on orders from a federal judge, under penalty of perjury. We already have indisputable proof she violated this sworn statement‚Ä¶ thousands of times. The cloud of false statements under oath surrounding Hillary Clinton is thousands of times thicker than the one around Bill. Democrats seem to have found a hidden clause in the Constitution that says Clintons can never be prosecuted for perjury, but Madame Secretary is really stress-testing that particular privilege of Clintonhood. One would think the federal judiciary had some interest in establishing that sworn documents must be taken seriously. 2. Obstruction of Justice: Bill Clinton‚Äôs primary motive for committing perjury was to obstruct justice‚Äîit was the second count in his impeachment. (The justice he was obstructing was a sexual harassment suit from Paula Jones, at a time when liberals insisted sexual harassment was the most overlooked, under-prosecuted crime in the legal code.) Hillary‚Äôs thousands of perjury counts are also related to the obstruction of justice. She held back documents she didn‚Äôt want Congress to see. She subverted the Freedom of Information Act, which is a law, not a lovely suggestion. Most media timelines of the Clinton email scandal are either incomplete or deliberately obtuse, because they almost never accurately relate how her secret server was discovered. For example, these timelines from USA Today, CNN, and ABC News all get it wrong. Sharyl Attkisson, who was a participant in the story, has an accurate timeline that makes the important point Clinton-friendly media outlets don‚Äôt want to talk about: we know about the secret server because the State Department was sued for failing to respond to FOIA requests. The State Department‚Äôs official story is that they were surprised to discover Clinton was withholding thousands of documents on her private computer. That‚Äôs straight-up obstruction of justice, in cases involving multiple federal courts, as surely as Bill Clinton‚Äôs impeachable offense of obstructing the Paula Jones suit. Clinton may become untouchable if the American people allow her into the White House, but the lawsuits don‚Äôt evaporate, and neither do the angry judges. 3. Bribery: After the FBI set off a headline earthquake by re-opening the Clinton email investigation, we learned that several other FBI investigations of Clintonworld have been quietly in progress for some time. One of those investigations is digging into bribery allegations against the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents working on these cases were reportedly very angry that top Bureau and Justice Department officials were pressuring them to drop their investigations. The most attention-grabbing of these suspicions concerns an FBI official, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife received an inexplicably huge political donation from Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe, currently the governor of Virginia. The timing of this donation was so convenient that even the Left side of the blogosphere has produced some uneasy speculation that McCabe probably should have recused himself from all things Clinton-related. Well, he didn‚Äôt recuse himself, and the conflicts of interest are so apparent that the lack of a chiseled-in-stone quid pro quo might not be enough to kill this case off. After all, corrupt officials aren‚Äôt usually dumb enough to write down their quid pro quo agreements, or repeat them into microphones. The McCabe controversy already has longer legs than most observers expected, when the news first broke. 4. Pay for Play: There has also been recent confirmation that the FBI has investigated influence-peddling allegations against the Clinton Foundation, which was so obviously used for that purpose that it‚Äôs funny to watch Clinton apologists insist nothing can be proven in a court of law. Some of the most vigorous infighting within the Bureau reportedly concerns whether pay-for-play investigations should move forward. WikiLeaks has exposed emails from Clinton insiders that openly discuss how the Foundation was part of a network that steered millions of dollars to ‚ÄúBill Clinton Inc.‚Äù Even longtime members of the Clinton syndicate professed themselves troubled by these operations. They were also unhappy with arrangements like Hillary Clinton‚Äôs agreement to speak in Morocco after a $12 million donation to the Clinton Global Initiative. It‚Äôs entirely possible that more documentation about these suspicious Clinton Foundation dealings will come to light after the election, especially if some of the people Clinton took money from grow upset with her. It‚Äôs downright dangerous to have a President with so many strings attached. 5. Illegal Use of a Nonprofit Organization: There are many laws governing the management of charitable organizations, generally intended to prevent them from becoming money-laundering operations, ripoff operations, and vehicles for political influence peddling. The Clinton Foundation and its galaxy of related operations may eventually find itself answering some questions about compliance with those laws, assuming the IRS decides to stop focusing its efforts on hassling mom-and-pop pro-life groups and kitchen-table Tea Party outfits. If the Foundation is ever held to account for any other impropriety, charges of abusing a nonprofit should be part of the legal package as well. 6. Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a ‚Äúracketeering enterprise,‚Äù which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained: Under RICO, an ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate ‚Äì it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through ‚Äúa pattern of racketeering activity.‚Äù A ‚Äúpattern‚Äù means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute ‚Äúracketeering activity‚Äù if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute.7. Fraud: Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel has been building a case that the ‚ÄúClinton Charity Network,‚Äù as he calls the complete system of Clinton operations, has committed ‚Äúcharity fraud of epic proportions.‚Äù In part, he refers to discrepancies between donor accounts and the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs books. Others have pointed out how the Clinton Health Access Initiative has essentially ignored New York state law for years, without a peep from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (who just happens to be part of the Clinton campaign‚Äôs ‚Äúleadership council.‚Äù) There are some interesting differences between the paperwork CHAI submitted to the IRS and what it submitted to the state of New York, which has more specific requirements about identifying foreign donors. In addition to getting a free pass on perjury, the Clintons are traditionally allowed to violate tax laws without penalty, eventually refiling paperwork when ‚Äúerrors‚Äù are discovered years after the fact. Another round of whoops-my-bad, no-harm-no-foul ‚Äúrefiling‚Äù during a Hillary Clinton presidency would be embarrassing, especially if she‚Äôs busy trying to ratchet up taxes on everyone else.

Invest your vote.  A vote for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka and the Green Party is a vote for a viable progressive party in a multi-party democracy going forward."Just 5 percent of the national vote for the Green Party Stein/Baraka ticket can be a true game-changer for American politics. It will qualify the Green Party for recognition as an official national party, and for federal funding in the 2020 presidential race proportional to the amount of votes received ‚Äî at least $8 million to $10 million. It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state). It means the party can leap over the undemocratic barriers to ballot access for independent parties in many states, and help us lay the groundwork for a truly competitive challenge to the two-party system and the corporate rule it perpetuates." A majority of Americans are disgusted with the political farce we are enduring. They are desperate for a principled alternative to the predatory bipartisan establishment, and seek a positive path out of the two-party trap. Investing your vote in a 5-percent victory for the Green Party can make it happen.‚Äù -- Jill Steinhttp://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/27/why-5-for-the-green-party-is-a-win-for-america-jill-stein-commentary.html
