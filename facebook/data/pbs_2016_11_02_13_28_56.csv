The Food and Drug Administration is asking the public to reflect on an important health question: How much Nutella do you actually eat? (from STAT)
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sharon Carroll Allen | 0 | 10154725743783675_10154725867188675 | I tried it once, with a dairy supplement, as I am lactose intolerant. I didn't enjoy the flavor of Nutella, so I haven't used it again. It seemed like a strange alternative to peanut butter spread, for those who can't have peanuts--the added cocoa makes it more of a dessert topping. Just my opinion.
2 | Diane Olson | 2 | 10154725743783675_10154725914023675 | None, and have never tasted it. I control my diabetes by diet and I'm very successful at it. This, to me, is just more fake food. Even on my cheat day, this would not be a consideration. My peanut butter and almond butter are simply crushed nuts, with a bit of salt. If you look at the ingredients list for the national brands, YUK.
3 | Juanita Nunez-Archuleta | 3 | 10154725743783675_10154725906073675 | Nutella on a slice of lightly toasted brioche or French bread topped with fresh strawberries and sugar. Then using a kitchen creme Brule torch warming until sugar makes a nice shiny caramel mixed with the juice of the berries....yummmmm#fuckthefdaanyway
4 | Karen Hubert | 2 | 10154725743783675_10154725903263675 | Don't be fool hearty this is a chocolate spread that should be eaten in moderation. We are already an overweight nation. Always after the money. So tired of companies trying to trick the consumer.
5 | JenniferBond GerardoPortillo | 1 | 10154725743783675_10154725848633675 | 2 T is what I would say we use. For my kids, I lightly toast bead, Nutella, sliced bananas. 2- sparingly spread in mini croissants with sliced bananas 3- put in small Tupperware with a baggy of graham crackers in their lunch box
6 | Bidisha Mukherjee Riccardi | 0 | 10154725743783675_10154725980638675 | Umm, a lot. One or two good size spoonfuls at a time. I don't have it on toast, but it's great as a drizzle on an acai bowl or on a rice cake with fruit on top. For both it's about two teaspoons or so.
7 | Victor Acevedo | 5 | 10154725743783675_10154725831533675 | I think 2 is a pretty good estimate. I had several flashbacks of me putting one tbs on toast and a second directly in my mouth
8 | Vickie Jordan | 1 | 10154725743783675_10154725948443675 | The stuff is garbage! Chemical flavored palm oil. They make it out to be a health food but read the label.  Yuck!
9 | Joan Brown | 2 | 10154725743783675_10154725894808675 | You should eat NONE, as it contains palm oil , the production of which contributes to the deforestation and loss of habitat for so many endangered species on the continent of Indonesia!!  Just say NO .
10 | Jennifer Jones | 3 | 10154725743783675_10154725859938675 | I think it's the same as putting Hershey's chocolate syrup on your toast, but double the calories. Delicious but obviously not exactly a health food :)

18 | Carol Wood | 1 | 10154725743783675_10154725824293675 | I would have trouble stopping at 2 T which is why I don't buy or eat it.
19 | Kristi Holden | 0 | 10154725743783675_10154725909423675 | None at all.  It has palm oil in it and that is a no-no for my diet.

General Motors, for instance, now employs barely a third of the 600,000 workers it had in the 1970s. Yet it churns out more cars and trucks than ever.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | William H Boley | 32 | 10154725620278675_10154725718678675 | So, the loss of jobs is based not as much on globalization as on technology changes? It might be both/and, rather than either/or, but this is an interesting perspective, and one that was missed completely in the debates and discussions in the current election campaign.
2 | Arvis Wright | 4 | 10154725620278675_10154725761593675 | Irony: I loved transcribing spoken words on a dictaphone machine into written words to share with others - and many did this as their profession in clerical support. Try and find a job transcribing when so many of the executive staff carry their own laptop/devices. This moment in time (automation?) has been voiced for a few decades - now it steps closer to becoming a reality. Folks refuse to see the writing on the wall - unemployment in human involvement with 'making things work' - Reality vs refusal to accept what IS.
3 | Pattie Mcmillin | 5 | 10154725620278675_10154725804513675 | It is called"progress". And with each technological advance, comes unemployment. States so affected, with federal assistance, should help in the education and retraining process, into the new fields opening up because of this change.
4 | S Lee Saliga | 5 | 10154725620278675_10154725798433675 | workers must update and retrain for this huge trasition from the industrial era to the technical era; there is help available. Trump builds up anger and scare propaganda just to get these workers' votes to see him as their saviour.....think reality people
5 | Brian Petersen | 12 | 10154725620278675_10154725741033675 | Massive factory jobs are never coming back to us, just look at what global companies are preparing for involving artificial intelligence and you realize  all the rhetoric in todays politics are out of touch with reality.
6 | Chris Koester | 4 | 10154725620278675_10154725856103675 | The days of graduating from high school and getting a good job down at the plant are over. Those jobs are not coming back. Over the coming years, more and more jobs will be eliminated do to technology.
7 | Kenneth J. Kaiser | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725954748675 | Yes, blame robots and the computers that operate them, as well as globalization. I'm 70 and when I was a kid the rule was never buy a new car made on a Monday because the guys making it were hungover from the weekend. So, far more and far better cars are made with far fewer people than was the case sixty years ago. That's just reality and there is simply no going back to an idealized past.
8 | Lorell Rademacher | 1 | 10154725620278675_10154725776663675 | So wait, wasn't there a story not so long ago about automation and how instead of taking jobs, it would actually create jobs? Well, maybe that was a comment feed discussion. I believe the topic was about minimum wage increases and fast food going to automation vs. paid employee. Either way...which is it? I think it's both quite frankly. Obama wants a push for middle management (mandatory college) executive based jobs because we are steering towards a less industrial nation but yet many of our citizens are neither qualified for white collar work, nor are they interested in those types of jobs. More of our industry opting for the lower tax penalties and lowered cost of doing business in other countries. Coupled with the strange, inate need of Americans to consume and collect products (which still feeds the need to produce them) it's a big win for the companies...but a big loss for America.
9 | Gail Dardenne Cole | 2 | 10154725620278675_10154725814123675 | I often talk about this. So many want to blame the jobs shipped out (which are very wrong and need to stop) for our job lose. But I can tell you that tech takes far more jobs or potential jobs. Most of what I do is automating things that a person can do. My worst experience was automating a report that was someones full time job. We had a meeting to show the report create itself in seconds. The woman cried, they forgot to tell he that they had another position for her.
10 | Mason Olson | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725924688675 | The remaining workers wage doesn't increase on the same or even similar trajectory as the increase in profits for the higher ups aka management or redundant Vice Presidents or the increase in production. At some point people may finally realize that corporations are using and disposing us like an office pen. Tricking and trolling everyone to fight each other. "That loser is on food stamp!"   "These freeloaders want 15 bucks an hour" "well then that would be socialism, they are communists". Wake up merica
11 | Tyler Hopping | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725897263675 | Automation is not the cause, but the symptom of minimum wages. If you have to choose between hiring someone to turn a wrench for $15 an hour and leasing a robot to do the same work for $10, which will you choose? There is undoubtedly someone willing to turn that wrench for $9/hr, but if the law forbids it, he is out of a job. This is the same reason that when you walk into a grocery store, the self-check-out line is always open, and the other registers are empty.
12 | Edward Laitila | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725772913675 | It is just simple economics when the price of labor is higher than a robot they install robots. Robots do not require benefits, and all the extra taxes associated with hiring a human so there is significant cost savings beyond wages (these cost can be higher than the wage). Happening in fast food industry since they are forced to pay higher wages with increased minimum wage.
13 | Kari Orr | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725711858675 | So you're saying that they could ramp their workforce back to the 70's level and make 3x the cars? Possibly they could find economies of scale to sell three times what they sell now? Why is the answer always cut workers as opposed to sell more cars, or sell cars with better profit margins?
14 | Jacquie McColl | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725969848675 | I remember when GM workers whined there jobs were to hard or too boring. Well higher powers listened didn't they. Bye bye jobs for people. Robots win you lose. Most of the workers back then had only a high school education and had not done any other job. Made great money too
15 | Phillip Day | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725951108675 | This is well known by many, except those on the right who believe their MFG jobs Trump can bring back. Not economically possible for businesses to do that, unless they want to go out of business, no one ever claimed the Republicans were savvy at business, or economics.
16 | Robert Rex Jackson | 1 | 10154725620278675_10154725806463675 | Yeah, keep spreading that false narrative. Reagan's, 'North American Union' plan to move our largest industry across the Ambassador Bridge to Canada was called, 'NAFTA' by the time Clinton signed it. The auto industry is still there. They have plenty of robots, but plenty of workers, as well. All covered by Canadian universal health care. Which saved our automobile industry a fortune, even though it murdered Detroit in the process.So yeah, keep repeating the propaganda of our oligarchs, but we don't have any entirely robotic manufacturing facilities. We've just moved all the jobs to places where it's less expensive to staff up.
17 | Judi Romaine | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725806503675 | It's life. Things move on all the time. And we humans think it should not be that way. Well, we thank it should not Be that way about half of life; our human beingness is designed that way. So far.
18 | Rona Hampton | 2 | 10154725620278675_10154725791703675 | Toured a major brewery. 10 humans worked there. When you go to a store and you choose self check out, remember that used to be someone's job.
19 | Bill DeHoff | 1 | 10154725620278675_10154725791843675 | This is an old, old story. As soon as technology can make production of all kinds cheaper and more efficient, people lose their livelihoods. Typewriters spelled the end of so many office clerk positions. Combustion engines wiped out almost everything related to horses from breeding farms to crop farming to delivery to warfare. Power looms ended the cottage industries of spinners and weavers. Moving jobs to lower cost regions, as New England textile mills moved to places like South Caroline, moved to places like Cambodia, moved to....But ultimately as the article states, robots will replace people as soon as robots are economically more efficient and cheaper. Attacking the cheaper labor of the moment is not going to provide any long term answers.
20 | Jo Schuster | 2 | 10154725620278675_10154725704393675 | Oh please.. if it was robots behind the reason they would build them here so they didn't have to pay transportation fees on everything to be shipped. The united states believe it or not also has a better educated public than Mexico as well..Blame bad trade deals. NaftaBlame government laws/policies and over regulationsBlame taxes ( one of the highest in the world and will be if Hillary gets into office).Something else you people forget to factor in is that we don't build in America we mainly ASSEMBLE here. Most of the parts are manufactured outside of the country and just assembled here.. At one time the MAJORITY  was made here..
21 | Barbara Reedy | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725914038675 | during the Reagan administration corporations were give financial incentives to lay off workers, close down and retool for machines and robots to tke the workers places.
22 | Bryan Evans | 2 | 10154725620278675_10154725731523675 | Burger King moved their corporate HQ to Canada to avoid taxes.  The garbage men here in our town were replaced by robot arms on the trucks because they were making around 36.00/hr.  Black and Decker moved their manufacturing operation here to Mexico because labor is cheaper and robots don't self repair, calibrate, and maintain themselves.  The AT&T call center I worked for here moved call center jobs to Mexico, Canada, and El Salvador because agents there work for far less than they do here and you don't have to beg then to come to work and work their whole shift.  There are a number of factors to "blame" and enough blame to go around.
23 | Steven P. Miller | 1 | 10154725620278675_10154725790128675 | I think its time to explore other forms of mass transit in the USA. but what do I know, Facebook and their loony algorithms said I wasn't that intelligent.
24 | Walter Schwaneberg | 1 | 10154725620278675_10154725770748675 | This has been going on for decades and is only going to ramp up as smarter robots and software are created. Even white collar jobs are in real jeopardy.
25 | Al Sims | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725989868675 | GM lost 400,000 jobs largely because the UAW allowed the automaker(s) to build cars in the US with mostly foreign parts. Millions of US jobs have been lost to foreign countries.

Next, they attacked, regulated and restricted our local and state police agencies from doing their jobs.  Now, they are attempting to attack, regulate, and restrict our Federal Agencies from doing their jobs.  Complacent in this attack is the politically appointed Attorney General and the office of the Justice Department.Not only has Federal Laws been broken, but state and local laws have been subverted with their tactics.  They use the Liberal Media Outlets for "Disinformation" and they are using scare tactics, deceit and lies to try to win this election so they can complete the cover-up.If the American public is so blind as they can not see this is happening, we will never know the truth.  Liberal media is no longer a trustworthy outlet for honesty, free speech, and truth.  They have allowed their agencies to become part of one of the largest political cover-ups in US History!  We as Americans can not allow this to happen.  Do not vote Hillary Clinton into the Presidency.  This will be remembered as the biggest crime in our political history!

I mean total madness. Who's fault is that anyway? Voters--You allowed it by way of your passivity and half-interested foolishness.

2 | Kirby Chadwick | 52 | 10154725411313675_10154725469243675 | They should just do away with it completely. After the Dakotas, it goes across Iowa, the farming heartland of America, our bread basket. What is disaster that would be if there is a spill.
3 | Gary Mandehr | 4 | 10154725411313675_10154725868493675 | If we even needed this oil, there are better and safer ways to transport it that ensure if, and, or when there is a spill, leak, or rupture, the incident would be smaller in degree of environmental impact. This whole sad situation is all the worst ,  because we don't need this pipeline.
4 | Donna Zeigler-Wood | 4 | 10154725411313675_10154725595498675 | If trump gets in you know it will all go through with orders to wipe out anyone in the way. He has financial interest. Be sure you take the time to vote!!
5 | Jerre Johnson | 3 | 10154725411313675_10154725670818675 | Well just where in the heck are they going to reroute it do where it isn't a potential problem to our waters or crop lands??  Poor planning from the get-go!

7 | James Jolokia | 3 | 10154725411313675_10154725608708675 | No, it has included clashes with peaceful protesters, not the other way around. Seriously, PBS, your bias is shining.

9 | Lu EG | 9 | 10154725411313675_10154725444373675 | My open letter to my fellow democrats/progressives and fellow millennials who are planning to vote for a third party candidate or skip the election:I am NOT writing this to ask you to like Hillary, but to ask you to really, really think hard about what's at stake this election year and vote for her. If you believe we have two terrible options this time, I hear you and I completely understand. And if you were a Bernie Sanders supporter during the primaries, I understand your frustration, I really do. Whatever you think of Hillary, the reality is under no reasonable assessment is she ‚Äújust as bad‚Äù as the racist, sexist, bigoted, divisive, sexual predator Trump. Unlike any major candidate in generations, narcissistic pathological liar Trump is temperamentally, emotionally, morally and intellectually unfit to be President of this great country. Period! I am gonna "tell it like it is" here, saying I will "never" vote for Hillary is a privilege. It is a privilege women, minorities, and Muslims of this great country don't have. Also remember Bernie helped write the 2016 party platform. He used his political capital he raised during the primaries to help draft the most progressive platform in history. Please let me remind you of what's at stake:1. The misogynistic pathetic small man has shown over and over again through out his life he has zero respect for women. He has said cringeworthy horrible/outrageous things about women all his life. He has consistently insulted, belittled, sexualized, and stereotyped women. He is a sexual predator who brags about using his star power to grope, forcibly kiss, and sexually assault women. Now multiple women have accused him of forcibly groping, kissing, and sexually assaulting them just like he bragged about on tape. He has a civil suit against him alleging he raped a 13-year-old girl.  Such disgusting insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land. And he has promised to nominate conservative justices who will limit women's reproductive rights & women's ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. Remember his VP Mike Pence is one of the most anti-choice politicians out there. This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there's no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. Women can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. This sexual predator's comments already perpetuated rape culture in this country, imagine what his presidency will do. 2. Muslim Americans can't afford to have a xenophobic, small-minded bigot and his hate-filled rhetorics. We can NOT afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as con artist Trump. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believes  people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. 3. Black Americans can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights & civil and political rights. 4. The LGBT community can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT believe people should have a right to choose whomever they desire to marry. And his VP pick is the most anti-LGBT politician out there. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years and can not afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back decades.5. We can't afford to have someone who hired David Bossie as his deputy campaign manager as a president. David Bossie was a longtime president of Citizens United, a conservative group best known for the Supreme Court case that overturned campaign financing laws allowing unlimited amount of dark money in our politics so the rich can buy our politicians.  6. We can not afford to have a president who is planning  to dismantle Obama's Wall Street reform laws. That will leave middle-class families out to dry. Reforms like Dodd-Frank, which was passed in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, which left millions of people unemployed or evicted. It took years to recover and still the country is not really recovered fully. We can't afford to have another crisis!!! 7. Student loan crisis is at its ugliest. Millions of Americans are drowning in student loan debt. We can not afford to have a con man whose university was a complete scam as a president. We need a president with a clear plan to tackle this big issue.8. We can not afford to have a person who has said he doesn't believe in man-made climate change and has called global warming a "hoax," as a president. Period! Our planet needs saving! 9. Undocumented immigrants who got relief under  DACA and DAPA can't afford to expose themselves to bigot Trump‚Äôs mass deportation plan. These are millions of people who are contributing to our community and economy.  10. The next president will likely appoint 4 Supreme Court justices. Do you really want a racist, sexist, bigoted con artist sexual predator to be the one? 11. We can't afford to have a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured as a commander-in-chief. A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insulte and deride our generals but offers praise to a number of authoritarian leaders. 12. We can't afford to have a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter to lead our great country. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy never been compassion, it was always self-aggrandizement. A greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion. We can't have a careless small man who consistently incite assault on protesters & keep alluding to violence against Hillary in the White House. That's just to name a few. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. Bernie Sanders said it best: 'This is not the time for a protest vote.'

How do Americans heal this great divide?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Brian Wise | 92 | 10154724096198675_10154725320203675 | Ignorance and bigotry are best treated by education.
2 | Chuck Moore | 41 | 10154724096198675_10154725397503675 | Try being blue in a red state. I'm a communist/socialist, I must get free stuff. I love criminals. I hate my own race. I love minorities and on and on and on.
3 | George F Franks III | 22 | 10154724096198675_10154725350968675 | As technology changed. As corporations became global. And as the middle class evaporated. The US government did a little or nothing. Only an FDR type leader could have stepped in and saved the middle class.
4 | Roger Komula | 13 | 10154724096198675_10154725375508675 | I am not interested in going back and healing the divide. I'm glad people are finally showing what is in their hearts and I think it's time.
5 | John Riley | 16 | 10154724096198675_10154725435178675 | Iowa is a good example. Lots of people on SS. Farm economy completely dependent on the government. Elected a tea party senator, and is going for Trump. Urban areas more likely to democratic. Rural areas where government support is most important will go for Trump.
6 | Ann Weymouth Dean | 13 | 10154724096198675_10154725363333675 | This was so interesting and her theories make sense. Glad she says it's "fixable" although it will take both time and dedication.   Perhaps, one by one, we can make that happen?
7 | Karen Wieland | 15 | 10154724096198675_10154725516513675 | I've been thinking about this! I live in a rural NY county that typically votes 'red.' I find it incredibly ironic how many citizens in my county rely quite heavily on government entitlements, services, and subsidies such as unemployment insurance, SNAP, farm subsidies, Social Security Disability Insurance, CHIP, Medicaid, and of course Social Security and Medicare. These people are staunch in their belief that they are entitled to these programs (but not those other undeserving folks from around the state), and yet they vote for candidates that want to dismantle them. The lack of logic and reason is startling.
8 | Bruce Mccoy | 2 | 10154724096198675_10154725720393675 | There is common ground about what problems to fix, but not about how to fix them. Why didn't she try a northern red state, like Wyoming, they don't think the government is just the North as winner of the Civil War, which she sees as the basis for mistrust. She has that wrong. Jonathan Haidt's book "The Righteous Minid" is more revealing about the differences between right and left, and why is hard to change deeply embedded views.
9 | Dwight Snider | 1 | 10154724096198675_10154725724283675 | Conservatives saw how Nixon made opposition to the Vietnam War a wedge to drive between Republicans and Democrats. Nixon did not even need a majority. He created them by saying they were there but they were "Silent".Seeing this, conservatives went on a binge of building think tanks whose sole purpose was to create more and more wedge issues that demonized liberals. Conservatives are so brainwashed with these wedge issues that they can't break free of them even when they KNOW Donald Trump refutes most of their deeply held values.
10 | William Spencer | 12 | 10154724096198675_10154725337458675 | Issues remaining from our Civil War, that have yet to be completely repaired. Most of our challenges as a society date from either our Civil War or WW2.
11 | Mary Ann Simmons | 3 | 10154724096198675_10154725550353675 | We've become a divided nation of 50 city-states. How can we have 50 interpretations of laws? (abortion, voting, pot, forfeiture) Keeping the courts busy, wasting money, and allowing national government to stand still while a handful become obscenely wealthy.
12 | Peter Stelman | 9 | 10154724096198675_10154725474248675 | "they feel especially Democratic administrations have favored blacks, women, immigrants, refugees. And all of these groups, they see as getting ahead of them, as almost like line-cutters, pushing them back in line."I can understand that feeling toward new immigrants, but to feel that it's unfair to give blacks and women parity in the workplace? It's obvious that blacks and women were oppressed and treated unfairly - and still are. Do these people prefer to keep oppressing them? I bet they wouldn't want the same done to them. What do they think would be fair? Don't black people have to support themselves, and their families, just like white people?
13 | Milton Kenneth Moore III | 2 | 10154724096198675_10154725715993675 | Get rid of extreme ideologues and elect people who care about the people and the country, yeah I know, that will require actual research and factual knowledge.  I think it's worth it.
14 | Frank Bauer | 16 | 10154724096198675_10154725369558675 | Ignorant rednecks. They hate the government SO much, but seem to have no problem with collecting welfare.
15 | Haley Hyatt | 0 | 10154724096198675_10154725867253675 | I'm blue in a red state, and it's not easy. And I just read a comment slamming red state people ending with "Who needs them?" And another condescending comment, "Ignorance and bigotry are best treated by education." Well, certainly education is a great, much needed thing. But you make a mistake by slamming all Red state people, by stereotyping them all as ignorant racists. Some are -- but not all are, by any means. I have friends (to my great despair) who hold Ph.D.'s and are Trumpers. We need to connect and communicate on issues -- while not affecting an attitude of superiority. It alienates people who otherwise might be open to reason. Of course, it feels good to be self-righteous and put down other people as stupid. But it does not endear them in the least to your cause.
16 | Jim Patterson | 4 | 10154724096198675_10154725430643675 | We get over this by NOT electing ANOTHER CLINTON! These people have SLIMED the political landscape for the past 30 plus years only to serve their own personal pleasure!

18 | Mike Taylor | 6 | 10154724096198675_10154725458668675 | Heal the divide? Our " leaders" need to be reminded that an educated society is to everyone's benefit.

Hell for that matter let them do their oun laundry.

Politicians spelunk public opinion using polls like a book of matches to navigate a cave. The match never shows enough ground to choose a safe path, they just stumble in a new direction until they light the next match. No real route to freedom is possible unless things get lighted up.

Under state and federal laws, insurance plans must cover mental health services equally compared to other forms of care. But millions of patients across the country still struggle to get the help they need.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Liz Feeser-Regan | 17 | 10154724064843675_10154725214373675 | There use to be better Mental Health in this country, then along came Ronald Reagan who cut off funding to mental state run hospitals (yes hospitals just for mental health), hence we saw the number of homeless go way up. When a reporter ask him what are you going to do about the homeless his answer. "Tell them to get jobs." This stop the progress of mental health to this country, just think how far we might be today if the funding would have continued. He also stop funding to children's homes and started the foster care system which has always been a mess. Did you know that about 80% of the kids who went through children's homes went on to college in the 50's, 60's and 70's, if you went  to college it was paid for,  compared to 5% who are in foster care.
2 | William H Boley | 8 | 10154724064843675_10154725244153675 | Adequate coverage and some coverage are two different things. And the big for-profit insurance and managed care companies, focused on their bottom line, still control this business. End of story.
3 | Paula Kay Schmidt | 5 | 10154724064843675_10154725466458675 | honestly, until the US addresses the mental health crisis in this country we will continue to be plagued with mass shootings, domestic violence and other forms of evil

It's horribly discriminatory because it leads to a lifetime of subpar healthcare for the poor because we end up just skipping treatment for conditions that may not be life-threatening, but they do affect the quality of our lives.  OUR employers do pay the same premiums as the employers of affluent patients, and WE end up subsidizing the rich because we don't draw down the benefits. It's disgusting!

22 | Christopher Idol | 0 | 10154724064843675_10154725645798675 | The most expensive, least-effective, and most damaging drugs on the planet:  mental health medications.    They're always forcibly applied or the patients are coerced with privileges or freedoms to take them.  Life spans are cut short by 20 or 30 years, people are turned into zombies when their brains swell and no one benefits from this but the doctors and pharmaceutical companies.      Put the mental health money into the counselors that really do make a difference, the substance abuse treatment, not replacement, (no Suboxone), and teaching people how to eat healthy foods and live an active and healthy lifestyle, which includes drinking plenty of water!  That's all we need.  Insurance costs for one person on one mental health drug could provide all the other needed services for 10 people in the same time period.  Until you decide to help the patient, not the pharmaceutical company and the doctor, we'll all go bankrupt with the efforts being made on behalf of the mentally ill.  That's crazy!
23 | Mary Anderson | 0 | 10154724064843675_10154725303653675 | What's infuriating is 2016 Presidential election with hardly one word on one the most serious issue, timely healthcare delivery. Thus, how will any aged person who's in need of HEALTHCARE obtain a wide list of care needed: variety of mental health care that includes our nation's widespread substance abuse of alcohol + drugs, dental care for moms who's teeth are rotten, MRIs repeats in one year when spinal tumors suspected, vaccines that were $10, now $25, ... An  endless list of unmet medical & dental needs. If T rump , Rubio ...elected, than get less healthcare delivered. But more wrinkles treatments, plastic surgery , but no dangerous mole removal. Watch and see the downhill decline we'll receive. Increase in "health savings accounts" without a livable wage, paying for basics, ...expect a vanishing healthcare delivery system.  ... And more wars.

Does Donald Trump prove that political consultants are unnecessary?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Richard Boyer | 6 | 10154724004618675_10154724509383675 | Trumps a bit of a one off, his strength is saying whatever the people in the room want to hear with conviction and a straight face. A politician that really wants to do that as a career, rather than a chance to pump up his ego, listens to people with insight.
2 | Remy Jagla | 4 | 10154724004618675_10154724466303675 | If you listen to them...yes. If you blatantly ignore them, it's a huge waste of money. Basically, your campaign / presidency will fall apart at some point if you are a major douche canoe. You might get elected even without help but at some point, arrogance will get you no where fast. Trump'a ship has sailed though. He not only ignored his help but he flipped them off metaphorically speaking from the stage. He might as well let them all go now, save some cash. Since he only likes the sound of his own voice.
3 | Valleri Churchill Callahan | 0 | 10154724004618675_10154725341168675 | No, it just proves that Donald Trump is incapable of listening and staying on track. There is a portion of the population that will always be attracted to demagogues. If he truly had the chops to be president he'd LISTEN to people who do politics for a career. He lacks the wisdom to do so. However, people who like him overlook his ignorance and hubris.
4 | Tom Stowe | 0 | 10154724004618675_10154725396153675 | All you need is the right message to sell to your particular audience. Donald Trump has seemingly tapped into that portion of America that is pissed off, and through his Bombastic Rhetoric he has pumped them up. Hillary Clinton on the other hand is still playing the politician, and she has to stay with in the confines of the political playbook. Raw Unrefined Energy vs Controlled Pandering. All you really need is to be a smooth talking salesperson, who can sell yourself to those you're trying to control. In the end I haven't been sold on either's product line. United We Stand, Divided We Fall.

7 | Sj Lag | 0 | 10154724004618675_10154724542593675 | Jeb Bush probably not the best example because I just do not think He wanted or needed to be the next President of the United States compared to someone like Senator McCain. No paid consultant can replace that fire inside the candidate themselves. This is not a criticism of Jeb Bush, good man great family . Perhaps His time was earlier 2012 . Senator McCain set the world of fire with his passion. I voted twice for President Obama but there are good people on all sides in politics and we should not be afraid to say so.

California‚Äôs Prop. 58 aims to expand bilingual education. Here‚Äôs how both sides see that issue.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Beth Grant DeRoos | 3 | 10154724002173675_10154724607063675 | We are a multilingual family yet this piece and Prop 58 are so Spanish language focused. Why? Our biggest competition is China, which is why I support bilingual education that stresses Mandarin Chinese.
2 | Elaine Shute | 2 | 10154724002173675_10154725086773675 | With no background in education, and quoting no sources, where does Ron Unz come off declaring that bilingual education doesn't work? Why is anyone even listening to him?Why didn't this news piece focus on that?
3 | Chad Ashton Robbins | 1 | 10154724002173675_10154724554613675 | Nope!! Teaching native English speakers to speak Spanish is stupid considering that the overwhelming amount of  Hispanics people in this country are bilingual already. So why waste tax dollars to teach native English speakers to be able to speak to what....3% of the US population?
4 | William Maxwell | 1 | 10154724002173675_10154724629388675 | Let's take care of our own first. Many of the black kids in my mixed-race neighborhood speak English as if they had just stepped off the Mississippi cotton Plantation last week with no foreign languages under their belt. Communication is the key to succes and they desperately need help
5 | Rick Moreno | 3 | 10154724002173675_10154724370103675 | The children will automatically learn the language of the country they grow up in. They have friends, playmates, schoolmates, etc. that speak [English] When I started school in the 60's I didn't know the language. In one school year I learned. Now, I'm more fluent in English than Spanish.
6 | Cate Callahan | 2 | 10154724002173675_10154724269993675 | I wonder, though, if it would be better for the kids to spend one year just learning to read, speak and write English, then to enter the grade level best for them.
7 | Sj Lag | 0 | 10154724002173675_10154724549278675 | Hope it passes teach the children in any language they can succeed in. They will pick up English quickly with out the stress. Forcing children to give up their first language is wrong. Tell them how lucky they are to know Two languages and what a wonderful asset that ability will be in the future.
8 | Ric Brown | 11 | 10154724002173675_10154724153803675 | The U.S. is among relatively few countries on the planet that does not REQUIRE bilingualism from its students.
9 | Bryan Evans | 1 | 10154724002173675_10154724176213675 | Focusing on teaching in Spanish instead of improving English as a second language is not doing them any favors.
10 | Janet Wheaton | 5 | 10154724002173675_10154724185783675 | Teaching basic subjects in Spanish until kids are fluent enough in English to understand keeps them from getting behind and encourages them to stay in school.
11 | Shane Alg | 2 | 10154724002173675_10154724598128675 | I wish we'd stick with science, the best scientifically proven methods, and leave politics out of how we teach our kids.

16 | Corrie Beversdorf Vonfeldt | 0 | 10154724002173675_10154725801793675 | There are a lot of benefits to being bilingual.  I don't know about this specific bill as I live in WI.  However, I am currently pregnant and know very minimal Spanish from the two years I took in high school.  I plan on learning Spanish and teaching my child as I go so that we can both be bilingual.
17 | Claire Bascara | 1 | 10154724002173675_10154724468888675 | Great story on Adelante Spanish Immersion School!  So happy that all three of our kids were able to enjoy their elementary years learning both Spanish and English at Adelante :)  Dan Bascara

23 | Duke Marryshow | 0 | 10154724002173675_10154725439458675 | Studies have shown that bilingualism boosts cognitive functions. That's enough of a reason.  We do not need smarter people.

1 | Michele A Wilcox | 55 | 10154724000348675_10154724080278675 | Trump's been in 4,056 lawsuits, and found guilty of breaking federal law 237 times. He's currently under investigation for:1. Illegally using his charity for personal legal fees and fines.2. Trump University- fraud, racketeering, and misrepresentation.3. Raping a 13 yr old girl. Trial brings Dec. 16, 2016. Case 1:16-cv-04642 Filed 06/20/16.4. Illegally paying off the Florida Attorney General to avoid being investigated for Trump University.5. Illegally violating US laws under the Cuba embargo.And, he's been found guilty of rape 4 times and sexual assault 20 times, all of which he negotiated a plea deal to pay the women off.Most comprehensive research on Trump's lawsuits and criminal indictments:http://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/trump-lawsuits/
2 | David Smith | 20 | 10154724000348675_10154724063898675 | If the FBI had done their job correctly from the start Hillary wouldn't be an option. Bernie would be in and the election would be far different.
3 | William Miller | 8 | 10154724000348675_10154724186978675 | Don't we want our journalists to be neutral? I cannot express my disappointment in the NewsHour..  No, I am not a supporter of either major candidate.  Frankly, I am dreading Nov. 8; voting for the lesser of two evils, doesn't really work for me,as you're still voting  for evil.  That being said, I cannot believe how the NewsHour has changed; I think it corresponds with the exit of the MacNeil Lehrer production company A couple years ago. Their reporting is blatantly proClinton, at least a half dozen times Judy W. and her guests made mention of the possible connection of Trump or his advisor(s) with Russia.  Yet, there was no reference to the article in yesterday's NY Times that said the FBI has NOT found any connection. Judy's guests mentionEd that the FBI has become politicized - how about the President's comments yesterday or the day before stating that he had full confidence in the Director and that he was a man of intrigity. Furthermore, I don't seem to recall  in July after Director Comey decided not to recommend charges be pursued that the Newshour claimed that the FBI was politicized.  It's not the FBI but rather the media that's been politicized.  Lastly, the Newshour timidly reported that the polls showed the race is tightening.  However, the most recent polls show Trump either tied or ahead.  So,  Judy and Gwen what is going on!
4 | Chuck Finley | 3 | 10154724000348675_10154724206603675 | Shame on you HewsHour. You need to be re-branded the Hillary Channel. There is nothing fair and balanced about your election coverage. You're not even pretending to be unbiased. Every mention of Trump is negative; every mention of Clinton is positive or neutral. You have permanently damaged your brand! I hoping you all get fired. This assessment is from a citizen that is NOT a TRUMP supporter. Trump being elected President is the second worse result America could have. I waiver between a protest vote for Johnson or a vote for Trump only to stop the Criminal Clinton Empire. Your biased reporting only pushes me to vote for Trump (something I really don't want to do)!

8 | William Isenberg | 3 | 10154724000348675_10154724147103675 | She is an assault to justice. The FBI needs to find intent on Hillary's emails? 18 U.S. Code 2071 states the following in section B: "Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.

9 | Eric Turner | 0 | 10154724000348675_10154724125293675 | These people are standing up purporting to be the best and the brightest, the most earnest and trustworthy people available to head this government, and asking us to judge them accordingly on election day. Whichever one of them wins will have a staggeringly immense amount of power and authority along with unprecedented insight into -->OUR<-- private affairs and interests.There is absolutely no amount of information about them that is too much or too candid for the Public to weigh and measure. That is true for all those who hold positions of Trust and Authority over the People. If they want their personal privacy, they are perfectly free to remain in the private sector and then they will only have to worry about who in government has access to their secrets and what is being done with it.... just like the rest of us.
10 | Elaine Shute | 0 | 10154724000348675_10154725093783675 | Trump supporters aren't interested in "learning" things. I'm not being sarcastic. Heard an advisor to the Trump campaign interviewed who said facts don't matter, it's all about "how we make them(voters) feel".

I'm not saying Trump didn't do it, but usually just in response to what was being thrown his way as a matter of dumping it where it belonged right back at them. But at least he talked about his position and plans which is more than I can say about Clinton. However at this point in time Johnson is the only viable option for America
13 | Julie Rosenwinkel | 2 | 10154724000348675_10154724343878675 | Hillary Clinton is pure evil.

Seriously -- we don't know everything? hmmm, okay, I personally do not know if she wears underwire or not -- gotta say, I truly don't care, but some numbnuts might...What don't I know about The Donald?  He's been flashing us for pretty much the same 3 decades...  we watched him fail -- yes, bankruptcy is FAILURE, I like successful business people, don't you?  We watched him mistreat 2 wives, cheating and leaving them, marry a third who he also cheats on, good family values? I don't think so...   his is indicted and being taken to court for theft of services (by hundreds of companies and individuals), rape of a child, and a variety of unethical and often illegal business practices...   and Oh, yes...  despite them trying to surpress it: the FBI has at least one open investigation ongoing...
19 | Scott Short | 0 | 10154724000348675_10154725397333675 | I have been perplexed by Trump's slogan "Make American Great Again" - what he is referring too, what era? It suddenly dawned on me he is talking about the 1970's early 80's, when sex, greed & excess was celebrated, when gold plated everything was stylish & being a playboy was interesting...that was *His* era. Most of us learned from the mistakes of that time , but he stayed there & worse he wants to go back there. He wants to once again be celebrated as the King of Greed , selfishness , and ego - he didn't learn - he didn't grow - he never became a more aware human. He wants to go back there so badly he is willing to destroy this country if he doesn't get there. That's my take.

21 | Donna Madrid-Simonetti | 21 | 10154724000348675_10154724043063675 | No. Early voted for Hillary. Would have anyway. Just lost any respect or faith in our now openly corrupt FBI. #imWithHer
22 | Candance Peace | 0 | 10154724000348675_10154724714373675 | Trump talked about the voting being ridged, never have I ever heard that you can change a vote after you have voted. I guess as long as it is in his favor it's alright.
23 | Tommy Cotton | 7 | 10154724000348675_10154724044198675 | The DNC did this to themselves, they knew Hillary was damaged, Bernie would of clearly beaten Trump. I'm not with Her...
24 | Jim Williams | 0 | 10154724000348675_10154724492093675 | Hillary Clinton has been under attack for 25 years by the Right Wing smear machine. Donald Trump not only has been given a pass by the U.S. news media, they have been his biggest PAC by covering every thing he has said and done without questioning whether any of it is true. Trump lied about President Obama's birth certificate and built a political career on that racist Birther lie. And now, PBS has the grotesque audacity to suggest there is some kind of moral equivalence between Secretary Clinton and Donald Trump. For example, if Secretary Clinton was scheduled to appear in court this November and December for massive fraud and raping a 13 year old boy, PBS and the rest of the media would have it as their leading story and headline very day. That is why most Americans don't know the truth about Donald Trump. U.S. media has failed this country.
25 | Donna Paulson | 1 | 10154724000348675_10154724282968675 | I had read that the FBI and CIA had Vetted Hillary years ago for the job of Secretary of State and they said she was the most honest person to be vetted by them. Then when all this trumped up email crap came up, again, they had to hit the investigation of her again. Then they stated the same after a tough vetting process. So I am tired of the republican lies, as that's why I left that party. I have already voted blue for the most qualified person to ever run, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

The traditional "Day of the Dead" got started a little early in Mexico City, where a parade featured more than a 1,000 dancers, acrobats and actors. PBS NewsHour Weekend's Alison Stewart reports that it was inspired, in part, by SPECTRE.

Every year from November 1-2, both Mexicans and people around the world honor their loved ones with offerings or ofrendas displayed on colorful altars decorated with pictures, bright flowers, candles, and their favorite foods and beverages. Today's Doodle captures the intricate tissue-paper cutouts that have been used in Mexican celebrations since the 18th century.

"Concerning the ordination of women in the Catholic Church, St. Pope John Paul II had the last clear word on this and it stands, this stands,"  the pope said today.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Janet Fredmund Kuplinski | 483 | 10154723729748675_10154723948218675 | Well the Catholic church is and will continue to see numbers dwindle as modern women realize the male dominated hierarchy is not good for them.
2 | Kim Ann Silfven | 233 | 10154723729748675_10154723960828675 | Probably the main reason I left the church was its stance on all things female, or even all things not heterosexual white male.
3 | Anne Gilmer Merson | 159 | 10154723729748675_10154724015148675 | And yet women have been the most ancient priestess of early history. And healers as well. The Catholic Church is denying all the spiritual contributions that women bring to this earth.
4 | Julie Worley | 87 | 10154723729748675_10154723942523675 | Funny how many religions don't allow women in leadership positions... Islam, LDS, Catholics, Baptists, Evangelicals, Orthodox, Judaism... come to mind right off the bat. And, how many women go along with it.
5 | Nancy Mac | 95 | 10154723729748675_10154723959848675 | Because religion is all about domination. But so glad folks are slowly waking up and are having faith in themselves instead of a world of the supernatural.
6 | Christine Turner | 81 | 10154723729748675_10154724009433675 | This is why I left the Roman Catholic church. I am now an Episcopalian. God gave the two most important tasks of bringing Christ into the world to women: His birth and the news of his resurrection. I will allow no man to limit my ability to carry Christ's light into the world. Here endth the lesson.
7 | Meg Stiles | 54 | 10154723729748675_10154723947528675 | Because religion will always be about empowerment of men over women. Which is why I will never affiliate with any of them.
8 | Laurel Kalinoski | 41 | 10154723729748675_10154723986978675 | This is disappointing. The Catholic church needs to evolve. The nuns do all the dirty work and get no respect,priests can't marry,but they can counsel on marriage. The Catholic church doesn't realize we're not in the dark ages anymore. Also,when it's time for a new pope,they will go backwards by choosing an ultra conservative one. Francis has been somewhat of a renegade for many to stomach.
9 | Joseph Sousa | 41 | 10154723729748675_10154723938953675 | Priest should be married and male or female they should be equally able to serve GOD. To not be the catholic church will self destruct . Such an exclusionary church and one that I belong to.
10 | Theresa Riga | 39 | 10154723729748675_10154724008903675 | It is the mother/maternal figure who nurtures religion in children.  It is the mother/maternal figure who makes sure the children get to church, put their weekly donation in the basket, take their Sacrements, and give thanks at the dinner table.  If the Roman Catholic church chooses to continue seeing women as subordinate, even though it was a woman who bore Jesus, and women who stood by his side and wept as he hung from the cross, then it's time for modern women to stop donating to an organization that devalues them and all they do to preserve the faith, and create their own religious organization.
11 | Cynthia Plumstead Hollenbeck | 19 | 10154723729748675_10154724201143675 | That is reason enough for every female to leave the Catholic church.  And every father of a female.  And every brother, husband, cousin, son.  Any religion that doesn't value women as well as men in this day and age has got to go.
12 | Kay Baron | 25 | 10154723729748675_10154723977413675 | just can't see how they could possibly share the wealth!  It will always be a boy's club...even though the really EARLY church included women is everything!
13 | Krista Behymer | 28 | 10154723729748675_10154724007188675 | Don't hold your breath waiting for the church to join this century no matter how cuddly this pope may seem. The church is only interested in controlling women not ever treating them as equals.
14 | Anna Mountain | 18 | 10154723729748675_10154724070303675 | Well Pope Francis to say this is disappointing is an understatement. I hope women continue to leave the church in recorder numbers. The mysogyny of the Catholic Church is a shameful fact. I thought you were a progressive--too bad. I expected more from the man, who said that the Garden of Eden was a myth. The reasoning behind the mysogyny in the Catholic Church is also based on myths, not the least of which was the apple in the Garden of Eden.  Shame on you.
15 | Anne Fitzgerald | 8 | 10154723729748675_10154724126003675 | this long held "policy" is indicative of the power of women.  The Catholic church knows it and that's why they have refused to allow women carry any position that carries power, it is out of shear fear that women can and will do a much better job at being inclusive, compassionate, and bringing people together regardless of their sexual orientation, and regardless of how much they tithe, and that is the polar opposite of how the church has been run under the "leadership" of men, and will continue to run itself into the ground as long as they continue to disregard women
16 | Roseann Sparks | 5 | 10154723729748675_10154724325718675 | The Catholic Church is a joke. They covered up and protected pedophile priests and are still protecting. Send Cardinal Bernard Law back to the states to answer for his protection of pedophile priests in Boston. He protected one priest accused of molesting 130 children. There is no excuse or rationalization for this. Shame, shame on them!!!
17 | Roxanne Moger | 3 | 10154723729748675_10154724646663675 | I know so many truly wise and wonderful women ministers in the Protestant denominations. It makes me sad to think that Catholic congregations will never experience Christ and Christian fellowship through women priests.
18 | Lorraine Alden | 5 | 10154723729748675_10154724109823675 | The Catholic Church exists to promote and entrench patriarchy. Luckily there are other doctrines that enfranchise females. For example, the Episcopal Church of American has music, incense, ministry, traditional dogma, and High Church ritual while offering women and the LGBTQ community equality and respect.
19 | Pat Smith | 6 | 10154723729748675_10154724304903675 | They just don't get it. Any religion or culture that makes women second class citizens lack concern for alll members of the human race.
20 | Margaret Feightner | 2 | 10154723729748675_10154725296823675 | Once again the Catholic Church is permitted to discriminate against women because a group of men, living in an era when women were treated as chattel, decided to keep the power of the church to themselves.  It is more than time for this church to recognize that leaders can be female.
21 | Karen Babri | 5 | 10154723729748675_10154724295528675 | Pope Francis is missing a golden opportunity to benefit from the theological insights of half the world's population. This is very disappointing. Pope Francis had created so much good will, this position on the priesthood for women is unraveling that good will.
22 | Jackie Ofner | 6 | 10154723729748675_10154724117408675 | I am so shocked that a patriarchal religion would say that !!  Do the nuns live in gorgeous castles in Italy and around the world?  No, they do n't. Do the high level priests? Yes, they do. There you have it.
23 | Sue Murphy | 7 | 10154723729748675_10154724147148675 | Sad,very sad.I'm a 74 yr old Catholic ,but man it pisses me off when this pope acts like a  jerk.  l thought he would be more in tune with the times ! I really don't think Jesus cares .He wants us to love Him & to love & be kind to one another .
24 | Gaby Lacrampe | 0 | 10154723729748675_10154725369818675 | Pope Francis is referencing the late pope‚Äôs 1994 declaration that the church has ‚Äúno authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women.‚Äù Really? But it has the authority to decide it's a "boys only" club? Although it was Mary if Magdala who preached the Gospel first? She was mentioned more in the Bible than any of the disciplines. Men are making up stuff to continue their power play rather than focusing on scripture. "Thy will, not mine", guys...
25 | Jacqui Macdonald | 7 | 10154723729748675_10154724074753675 | Why would any women be a Catholic. What he is basically saying is that women do not have the ear of God. Left the church because of their dogma and rituals that don't make sense in this world today.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Paul Williams | 277 | 10154723592108675_10154723893978675 | And if the Democrats take control of the Senate, the Republicans can all be true to their party and keep on digging that do-nothing hole deeper. Along with shutting down the government, threatening to, and now vowing not to do their constitutional duty, the GOP seems hell-bent on immolation. God speed.
2 | Michael OConnor | 221 | 10154723592108675_10154723883178675 | I'll admit that trump has done something no presidential candidate has ever done, he's been able to get the KGB and the FBI to work together. Amazing !!
3 | Marti Watson Garlett | 127 | 10154723592108675_10154723938498675 | How can one constitutional branch of the government shut out another constitutional branch of the government? In a Republican-controlled Congress, they've done it with the other two branches. I'm beyond outraged. I'm exhausted by a democracy that fails to do the work of the people, not to mention the Constitution's imperatives.
4 | Lou H Brothers | 99 | 10154723592108675_10154723906903675 | Let's do deep cleaning in the Congress! Is the only progressive solution! All the way Blue, no matter what!!!
5 | Shawn Spence | 71 | 10154723592108675_10154723908263675 | Need a Democrat senate, then. I'm not a strong partisan of either side, but we need a Congress that will do the bare minimum of its job, at least.
6 | Cheryl Belcher | 30 | 10154723592108675_10154723986798675 | It isn't too late to vote some of those obstructionists out of office.  We need to get back to a working government, it is ridiculous
7 | Jackie Carmichael | 27 | 10154723592108675_10154723958668675 | "We the People" need to grow a set and stop pandering to lobbyists and cheap, nasty political moves to weaken the world stance of the USA. Obama has done a great job, despite some of the worst obstructionism in modern history. The American people really need to start taking a real interest in the truth behind all this crap and get those GOPs out of office.
8 | William H Boley | 30 | 10154723592108675_10154723904583675 | I hope the GOP tries to do this. This all opposition, do nothing approach did not work with the budget, and I don't think the people will accept this in relation to the Supreme Court.
9 | Troy Luster | 15 | 10154723592108675_10154723910908675 | I expect that Democrats would do the same to Trump's nominations if he is elected. In either case I hope the public votes all those stone walling congressmen and women out of office who sit on their hands and refuse to fulfill their constitutionally mandated duty of acting on the President's nominations.
10 | John Ferris | 16 | 10154723592108675_10154724024073675 | The Republicans have trouble accepting the outcome of elections. When The Turtle stiffed the president on his court pick, he mewled that "the next president" should make the choice. Then, when it becomes evident the next president will be a Democrat, all bets are off. It's not at all unlike Trump throwing shade at electoral integrity -- accepting the outcome only should he win.   Elections have consequences.
11 | Michelle Lambeau | 18 | 10154723592108675_10154724056838675 | Senators swear an oath to uphold the Constitution, which explicitly requires them to vote, "advise and consent," on the president's Supreme Court nominees. If they cannot handle having to vote, they should drop out if they're running, or resign if they are already in office. If they falsely swear their oaths, on the record, they are faithless and should be impeached.
12 | Daniel Barrera | 11 | 10154723592108675_10154724183618675 | The people have spoken and voted Obama to a second term and he has been entrusted to nominate a supreme court justice and congress to do their job so that we the people have a full complement of justices to try the people's cases. Can Congress be held in some sort of contempt and be censured by one of the other branches of government for not doing their job?
13 | Patricia M Wieneke | 14 | 10154723592108675_10154724089903675 | Vote them out of office. They are priding themselves on tearing down the American Democratic system. If they don't like it, they shouldn't be holding office and gettting paid for being a part of it.
14 | Karen Peterson | 11 | 10154723592108675_10154723895793675 | Will someone please show me the republican'ts who support this mindset? This is unconscionable! There is a reason we have an odd number of justices. Constituents please tell me why you will go along with this.
15 | Millie Demille | 8 | 10154723592108675_10154724074758675 | You know, I'm sick of the GOP blocking what is good for the country. They blocked soooo many ideas that Obama tried to change, for the GOOD of the country. Trump says there has to be change, well....there would have been, if not for the GOP.
16 | Sharlene Silva | 5 | 10154723592108675_10154724091693675 | It would be fun to watch the pet issues of the conservative movement crash on the rocks of a SCOTUS tie, won't it?  That's how this strategy can backfire - tied cases go back down as if they never happened.  The Republicans have already lost a couple of cases that way.
17 | Terry Carpenter | 8 | 10154723592108675_10154723914168675 | So I guess the Supreme Court is obsolete since the GOP wants to rig the system in their favor.  Let's limit the states to two senators and two congresspeople each one Democrat and one Republican.
18 | Gareth Fales | 13 | 10154723592108675_10154723915813675 | It would appear it all boils down to our educational system. It seems our politicians are somewhat educated at best but never learned the one word they need most in DC. Compromise.
19 | Tenno Andra | 5 | 10154723592108675_10154723976328675 | I'm pretty sure that that is illegal (certainly immoral, whether or NOT!!!!) -- If nothing else, we citizen's should have the right to personally, physically: remove, torture or debilitate ...or, just, excersize the voting privileges of ANY of these, supposed, "representatives," who will not, do not or are incapable of performing their jobs!
20 | Julie B. Reiley | 0 | 10154723592108675_10154725616128675 | This is disheartening, and is huge step toward dismantling our constitutional democracy.    In a significant way, it's robbing American citizens of their vote for POTUS.  In any event, if this persists, I think POTUS, whoever she is, should really consider convening hearings, inviting  the entire Senate of course, and then invite them to vote; any senator who waives his right to participate does just that.
21 | Odonnell Sanders | 7 | 10154723592108675_10154723928798675 | It's sad that people will let this country be without a full bench just because they can't have control meanwhile profess their love of country.
22 | Gloria Tury | 4 | 10154723592108675_10154724022988675 | I'm demanding they all be arrested! Replacements be voted in , the lobbyist thrown out! And performance reports be part of the news!
23 | Margo Duarte McIntire | 5 | 10154723592108675_10154724079963675 | What recourse do the American people have if they make good on this threat?  Can we sue all the senators who do this for breach of duty? Is a recall vote campaign an option?
24 | David Marshall | 7 | 10154723592108675_10154723929498675 | That's just fine because they are going to be gone from controlling the House and the Senate and then Obama will take his seat as a Supreme Court Justice.
25 | Shelley Powell | 2 | 10154723592108675_10154724535038675 | I am so sick of the obstructionist republican senate and house. Vote em all out and let's get something done for our country. Pass the Clinton jobs bill to restore our infrastructure, fix Obamacare, fix immigration to name a couple. Vote a straight blue ticket!

1 | AMendi Wilkins | 246 | 10154723684893675_10154723716383675 | You do a huge disservice for children of the future by NOT teaching other languages early on. The rest of the world has already beat us to the punch.
2 | Lela Northcross Wakely | 174 | 10154723684893675_10154723705198675 | Since a "foreign language" is now mandatory for HS & most colleges, why not start in when the child is open to learning two languages?
3 | Alexander Constantine Salmas | 104 | 10154723684893675_10154723724388675 | They are still taught English while retaining their native language. Bilingualism and multilingualism is good for the brain.
4 | Margaret Bedard | 91 | 10154723684893675_10154723719198675 | Bilingual kids largely have better developed cognitive process. It's about way more than just language.
5 | Janine Marie | 69 | 10154723684893675_10154723736048675 | My granddaughter just started Montessori pre school, they are teaching her three languages at age 4 years old. Public Elementary schools should teach a second language to children in the USA.
6 | Cindy Wynia Aisenbrey | 49 | 10154723684893675_10154723740193675 | This reaction against having more than one language spoken in the school seems to be part of the dumbing-down of America.....
7 | Cindy Wynia Aisenbrey | 51 | 10154723684893675_10154723722408675 | we should all learn a second possibly third and fourth language like they do in other countries it is good for your brain it helps in learning other things as well so as an educational benefit it is great.
8 | Charlene Goins Amann Hart | 33 | 10154723684893675_10154723726763675 | I think English and Spanish should be taught to all of our children. Spanish is the most widely spoken langusge in the world.
9 | Leonor Alvim Brazao | 42 | 10154723684893675_10154723723968675 | Teach as many languages as possible! It develop children cognition and it makes them global citizens!!
10 | Gloria Nwosu | 8 | 10154723684893675_10154723716338675 | I don't think bilingual education is important to teach in schools! Focus on English! I didn't get it but my youngest sister did. Our children need to strengthen their reading and writing skills!

12 | Ralph Rosario | 14 | 10154723684893675_10154723798993675 | Those against "learning" another language are just stupid. Learn as much as you can. " live like you will die tomorrow and learn like you will live forever",Ghandi.
13 | Joan Scott | 26 | 10154723684893675_10154723725778675 | Kids can certainly learn more languages...the earlier the better! Better off as adults!
14 | Trina Smith | 15 | 10154723684893675_10154723757203675 | I think that every child in the US should learn English & Spanish. All children need both to successfully move through the future!!!!!
15 | Cathy Nordeng | 8 | 10154723684893675_10154723714153675 | When I arrived in the US at 5 years of age I did not speak English and just got shipped to kindergarten...the original total immersion method~
16 | Gwen Ferguson | 10 | 10154723684893675_10154723802598675 | I speak English, Spanish and French. Multilingualism is beautiful - you can connect with so many more people and cultures. Bilingual programs work. I taught first grade in such a program in the 70's.
17 | Ron Pariseau | 8 | 10154723684893675_10154723784033675 | Well when I was in high school back in the '60's, we had a choice of secondary languages, French, Spanish and Latin, but English was first and foremost and should continue to do so!
18 | Glenn Stevens | 10 | 10154723684893675_10154723761968675 | I will say that I'm kinda impressed that some xenophobic folks have made their way to PBS Newshour to share their mostly unenlightened views.
19 | Jim Rambaldini | 6 | 10154723684893675_10154723761363675 | Clearly American schools need to develop better math, writing and science skills. Please, let's get the basics covered with the limited resources public school have.
20 | Yirm'ya Shabin | 6 | 10154723684893675_10154724007073675 | As a taxpayer, I look at it this way. We either invest the money to educate them in elementary, middle, and high school, or we invest the money to keep them on welfare afterwards.
21 | Hercules Payton Jr | 19 | 10154723684893675_10154723725313675 | language is a gift, the more you know the better respect you get from others who speak the language.

23 | Steven Joseph Anderson | 17 | 10154723684893675_10154723733228675 | It just make sense to me, how being multi-lingual builds a better brain. I am trying to learn sign language.
24 | Jennifer Lynch Wheatley | 14 | 10154723684893675_10154723727328675 | Teach as many languages a possible-it is a bonus as you get older and apply for jobs.
25 | Susan Carroll | 1 | 10154723684893675_10154724534078675 | All students should be bilingual, not just the native Spanish speakers. Native English speakers should speak a second language. Time to catch up with planet Earth.

As a group, people living in suburbs ‚Äî even in states that voted reliably Republican for decades ‚Äî are younger, more liberal and more diverse than ever before.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Martin Horton | 46 | 10154723551243675_10154723650278675 | We can only hope that the GOP is close to dying out. Or alternatively, they could instead become a sensible party and forget trickle down economics, the desire for a theocracy and an obsession with women's health.
2 | Michele A Wilcox | 21 | 10154723551243675_10154723676478675 | When Republicans started going down the whacky road, they lost people overall. Sane people tend to think for themselves instead of relying on 60-second sound bytes. Sane people prefer substantiated facts, not one-line gotcha moments.
3 | Les Samuelson | 5 | 10154723551243675_10154723763678675 | No.  When you live in the suburbs you soon realize that you're paying for the people in the inner cities: Your taxes go way up and that makes you realize what a scam the tax system is and therefore you're now republican.
4 | Clifford D. Nichols | 5 | 10154723551243675_10154723993713675 | I don't often express my political views, but  I feel compelled to express my resentment over the biased reporting by the media. I am 71 years old and have watched PBS news hour for most of my life and new they were left leaning, but this election cycle they have gone to far in supporting CH, a proven self serving liar. You have lost my support for ever. So shameful. Sicking to Call you a news program.
5 | Kyle Wittorff | 2 | 10154723551243675_10154724032108675 | Older Americans and poor white trash are the new base. Poor white trash numbers are growing because of Republican policy. It's oddly reciprocal, in a bad way.
6 | Adam Swartz | 2 | 10154723551243675_10154723634403675 | I would say really depends where. Take Kansas City for example, on the MO side sure they've mellowed and become more diverse. On the KS side specifically Johnson County like Overland Park, Leawood, Mission you're firmly in Red republican land and those kids are fairly brainwashed in except on marriage equality
7 | Edward Hand | 4 | 10154723551243675_10154723683823675 | This year is very Odd. You have Republican establishment voting for Hillary, You have a lot of rank and file Democrats voting for Trump. I think a lot of the Democrats still voting for Hillary miss George W. and the Koch Brothers.  Have the Republicans lost the suburbs? Who cares, The Republicans as we know them are going the way of the Whig party. Who knows what we're going to be left with.
8 | Carmen Pesantes | 0 | 10154723551243675_10154724578933675 | Of course it is, community colleges are biased far left liberals, forcing this kind of curriculum to these young adults who don't even know. They are even going as far as introducing it in the earlier school years. It's the truth what I am saying. What ever happened to letting them choose on their own, you have biased professors saying things like "Hillary is the best choice" or "Donald Trump is an orange man" Really?

So I ask are these extreme messages for " Trump's "bigoted, deceitful campaign and white skin nationalistic vision for America?  Just more proof that Donald "has mainstreamed and normalized white nationalists, xenophobes, and bigots of all descriptions!"

15 | Lu EG | 8 | 10154723551243675_10154723586243675 | Decades worth of Republican elites' strategy have brought the orange lying machine this close to the presidency. The culmination of their efforts courting the votes of racists, bigots, xenophobes, "Christian" fundamentalists, and other elements of the extreme right gave us the dangerous narcissistic sociopath. That sexual predator is their Southern Strategy on steroids, he is a product of their party's decades of hate mongering, fear-mongering, and anti intellectualism. On top of all that the Republican elites spent the past eight years cultivating the narcissistic pathological liar's current base of support by pandering to, and embrace of right-wing extremists including their conspiracy theories, and their unprecedented obstruction created massive gridlock in congress leading to an unhealthy atmosphere where NOTHING that help regular people get done. In all, they fed the monster for far too long. Now he‚Äôs devouring the party inside out and about to destroy this great country and the world, if the American people don't stop him. After decades of Republicans claiming to be patriotic and wrapping themselves in the flag, now they are wrapping themselves in Putin's Puppet. If these so called "leaders" can't stand up to this weak, ignorant, useless coward, they will never have the strength to take on ISIS or any other enemy of this great country. The Party of Lincoln died the day the republicans let this dangerous demagogue take over their party. My fellow democrats/progressives, it is time to send a loud and clear message to republicans and the world. Let's go out and vote blue up and down the ballot in record numbers to make congress work again. To stop the crazy gridlock and dysfunction on Capitol Hill.The most terrifying historical parallel is how republicans keep trying to normalize the lunatic just like German right wing did Hitler. The German right wing viewed Hitler in strikingly similar terms to how Republican elites view Trump today. They horribly underestimated his fanaticism, which Hitler had downplayed in public. While they failed to anticipate that Hitler would launch a total war and industrial-scale genocide, they did consider him a buffoon. Hitler, in their eyes, was not a serious man, unfit to govern, a classless buffoon. His appeal, the German elite believed, came from his outsider status, which allowed him to posture against the political system and make extravagant promises to his followers that would never be tested against reality. What‚Äôs more, Hitler‚Äôs explicit contempt for democracy made even the authoritarian German right nervous about entrusting him with power. But traditional conservatives willingly handed power to a figure so dangerous that he threatened their own political and economic interests because they believed they can control him. German conservatives did not see Hitler as Hitler ‚Äî they saw Hitler as American conservative see Trump. Just like the Republican elites like Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnel and others  accept Trump today, German conservatives accepted Hitler believing the responsibility of governing would tame Hitler, and that his beliefs were amorphous and could be shaped by advisers once in office. They respected his populist appeal and believed it could serve their own ends. By accepting Trump, GOP leaders put party before country. And it is so sad! The founding fathers create a system of checks and balances and separation of powers. But the orange dangerous demagogue has shown he has zero respect for that system over and over again, and the self serving, spineless coward Republican elites have shown zero interest in defending the system and to stand up to that demagogue. So I have zero faith those republican leaders will be the check and balance if they still control congress and the orange piece of garbage wins the presidency. And that should terrify everyone. How are they gonna stand up to a guy when he is a president and have all the powers when the spineless cowards can't stand up to him when he is just a loudmouthed candidate? Let's hope history doesn't repeat itself. One thing is for sure even if the orange garbage loses, the forces that created him will linger. As a country, especially the Republican Party need to have an honest discussion about how a temperamentally, emotionally, and intellectually unfit, narcissistic, con artist came so close to the presidency starting November 9th, if we smart enough to avoid his presidency. Remember: History has shown us fascism arrives as your friend, your savior, your true leader. It promises to restore honor, country pride, to protect you from all invented enemies, to give you jobs, and to clean up neighborhoods. Fascism arrives reminding you how great your country once were and promises to remove anything you feel is unlike you, blame all country's troubles on a single targeted group. Fascism comes to power and popularity by arousing the emotions, passions, and prejudices of the people. By fear and hate mongering!!!! Early warning signs of Fascism shouldn't be ignored! "When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross."

So far in the current election cycle, a record $14 million in independent money has been spent on television advertisements for state supreme court seats.

1 | Angie Quinn | 7 | 10154723086518675_10154723450618675 | "...as more ads air during judicial campaigns, the less likely state justices are to side with defendants during criminal appeals. That could be because sitting justices are worried about being attacked for those decisions during their next race. It raises real questions about due process and how people are being treated.‚Äù....#justiceforsale
2 | Jacob Lucas | 12 | 10154723086518675_10154723409478675 | Remember when the United States had nine sitting SCOTUS members? Pepperidge farm remebers.

5 | Lidia Rocco | 0 | 10154723086518675_10154724642778675 | Of course, bribery for important factors !That is to say, corruption in which state institutions do not work on any ethical code!

10 | Mindy Wirick | 1 | 10154723086518675_10154723619548675 | The campaigning should not run more than 9 weeks
11 | Kevin Spalding | 1 | 10154723086518675_10154723459083675 | This has to stop.
12 | Jonne Warner | 1 | 10154723086518675_10154723698203675 | The only thing that comes to mind is how much good that money could have done if spent in any local inner city school.   Sigh.....

"I knew I couldn't write about baseball as tragedy because of course it's not real tragedy. But when your team loses, it feels like tragedy."

2 | Lenny Mack | 0 | 10154723085223675_10154724475683675 | People denigrate baseball. It's time-consuming & one needs to absorb a great deal of folklore about the game. Still, it is a fascinating enriching sport, tasked both by individual & team exploits.
3 | Daniel Gaskell | 0 | 10154723085223675_10154725779908675 | Baseball is not life...sports should enrich if you identify with a team...but this should be an indicator that something better is missing....
4 | Lidia Rocco | 0 | 10154723085223675_10154724645063675 | This is a game where one throws a small ball, the other with a stick trying to hit the ball , rest of others are just  running around.That's it !

Do you really want the nightmare to continue?Today marks the starting date for Obamacare open enrollment.Hussein Obama openly enrolled in destroying one sixth of our economy. State by state, individuals and families are suffering.That's not federal numbers, folks, that's human beings, our fellow citizens, who need medical care.....Destroyed. Not one Republican voted for the passage of the ACA mess.Every Republican - and every wise citizen - should vote for our Nominee, Donald Trump.Otherwise, this abject disaster, this destoryer of life, continues.....https://www.facebook.com/475549362567960/videos/1009895302466694/?pnref=story

"How should I present my lack of formal education, as I am sure it will be used against me in salary negotiations?"

We can not simply consume, we need to produce and need to fix the trade deals to bring the jobs back and get the great United States working again!

The way you work this is by waiting for the initial offer, then negotiate from there.  The candidate should focus on communicating strengths and experience when education is lacking.
