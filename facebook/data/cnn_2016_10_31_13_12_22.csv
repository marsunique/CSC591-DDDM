There's already proof that babies are living things, and that they should be given the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness like everyone else! I mean trump is a fetus, and he's still here, Oh wait a minute I take that back, that comparison only makes people to want to abort more! Ha Ha ;)

She just can‚Äôt get a break. Remember how she and her husband left the White House flat broke? I bet she thought she could keep her doctor if she liked her doctor too. Why, they‚Äôve had to work real hard to make ends meet between giving speeches for $250,000 or more and all the charity work at the Foundation. I've heard Haiti loves the Clintons. Anyway, it‚Äôs just tough being Hillary - named after that famous mountain climber, you know. But really, folks, at this point what difference does it make? She‚Äôs admitted to not being technically gifted. She tried wiping her server with a cloth, what more can we ask of her? It‚Äôs not like anyone died under her watch, right?

She is a criminal, corrupt, money hungry, power driven, look down at all the people, pathological liar. Who surrounds herself with corrupt people that will help her do her work. Like Obama, Loretta Lynch, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Huma Abedin , congressman Anthony Weiner! Liar liar pants suit on fire!
20 | Debra MacDonald | 1 | 10155536420021509_1092631507525089 | CNN you are trying to bury the fact that Hillary Clinton did not turn over 650,000 emails now found on Weiner's computer. I just reviewed your feed and it is filled with FBI and Trump bashing. You loved Comey in July and now he's crooked. Please just report the news not your one sided opinions.
21 | Carole Kraushaar Agopsowicz | 3 | 10155536420021509_10155536461676509 | Another bigly falsehood from Trump......how does he get away with all these lies?......Where is responsible, credible journalism?
22 | Jimmy Cooper | 2 | 10155536420021509_10155536453771509 | any word from CNN about Aunt Jamima Brazile feeding the lady with a rash from flint michigan question to hillary clinton??????  thats right, nothing. and thats what the ratings are, nothing.
23 | Deborah Jean | 1 | 10155536420021509_1092640030857570 | You mean, Clinton emails threaten national security, Trump using foul language in s locker room. Clinton emails lying about using private server for work emails, Trump using profound language in a lockeroom. Trump calling to work with Putin to destroy Isis, Hilliary selling Russia 20% of our uranium while Secretary of State, and then receiving a huge donation through the Clinton foundation. Sorry, I stopped reading after this because, you discredited yourself with your own stupidity.
24 | Melissa Burnham | 2 | 10155536420021509_1797199937234016 | If Trump wins, he will not have the support of Congress, neither Democrats or Republicans. He will not have the power or authority to do anything he's promised. We'll just be at a stalemate for four years, barring his impeachment. He thinks he would be elected king, or dictator, because he doesn't understand how our three branches of government work. He doesn't understand our constitution. He doesn't have knowledge of other countries. It will be disappointing, but I believe we will survive. He will not be elected for a second term. My opinion.
25 | James Kennedy | 0 | 10155536420021509_1788447174763400 | I wish CNN would release a news story on Donna Brazile and her misuse of debate questions while a news correspondent for CNN. Is this something we should be worried about with CNN now and in the future? I recall the denials being made that she would access to such questions, is CNN being truthful? Did the Hillary campaign inform their candidate about these questions prior to the debate? If so, did the candidate use that information to her advantage and cheat? Gary Johnson for President 2016

A man jumped a fence at a zoo in China to meet a panda. But the encounter was far from friendly. http://cnn.it/2eMxill

3 | Daniel Beal | 63 | 10155536079126509_10155536297046509 | This is too painful to watch. If only Harambe had been in a Chinese zoo.
4 | Danny Bell | 16 | 10155536079126509_10155536153881509 | Don't you have any integrity?  I watched you guys cover all of the Trump protestors, and now we know they were paid to incite violence yet you don't cover an African American getting assaulted on camera for protecting the Trump star! How do you guys sleep at night!

6 | Jack Tao | 2 | 10155536079126509_10155536422671509 | Wikileaks is exposing how biased and disgusting a news organization that you really are. Donna Brazil telling the clinton campaign the questions at your town hall. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Where are your morals? Oh, I forgot,  your progressive liberal democrats,  you don't have any.  You make  me want to vomit.
7 | McEden Wangang | 0 | 10155536079126509_10155536705146509 | Did you get the wickedness of man into another? These guys said they organised a medical checkup for the panda and put it under observation. Then nothing for the man. He said, "He should be OK". That's all. Chai
8 | Rebecca Daugherty | 3 | 10155536079126509_10155536558681509 | The panda at the end eating his food is too much. This guy thought he could just enter his habitat well he had another thing coming. üêº

10 | Eric Mason | 0 | 10155536079126509_10155536673291509 | I was reading today that Pandas are one of those animals that seem cute and cuddly but on the low they are viciuous as hell. Pandas and bottle nosed dolphins. #Beware
11 | Dean Felix | 0 | 10155536079126509_10155536595801509 | For those of you who wonder why so many of us are voting for Trump- I think this sums it up pretty good! For What It's Worth Department:                                        The Media just doesn‚Äôt get it....they can't believe that people are so angry     that they can no longer be manipulated!  Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes, he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phony pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and it's going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.
12 | Ricky Moore | 1 | 10155536079126509_10155536554346509 | The Panda might have just been playing with him.the problem is they are so big and strong they can kill a human and just be playing like they do with other Panda's.
13 | Aaron Hoyne | 3 | 10155536079126509_10155536386226509 | This guy may be dumb, but would he be dumb enough to continue to support a candidate that has no experience and is a bigot? Would he been dumb enough to support the other candidate with all the corruption and lies? My guess is he wouldn't, so just remeber when you vote on the 8th, you're just as dumb as a man that jumped a fence at zoo unless you vote third party.
14 | Jade Maier | 0 | 10155536079126509_10155536603121509 | I liked that he started petting the panda when it had a body hold on him. You know that guy was thinking "Let me go, let me get out of here." üòÇ
15 | Andrew Sepulveda | 0 | 10155536079126509_10155536697776509 | The panda looks cute, but,  it's still a bear. A bear that eats bamboo,  but it's still a bear and bears are strong and are known to kill people. It was pushing him around like a rag doll.
16 | Tiffany Moyes | 1 | 10155536079126509_10155536664786509 | Tony Lor, Emily Weber, we should be concerned for John Nicolini. Who knows the lengths he'll go to hang out with pandas.

18 | Barry Toland | 0 | 10155536079126509_10155536702926509 | That guy should be thrown in jail and barred from the zoo for life. His early voting ballot should be disqualified. He should do 2080 hours of community service.These millenials think they can do as they please.

2 | Brian Beech | 205 | 10155535252116509_10155535269496509 | Good for him if he has 9 million to spend on what he wants. However the amount of good he could have done with 9 million dollars is amazing, could have helped so many people out
3 | Mohammed Ibrahim | 92 | 10155535252116509_10155535284381509 | I believe in charity, humility and modesty for the most part. More importantly, i believe in people's rights to spend their money how they want, the same people judging this man will hate to be judged on how much they spend on booze, cigarettes, shoes, cars. I also love the first ammendment, so keep up with the hating.
4 | Dale Hubbard | 55 | 10155535252116509_10155535294006509 | Everyone of you commenting on him spending to much on plates obviously didn't read the article. He said because UAE does not have income tax he sees it as a way to give back to his government.

8 | Rhonda Cain Diamond | 8 | 10155535252116509_10155535313461509 | Yes this sounds ridiculous and yes I'm sure there are better things that can be done with 18 million dollars. But it is his money and he can choose to spend it however he wants. I believe in modesty charity and Humanity for the most part and I also believe in people's rights to spend their money however they choose. I'm sure people are judging me by spending 20 bucks on a costume for my dog. But the truth is I work hard for my money and nobody can tell me how to spend it as long as I pay taxes LOL.

10 | Tanya Villanueva | 1 | 10155535252116509_10155536598766509 | Since you have money to waste on license plates... have you even once considered donating money to the poor who genuinely need help. Yeah right... I doubt it! Give me some of the money you seem to enjoy wasting. Believe me... I won't frivolously waste it like you do

13 | Mauricio Longhini | 1 | 10155535252116509_10155536497401509 | CHOCOLATE CAKE1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder, plus more for dusting 1 1/2 teaspoons salt3 cups all-purpose flour1 tablespoon baking soda3/4 cup vegetable oil1 1/2 cups buttermilk3 cups sugar1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder3 large eggs, lightly beaten1 1/2 cups hot waterDIRECTIONSTRY THESE VARIATIONS -- THEY'RE A PIECE OF CAKEPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter cake pans. Line bottoms with parchment paper, and butter paper. Dust the pans with cocoa; tap out extra. Sift cocoa, flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and sugar into bowl. Beat in oil, buttermilk, vanilla, eggs, and hot water one at a time, using a mixer set at low. Beat until smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into pans. Bake 45 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean; rotate the pans halfway through and remove cakes from the oven. Let cakes cool in pans on wire racks, 20 minutes, before inverting to remove. Discard paper. Cool completely on racks, top side up. Cut off top of one layer. With a butter knife, frost top of trimmed layer. Place the other layer on top. Frost top and sides of cake. Tiny and Tasty: Cupcakes are great for parties at school -- they require no cutting, and liners come in all different sizes and designs. After you make the chocolate-cake batter, fill each liner so it's three-quarters full. Our recipe will yield about 30 standard-size cupcakes; bake at 350 degrees for 40 to 45 minutes (25 to 35 minutes for mini sizes). Once cool, cover them with your favorite frosting. Bars with Crunch: Instead of using frosting, sprinkle topping over chocolate squares. Pour cake batter into a 9-by-13-inch prepared baking pan, and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Mix 1 cup each flaked sweetened coconut, walnuts, and semisweet chocolate chips; stir in 1 tablespoon melted butter. Remove cake from oven; sprinkle mix on top. Loosely cover with foil; continue baking, about 45 minutes.

He says he believes the money will go to charity and toward improving the city's infrastructure."I believe in giving back," he said. "This city has given me a lot."
15 | Omarr Syed | 0 | 10155535252116509_10155536441751509 | People who are bashing how he could have helped the needy instead of wasting it on a number plate are the same ones who would not think twice before spending 50 bucks on something they don't "need". How about instead of wasting those $50, donate it to the people in need? Do something with whatever extra you have before start bashing others. Set an example. It is not responsibility of the millionaires only to help poor people. I just don't see how it makes a $50000 guy wasting $50 any different than the $100 million guy wasting $9 million.

We can have republicans in the house i dont care. but for president Hillary is the only one that actually respects the democratic process that alone is the biggest reason to vote for her.

In Africa, your parents are your guide, even when you leave home and start up your own family. You never outgrow the wisdom of your parents. NEVER.

3 | John Phillip | 427 | 10155534941221509_10155534950711509 | Why is it that Hillary says "I used bad judgement, I certainly won't do it again, and I accept full responsibility", but when it comes to accepting responsibility she blames the fbi. When her husband assaults women, she blames the women for speaking out. When the Wikileaks dumps come out she blames the Russians for hacking the emails.

21 | Cory Predmore | 30 | 10155534941221509_10155534996831509 | Nice try asshats.... Comey is not supporting any candidate. A criminal investigation is completely justified....What is not justified however, is that Hillary isn't standing trial for her crimes, they got swept under the rug... She is not allowed to be president given the laws she broke. She is no longer eligible...  Yet the white house is protecting her.
22 | Justin Cornelius | 21 | 10155534941221509_10155534965446509 | This is worse than your usual bias. This is outright dangerous.

23 | Derek Raymond | 12 | 10155534941221509_10155535088096509 | So in July Democrats stated "Comey is a great man" , In July Comey told congress he would keep them updated if new eveidence comes to light. In Oct Comey informs congress of new information like he promised, In Oct Democrats decide Comey is a terrible person. Holy hypocrites.

1 | CNN | 27 | 10155534811211509_10155534832611509 | Everything you need to know about the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server  http://cnn.it/2e4PIJY
2 | Eric Edward | 411 | 10155534811211509_10155534817746509 | This guy ran the fast and furious program and he wants to talk about breach ? Shut up with your whole corrupt group that the FBI should have brought down long long ago
3 | Diego Hinojosa | 326 | 10155534811211509_10155534817231509 | Breach of protocol, you must be kidding, Hillary Clinton is a fugitive from justice. Stop trying to cover up the truth and lock her up. She is abundantly guilty of crimes against the people of the United States of America. Obama and Clinton are the shame of our nation and a dam disgrace.
4 | Gene Hamilton | 187 | 10155534811211509_10155534828936509 | They are ripping Comey but I don't hear anyone asking, what are thousands of emails from Hillary doing on a device Huma says she hardly used and claims it is Wieners?
5 | Sandie Francisco | 162 | 10155534811211509_10155534836811509 | BS! You CNN Need to start reporting the truth about this now!!!! They have the warrant, there IS e mails from Hillary Clinton's private e mail account and the government!!! She needs to step down!!!!!
6 | Butch Betts | 92 | 10155534811211509_10155534830796509 | I'm sure the news of the investigation being reopened is heart breaking for some but the truth is the only person to blame is Hillary for making this mess. If she had not been working outside proper guidelines, for whatever reason you may come up with, NONE of this would be happening.
7 | Marcella Giordano | 61 | 10155534811211509_10155534829526509 | the clintons know there is evidence of raketeering within the clinton foundation and FBI agents have threatened to leak this information to the press. this is why the clintons moved the clinton foundation fortune to Qatar this month, a country with no US extradition agreement. the DOJ blocked every attempt at a clinton foundation investigation in spite of overwhelming evidence to protect the clintons. there is mutany at the FBI because of the rampant corruption within the DOJ and Comey.
8 | Mike Miller | 25 | 10155534811211509_10155534876821509 | Eric!! My man. The only reason you are not in jail is thanks to an executive order from your boss. Maybe you should just keep quiet, go on pension and stop wasting your breath.
9 | Hilda Pearl | 34 | 10155534811211509_10155534835001509 | Well, these people are so determined to incriminate Hillary to the point of jeopardizing their own freedom! While Trump is inciting criminal activity, he is smart enough not to do the dirty work himself! And in the end, it'll be all for nothing! Wake up people, Trump is always for himself! Like he said, if he loses, it'll be a terrible waste of time and money!
10 | Puneet Verma | 14 | 10155534811211509_10155534856841509 | Wow, CNN in FULL DAMAGE CONTROL. It wasn't a breach of Protocol when Bill Clinton did it to Bush Sr. in 1992 and Comey wasn't a Republican hack in July when he emphasized the misconduct of Hillary and didn't indict her. Hypocrisy would be an understatement.
11 | Jeff Shoemaker | 26 | 10155534811211509_10155534869486509 | Democrats loved James Comey July 5th when he said he wouldn't recommend formal charges... Now there is a compete 180 degree flip flop. Hillary destroyed 33,000 emails and lied to the FBI and American people. 8 days from the election and there is only one person to blame for these problems...Hillary Clinton...
12 | Abyson Simon | 12 | 10155534811211509_10155534863701509 | Eric Holder "disagrees" ??? You must be kidding me, he was in charge of the fast and the furious program. You sir need to be prosecuted for criminal mischief and manslaughter charges.
13 | Mark Laible | 13 | 10155534811211509_10155534851116509 | It's pretty bad for CNN when all the people commenting on their bias liberal posts on social media are trashing them for how one sided their coverage is.
14 | Gregory Vance | 10 | 10155534811211509_1836725779906117 | Isn't Eric Holder STILL in contempt of congress for refusing to testify about his and Hussein's schemes to traffic firearms to narco terrorist drug cartels in Mexico?This guy should probably just sit down and shut up.
15 | Favour Johnson Destiny | 16 | 10155534811211509_10155534834216509 | I want reasonable people to put on their thinking caps and ask a simple question, why is the email issue coming up again in less than 2 weeks to the election? .
16 | Kody Morrell | 13 | 10155534811211509_10155534870396509 | Coming from Holder? Who was as corrupt as the come? Oh, please...not a good spokesman for ethics right there. Is so funny that Democrats keep trying to spin this as, oh...how DARE Comey prosecute Hillary Clinton for breakimg the LAW and LYING to the American People AND the FBI about it, is just laughable to say the least. What is truly scary here is how politicians are ATTACKING a Law Enforcement professional for doing his job. A CNN reporter over the weekend actually said he could just not said she under investigation even tho she IS. We have a right to know who we are voting for, and this effort to cover up and suppress information about her is a terrifying precedent you are setting. She has no,one to blame BUT HERSELF.
17 | Roy Burnett | 6 | 10155534811211509_10155534859156509 | Americans know the Clinton team actively seeks out people to condemn/punish anyone who exposes Bill or Hillary's corruption, so this is no different.
18 | Julie Bursic | 14 | 10155534811211509_10155534835371509 | Former AG Eric Holder ...with all due respect, based on your track record, if you told me it's very sunny outdoors and to bring my sunglasses ---SIR, I AM BRINGING THE BIGEST, BADEST FLASHLIGHT I OWN because I can't trust you all and it's probably pitch dark outside. You Sir are part of the problem.
19 | Mike Lynn Hosler | 15 | 10155534811211509_10155534846176509 | Dems and Media in full spin mode, the Russians did it? Watch in the next 9 days how dirty and corrupt the Media and their Boss Hillary become.... If Hillary can pay $1500 per thug to disrupt Trump events (info from Wikileak e-mail dump) than nothing will surprise us now.
20 | Jeff Robins | 8 | 10155534811211509_10155534900606509 | Maybe Holder should have given Lynch advice about not getting together on a plane with the husband of a woman who was under investigation so that she wouldn't have had to defer her job responsibilities in the first place.
21 | Arthur Hohn | 35 | 10155534811211509_10155534813991509 | Hey Hillary, how does it feel to be aborted TEN DAYS before delivery???>?
22 | Moji Hoss | 15 | 10155534811211509_10155534833251509 | FBI is Re-opening the Hillary File My last name is "Itold you so".This announcement by Mr. Comey is purely political announcement, 100%, no doubt. Never. Ever, FBI would drop a bomb on election, because of purely uncertain situation that may or may not be serious;  Director, James B. Comey: ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.‚Äô‚Äô & "The FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant," Director Comey has a responsibility in this situation to say, okay my deputies that find all this information on Weiner‚Äôs computer, I have to study this information carefully ‚Äúmyself‚Äù before I could make any decision on them, and therefore could take his time till after the election for any correct decision making.I think President Obama should respond to his political move by his FBI Director very Forcefully and very Quickly.
23 | Angel Hughes Jackson | 2 | 10155534811211509_10155534953751509 | Funny how they didn't raise this stink before. But if you watched this like I did then you know that this would be the head of the DOJ to do this but wait because she got caught on the tarmac with Bill she recused herself. But isn't it funny that she wouldn't allow a warrant until 2 weeks later when the FBI commented that they wouldn't allow it! I pray for this country.  Today either your completely blinded by your Hillary democrat hold or you realize that the establishment does have care more about themselves then us.
24 | Janice Drake | 4 | 10155534811211509_10155534886976509 | How many of you know that when politicians say they will tax billionaire's salaries they know those folks don't take "salaries" anymore their money is already hidden in blind trusts that can't be taxed laughs on us it is the middle class working stiff gonna get the tax. The really big tax increase right now is Obamacare which billionaire is paying this tax ? None !!! Remember the Supreme Court changed the language of the law to read tax so it could be implemented
25 | Shane Snyder | 7 | 10155534811211509_10155534901276509 | "The best thing would be for Democrats to ask her to step down now. It would be the most responsible thing to do, if the nation were more important to them than power. And the American news media ‚Äî fairly or not firmly identified in the public mind as Mrs. Clinton's political action committee ‚Äî should begin demanding it."http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/kass/ct-hillary-clinton-emails-kass-1030-20161028-column.html

The Justice Department has now obtained a warrant to begin searching the computer believed to contain thousands of newly found emails of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin

1 | Keith Mahorney | 762 | 10155534716706509_10155534730736509 | There is no one else who could have survived all the repercussions from past like Hillary has. That has changed and it will come out eventually.  My hope is that all this corruption gets exposed for what it is. The Clinton's are masters of manipulation and think they are above the law. Wikileaks has opened this up for all to see.
2 | Keyo Wilson | 613 | 10155534716706509_10155534720201509 | Let's get this over with, please?And Trump hasn't released his taxes, but who's paying attention?
3 | Robert Hamil | 438 | 10155534716706509_10155534740016509 | There is so much the media is NOT telling the people about this! ATTENTION the FBI would not reopen a closed case unless there is some damaging evidence in these emails. Pay attention people!
4 | Gus Tzorzis | 314 | 10155534716706509_10155534733066509 | I don't like Hillary because she is corrupt!!!Trump has upcoming fraud and child rape trials. Trump tried to do business in Cuba during an embargo. Trump used his charity's money to buy a portrait of himself and pay fines. Trump lied about donating to veterans and 9/11 charities. Trump stiffed sub-contractors out of payment. Trump used illegal Polish immigrants to build Trump Tower. Trump was sued for not renting to black people. Trump "Donated" $25,000 to Florida's Attorney General causing her to drop the investigation into Trump University.Trump bragged about sexual assault. Trump left the State of NJ with an unpaid $25 million tax bill. Trump was found guilty of creating a fake anti-gambling front organization to slander Native American casino competition. Trump has been repeatedly fined for breaking rules related to his operation of casinos. Trump was fined $750,000 by the FTC for failing to disclose his purchases of stock in two companies.The hypocrisy of Trump supporters is too funny and too sad at the same time.
5 | Darby N Lan Dell | 309 | 10155534716706509_10155534750456509 | See this is what happens when people disobey Clinton. She ordered everyone to destroy their electronics with a hammer. She said no evidence, no crime.
6 | Marcella Giordano | 263 | 10155534716706509_10155534721556509 | FBI field offices in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and Little Rock, Ark., are investigating the Clinton Foundation concerning allegations of pay-to-play financial and political corruption, according to a report at The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Sunday.Read more: http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/30/now-five-fbi-field-offices-are-probing-clinton-charity-adding-fuel-to-the-fire/#ixzz4OfCC3LPg
7 | Frank Kwame Amoako-Atta II | 193 | 10155534716706509_10155534740601509 | Up until 5 days ago, Trump and his supporters were saying the FBI and Comey were in Clinton's and Obama's hands and that the election was rigged. Now they are saying Comey is the best thing since sliced bread. They always want it both ways. Sexual misconduct is okay when it's directed at Bill, but is hearsay and lies when directed at Trump. They want transparency from Hillary by insisting she disclose speech transcripts, but Trump gets a pass for not releasing his tax returns. They point to the Clinton foundation as being corrupt while ignoring Trump using his charity to pay off state attorney generals to not file charges against Trump Looniversity...and on and on
8 | Christine Simonette | 191 | 10155534716706509_10155534723426509 | My biggest question, if wikileaks and the FBI went after trump like they are Hillary, what would they find?
9 | Maritza Polanko | 60 | 10155534716706509_10155534731476509 | I really want to understand the Hillary email case...in my opinion as small business with technology any one can be victim of scanned emails...Hillary was one...Please forget Hillary email it is not sense at all.
10 | Scott Geer | 673 | 10155534716706509_10155534731251509 | Hillary and Huma knows what is in the emails, they just didn't anticipate them being found.  Prison bars are STRONGER closer TOGETHER ladies.  #LockHerUpThisTime  #JusticeTrumpsCrooks
11 | Paulette Koss | 51 | 10155534716706509_10155534785381509 | I agree with Christine. Trump has been protected as a private citizen. He hasn't even released taxes. If the FBI went after him, they would find a lot worse. This is a witch hunt by a Repub FBI director to disrupt elections. Nice try!
12 | Tony Norest | 26 | 10155534716706509_10155534760401509 | This was the worst thing rep could of done ... now I'm fully supporting  hillary before I was on the fence. .. now it just looks like they are picking on her and being a bully . This would only put fire in her base like it did to me.  This while campaign they been getting at hillary for most of what other people have done ....I done I'm going to vote tomorrow I'm not waiting, at this point " she can shoot someone died in the middle of 5st and won't lose my vote "     .. and you can take that to the bank.

15 | Tiffany Michelle Sullivan Gharbi | 20 | 10155534716706509_10155534887421509 | And Trump goes on trial next month for fraud in Trump University and then in December for the rape of a 13 year old.  Honestly, I would rather have a president who has issues with emails than a pedophile. Just saying.
16 | Andy Foreman | 25 | 10155534716706509_10155534764816509 | This is the problem I'm having with this whole situation. I have heard that FBI DIRECTOR James Comey has been sitting on this information for a while.To me that suggests that he had time to review it and file all the papers necessary to present it.Now if that is true why is he releasing it now and doesn't know what pertinent information it contains, if any?Something is very strange about this whole situation. What all of a sudden was his rush to get this unchecked or previously checked information out? Was it to plant a seed of doubt in the Clinton campaign ahead of the early voting?Yeah that's it.
17 | Munziba Khan | 0 | 10155534716706509_668620703316438 | Listen, this is what's going on. These are found in Huma and Anthony's computer with nothing coming from Hillary. Remember, Hillary is asking for Comey to release everything that says something about how confident she is about the emails and how the emails. On the other hand, Trump says he'll sue the accusers, and his wife says they will be judged in the court of law, while calling Hillary an enabler. He refuses to release his tax return that shows they has so many things to hide. He has given to charity in a decade. A man who has ties to Russia, is Putin's puppet, and is not given anything to charity, and scared of the women accused him of assault. Remember, he said he will sue NY times and when NY times said they are happy because then he has to testify under oath, he backed off. Hillary is not afraid of the email question. Finally, he has been talking about rigged election and voter fraud when it is his supporter getting arrested for voting twice in Iowa. What he says Hillary will bring 650 million illegal immigrants in one week to US. This is the guy people want to vote for? Trump is a coward and nothing else and he encourage the rigging of system. So just get out in record number and vote BLUE and make sure that this idiots and his minions don't get anywhere near the WH and congress.
18 | Johnny Graslee | 5 | 10155534716706509_1244490662238018 | Imagine that. The email files stored on Huma Abedin's laptop is labeled "Life Insurance." NYPD found 10,000 emails in it. Is it possible Abedin saved these emails as insurance? In case Hillary Clinton decides to throw her under the bus?
19 | John Howard | 19 | 10155534716706509_10155534764761509 | Forget about the corruption , at the very least her negligence pertaining to classified information should preclude her from ever having a security clearance or hold federal office again.
20 | Patricia Haidvogel | 15 | 10155534716706509_1865371807082536 | At this point, I wouldn't care whether there are new emails or not. For all we know, they could be duplicates of the same emails already looked into. FBI director doesn't know what is in them but he was perfectly willing to interfere in the election before even obtaining a warrant. This won't sway me. Not when the alternative is Donald Trump who has some huge skeletons in his closet himself. Voting blue down the ballot because I'm tired of the do nothing and complain about everything attitude. Republicans complain over everything, but they have been in control of most offices for several years now. Their hands are all over the steering wheel.
21 | Marie Wellens | 14 | 10155534716706509_10155534864211509 | Oh bullcrap. Trump writes a check for 10 million , supposedly a donation & low & behold, the FBI is investigating more e-mails. Give it a rest, as a matter of fact just put it 6 feet under becase if Trump thinks this is going to make people forget about the crap he has pulled, is still pulling & the way he treats people in this country, he's got another thing coming.
22 | Carol Skelley Angstrom | 8 | 10155534716706509_10155534812536509 | If a person is willing to take down anyone who stands in his way of getting what he wants is not my idea of presidential material. Why does this man and I use the term Loosely, hate everyone and everything except himself on this planet? He also brags about the tremendous effort he is making and add the lack there of of Hillary's efforts. He talks about his grueling schedule, OMG, he flies around from here to there in the lap of luck Sharee with his own bedroom goldplated shower, I feel so sorry for him oh how exhausting it must be to have people kissing your feet 24 seven. Especially all of those yes men and women he has surrounding him. It is sad to know that there are so many people with no morals whatsoever, Who will follow a man like this and do his bidding. And Donald wants us to do his bidding, I for one will not

Hell with taxes! Nothin in his taxes changes ANYTHING! Her emails change EVERYTHING! Get your priorities together.
24 | Anne Ross Knoeller | 2 | 10155534716706509_668593459985829 | I dont understand why people arent fired up over Trumps upcoming FEDERAL fraud court case. In my book fraud is a big deal. These were everyday people trying to get ahead....
25 | Bob Adams | 2 | 10155534716706509_10155534896336509 | As long as CNN and the main stream media continue to be subjective propaganda instead of objective news the Democrats will be slow to change their negative behavior.

3 | Randy Wilson | 7 | 10155534651126509_10155534690566509 | Lol@ Tiana Minard, it has nothing to do with strong women, her past criminal activity, lying to the FBI in sworn statements, destroying evidence under soebpena, lying to Congress, all crimes in and of themselves that make her ineligible to run to start with. Add to that the fact she can no longer get even the most basic, classified, security clearance, according to the oversight committee. Along with the Clinton foundation now under FBI investigation, her aides ties to Saudi Arabia, terrorist groups, national security issues, and now even MORE leaked videos released today of her campaign caught red handed AGAIN attempting to rig the election, but, doesn't matter, I'm sure your have no intention of voting for a " strong intelligent, lol, woman" more like, your voting for what she has between her legs and that's the only reason. And I have to ask, if she's SO INTELLIGENT, how are all her dirty little secrets coming to light over the last several years? As for this article, we better be cleaning up our act, taking better care of this planet, or who's crooked, who's not, who's elected, who's not won't matter in a few decades anyway

2 | Scott Arend | 1433 | 10155534561261509_10155534567506509 | The irony of CNN pretending to care about facts. HA

5 | Chris Kabel | 459 | 10155534561261509_10155534570216509 | LMAO the Clinton News Network runs more fake and bias "news" than any other outlet there is! You're ever worse the Faux News now!!! #Liberalbiasmedia
6 | Robert Leslie | 224 | 10155534561261509_10155534591726509 | If there is one area where CNN has expertise it's "fake news".   The Clinton News Network is biased garbage all day everyday.

12 | Matthew Kirby Johnson | 46 | 10155534561261509_10155534688701509 | CNN, your still a joke. You're one of the news outlets that is biased and don't tell it like it is. You sugar coat it to fit your narrative. We don't trust your site at all. Figures you'd say and do something like this. Still a joke
13 | Carol Morgan DiPirro | 53 | 10155534561261509_10155534604396509 | Well if CNN stayed reliable and didn't filter news like not covering the standoff between militarized police and water protectors in North Dakota before now we wouldn't have to go looking for other sources. Small real outfits have been covering it since April. We'll trust you more if you share the news without an opinion. What happened to Who, what , whey, how and not taking sides?
14 | Marci Waltemate | 22 | 10155534561261509_10155534604836509 | Breaking news is rarely accurate. Try not to form a rigid opinion right away. The Economist is one of the least unbiased news sources or basically anything not American. The BBC is pretty great. The deal is, though they don't report the American drama. Too many of my countrymen and women are hungry for the click bait. They don't want to read about the Indonesian drug problem. They want the next dirt on their presidential candidates. Kind of sad.
15 | Alain Garcia | 38 | 10155534561261509_10155534683881509 | Wow CNN Clinton News Network is the first plague on facebook, I think they are realizing nobody trusts them anymore and want to impose a media dictatorship.
16 | Bryan Williams | 29 | 10155534561261509_10155534614331509 | CNN, you should do your own research into WHERE these fake news sites are from!  Snopes and a few other sites found that this rash of new fake news sites were created by DEMOCRATS this year to trick some na√Øve Republicans into sharing them so that they could be ridiculed after-the-fact.
17 | Christopher J Foster | 41 | 10155534561261509_10155534596876509 | Out of the entire public that regularly watches CNN only 5% believe their BS. And those 5% are sad little souls who need help. I used to respect CNN keyword USED to but over the years they have become a total propaganda machine which directly and negatively corrupts our very democracy itself
18 | David Barlaam | 19 | 10155534561261509_10155534619916509 | Actually Maria Bartiromo was on Fox yesterday morning... And in 5th place on twitter was something to the affect of "Did Jim Comey do something bad" - but no mention of it in 1-4. So even CNN is parsing the truth here, doing exactly what they are excoriating others for doing.
19 | Judi Wilson | 7 | 10155534561261509_1464590530223339 | Based on my knowledge of the word fact, I have found CNN to be one of the most impartial of the reporting stations.  I personally only repost stuff I have seen and heard personally or articles published by REPUTABLE sources.  I think that the majority of those condemning CNN get their news from alt right or alt left sources.
20 | Debra Debra | 8 | 10155534561261509_10155534657301509 | This is fake and anyone who has listened to trump knows every word out of his mouth is a lie.Dont believe anything he says.I will be glad when this election is over and we get our dignity back.

22 | David T. Ong | 6 | 10155534561261509_10155534710291509 | There is so much fake news about the US election especially from supporters of Donald Trump and pro Trump newscasters that one cannot tell the truth from the fake news anymore. I am sure many of the American voters are convinced of them. CNN is actually a better reporting site!
23 | Mark Black | 25 | 10155534561261509_10155534581281509 | I heard Trump caused the death of four USA Marines in Benghazi, and then lied about it. That's why I'm voting Hillary Clinton. We can't have a lying killer in the White House.
24 | George A. Daughtry | 5 | 10155534561261509_1464707770211615 | The deplorables will fall for the okie doke every time due to their constant watching of faux news.  They believe Shawn Hannity and Bill O are newscasters....SMH the less educated. The dumbing down of America
25 | Kevin Farley | 2 | 10155534561261509_1464691996879859 | After manufacturing Trump's candidacy, it's a bit late for the media to be warning about "fake news".

The male birth control shot worked -- but the study was ended because of side effects like depression and acne.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Randy Bishop | 2622 | 10155534483396509_10155534487386509 | Aren't those the same side effects of women's birth control?
2 | Pam Harris | 1846 | 10155534483396509_10155534484721509 | Women's birth control also has side effects but we deal with it!
3 | James Ryan DiBlasi | 1185 | 10155534483396509_10155534498411509 | So depression and acne lead to the termination of a study but we advertise drugs on tv that cause heart attack, stroke, cancer, birth defects, and alien abductions?
4 | Julia Brown | 922 | 10155534483396509_10155534503611509 | So we women have to deal with changes in menstrual periods, irregular menstrual periods, mood changes,breast tenderness or pain,abdominal pain, back pain,changes in appetite, nausea, acne, weakness, headache, depression,vaginal infection or inflammation,vaginal discharge... Etc. These are real side effects for Nexplanon but men shouldn't have those problems with their birth control. Oh okay. üôÑüôÑüôÑ
5 | Tasha Wright | 594 | 10155534483396509_10155534487336509 | All women's birth control has side effects. Poor men just can't handle it.
6 | Emily Henderson | 337 | 10155534483396509_10155534486411509 | I want to feel sorry for these guys. But I so totally don't. And while it's obvious that this particular treatment has side effects that would cause the average consumer to balk, I think that it's crucial that men take proactive steps in contraception as women have always had to.
7 | Christy Michelle | 221 | 10155534483396509_10155534502171509 | I guess only us females should suffer!üò°üò° poor males, can't deal with a little cold, forget about birth control side effects!! And they need it more than us!
8 | Pettie Rose | 167 | 10155534483396509_10155534497411509 | Psh! Its just the same side effects on women's birth control pills and shots. Men are so lame. Cant deal with those little things.
9 | Emily Huang | 153 | 10155534483396509_10155534662306509 | "Twenty percent or 30% of the women who take oral birth control pills experience depression and have to take medication for it. So the difference just struck me," said Lloyd, who is unaffiliated with the new study. "They terminated this study once it showed 3% depression for the men."My exact first thought. 2016 and we don't have better birth control options, because it's still societally more acceptable to skew the burden of responsibility onto the fairer sex.
10 | John McAuliffe | 116 | 10155534483396509_10155534485191509 | If you get depression and acne, odds are you won't need birth control in the first place
11 | Tara Gaines | 70 | 10155534483396509_10155534715556509 | Male birth control has fewer side effects than female birth control and they can't take it because it is deemed too severe for them?? Also, men are fertile every day, women approximately three days a month. Seems like men should be on birth control simply based on that.
12 | Ash Lei | 74 | 10155534483396509_10155534537001509 | Obviously depression is a serious thing. And I'm in no way making light of it. But like many women have pointed out, these are side effects we also get. I'm not sure the whole study should be halted bc these side effects vary with the individual. If you as an individual experience severe depression because of birth control, than maybe you should consider other options. But don't limit it for others.
13 | Christy Kalso | 53 | 10155534483396509_10155534527441509 | Women have been putting up with these and other (worse) side effects for years. Give these men a little cheese with their whine. Birth control should be everyone's responsibility.
14 | Nadine Vincent | 63 | 10155534483396509_10155534492936509 | And what about the side effects on women from birth control and in pregnancy?!? #GrowAPair
15 | Jennifer Varconie | 38 | 10155534483396509_10155534686331509 | Because it's ok for women to suffer those side effects along with the increased risk for some cancers, but god forbid any man should ever experience the tiniest bit of discomfort.
16 | Pame Patelli | 42 | 10155534483396509_10155534561396509 | That's like literally the same as birth control. Oh wait... sorry, poor little men can't be asked to deal with emotion and the responsibility of avoiding unwanted pregnancies like women do all the time üòè
17 | Amanda Fay | 45 | 10155534483396509_10155534526916509 | ...but a lot of participants had an increased libido, experienced a boost of energy, helped in weight loss.... Fine. Be a bunch of wimpy kids, us women will take one for the team. But let's translate THOSE side effects into women's BC!!!
18 | Heather Del Giudice | 59 | 10155534483396509_10155534520666509 | Seriously?!! The side effect list of women's birth control is 10 miles long!! Can our delicate little snowflakes (MEN) not handle any side effects?
19 | Sherry Gardner Nelson | 31 | 10155534483396509_10155534553686509 | You mean that it has unpleasant side effects exactly like female birth control pills?  What about nausea and vomiting and headaches? Any of that?  If not then they really made advancements compared to what I had to deal with for 20 years of my life!
20 | Megan Russler | 61 | 10155534483396509_10155534491626509 | Women's birth control is linked to depression, weight gain, etc. but that's ok cause we're women? Ugh
21 | Eileen Dreyfuss Perry | 19 | 10155534483396509_10155534614151509 | Women's birth control has a lot more side effects -excessive bleeding, fibroids, stroke, heart attacks, cancer besides hormonal imbalance. Heaven forbid men are made accountable for their actions. Male dominated society treating women as second class
22 | Ashley Malasanos | 20 | 10155534483396509_10155534536266509 | Good thing for men, women don't completely write off using birth control bc of side effects. Wow. Talk about being a wuss! Just the THOUGHT of side effects was enough to end the study.
23 | Jason Briggs | 14 | 10155534483396509_10155534489571509 | Don't worry! Trump will lift restrictions on FDA and they will approve everrryyyythingg!!! Yay! Enjoy your cancer!
24 | Sara Taylor | 3 | 10155534483396509_10155534759311509 | Reason why I only stayed on birth control for a year into my marriage. I tried several different kinds too. My migraines were worse and more frequent, fatigue, muscle aches, weakness, weight gain, and moodiness all of this and then finally a year into our marriage severe depression that really affected my marriage and my job. I ended up quitting my job, stopped birth control, and started working on my marriage. A year later we are happier than we've ever been and expecting our first child in December. It's great that there are many options out there for women and that they work but I will never go back. Natural family planning for us.
25 | Ashley Cooper | 6 | 10155534483396509_10155534691506509 | Wow... a woman's birth control has a lot more side effects than that........  Common birth control side effectsIntermenstrual spotting. ...Nausea. ...Breast tenderness. ...Headaches. ...Weight gain. ...Mood changes. ...Missed periods. ...Decreased libido... etc.The list goes on!

1 | Stacey Joubert | 45 | 10155534415646509_10155534425661509 | Hillary's crappy campaign must be spiralling out of control. That must be the case, since CNN has decided to take a timeout from political news. üòÇüòÇüòÇ so pathetic.

4 | Petra Kroll | 0 | 10155534415646509_10155534747696509 | Would you like to reinvent the wheel? What you are describing is the normal basic principle of "hyposensitization". It has been a long time, but only works if you only react to a substance. So not for a nut allergy. Forget it, if that would work ..., then one would have tried it with me, and I would have no more problems.
5 | Miranda Lynn | 0 | 10155534415646509_10155536568071509 | There is a treatment for food allergies, without needing a patch or drugs! It's OIT. Www.OIT101.com has a directory of allergists providing this treatment in the US!

21 | Donnie Williams | 2 | 10155534328601509_10155534451461509 | Just a few things on FBI reopening Hillary investigation :1). The White House was kept out of the loop of FBI announcement. 2). The Justice Dept. was kept out of the loop of FBI announcement. 3). The State Dept.was kept out of the loop of FBI announcement. 4). Revelations showed that Obama was communicating with Hillary via unsecured email.5). Lynch stepped on FBI investigation.6). State tried to engage in quid pro quo in reclassification scheme.7). Emails may have been relocated to Google cloud.8). Emails were destroyed after House subpoena.9). Use of bleach bit was destruction of evidence. 10). Huma was in the chain of destroying devices and bleaching emails.THE FBI AT MINIMUM HAS HILLARY INC ON OBSTRUCTION. Huma can be brought before a grand jury in the upcoming week. Her remaining in the Clinton campaign damages Clinton.This impacts her vote immediately:A). It stops/slows Johnson voters/undecideds breaking her way.B). It depresses her voter intensity and stifles her get out the vote. She was already soft with her electorate and this does factor in with them not being able to go through with it.C). It reinforces trends showing undecideds break Trump.D). It stops the bleeding and begins to scab over Trump's grope gate.E). It gives Trump voter intensity a shot in the arm.F). It will increase enthusiasm and contributions to Trump campaign.Huma is the equivalent of G Gordon Liddy exposing State Dept.and Clinton plumber cover up.secrets with a deviant pedophile.The reason why FBI initially dropped the investigation is because the White House was implicated red handed. Now this will come out.The FBI probably has Huma and the Clinton campaign on obstruction with a smoking gun implicating Hillary.Immediately, Trump gets a 2-3 point bounce and an additional 2-3 if this creeps into Wed, putting the race into a tie with a Trump surge.That means AZ, UT, OH, NE, ME2, GA, MO, IA IMMEDIATELY lock up Trump.By Wed, FL, NC, NV begin moving Trump.VA, CO, PA, WI, NH, MN soften where if this stays current with Wiki and more revelations,  Trump wins this election,  GOP holds Congress, Clinton era is over. Bushies get a punch in the nose.1). Democrat vote is impacted immediately by Clinton losing voter intensity among berners, women, college educateds.2). Clinton will not get Johnson's millenials.3). Undecideds will break Trump.4). Independents will swing back Trump.So, liberal fringe and GOP ESTABLISHMENT,  you backed the wrong horse against American working people and you are going to lose election day.RIGHT NOW THE ELECTION IS 50-50 WITH TRENDS IMPROVING FOR TRUMP.THE FBI HAS CLINTON INC ON OBSTRUCTION! HUMA IS FACING A GRAND JURY WITH A DIRECT PAPER TRAIL BACK TO HILLARY!

Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.)'s perverse sexting habits, Comey was hit by harsh criticism by some of those who initially praised him.Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Benghazi Committee and a staunch Clinton supporter, said in July that he was "proud" of Comey for "doing the right thing", calling him the "epitome of... a public servant", according to Politico.Shortly after the FBI's July decision, President Obama said he would not comment too thoroughly on the topic, but praised Comey for his "exhaustive" investigation.House Minority Leader Nancy D. Pelosi (D-Calif.) called Comey a "great man" for his original decision not to suggest charges against Clinton.

He has a very large sum of money why don't they look into that audit him and find out what he is hiding or did you forget his unwillingness to disclose his tax info which is part of possibly becoming president.

And refusal to release tax records even though pissed and moan for Romney to release his !! 3) operating a Fake university !! 4) Fake Foundation. There is a clear path of the Democratic Party to take the presidency, the house and the senate... This is the core issue why the FBI director was pressured to make the announcement... #Ihaveherback üíï Grab them by the polls vote blue üíôüá∫üá∏üíô"...Comey‚Äôs behavior has been especially suspect, Miller wrote, because the FBI has chosen not to comment on or even confirm the existence of other campaign-related investigations. He said the bureau is ‚Äúundoubtedly‚Äù investigating any connection between Russian hacking into the email accounts of powerful U.S. political figures and the Trump campaign, but has rightly refused to publicly confirm whether or not an investigation is underway.‚ÄúComey refused to even tell Congress if FBI was investigating Trump camp for Russia hack, but regular updates on Clinton are apparently A-ok,‚Äù Miller wrote, adding in the final post from his Twitter flurry that ‚Äúthey shouldn't be commenting on investigations!

2 | Sean Spacek | 15 | 10155534046461509_10155534063471509 | What about when your Iranian advisors estranged husband rolls over to the FBI and sinks your presidential campaign by showing intent to mishandle and destroy State Dept emails?
3 | Nathan Yaffee | 0 | 10155534046461509_10155534385476509 | If MH 370 tries to land, scramble OTIS birds and make it land in the water, George HW Bush is STILL bitter that United 93 did not hit the White House. The ten dollar bill shows the statue of liberty burning. If you have any authority at all, make any plane claiming to be low on fuel land at least ten miles out in the water. George HW Bush might think it is funny to do this on halloween. Supposedly it was going to happen on August 7th but it didn't.

Isn't it Hideous lapse of judgement?Russia use uranium to make nuclear wespons may kill millions of Americans.It is impossible to even fathom why she would do that unless she took a good look and figured out that Clinton Foundation got 30-40 million dollars from the people who made hundreds of millions from the deal!?It was a bribe?!

Can this temple unite every faith?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Chris Adams | 394 | 10155533988081509_10155533999836509 | Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Light, noone comes to the Father except through Him!!
2 | Ivan Chuks | 209 | 10155533988081509_10155534000236509 | accepting Christ as your lord and personal saviour is the only way to eternal peace
3 | Kadie Elmore | 84 | 10155533988081509_10155533992506509 | Probably not. But that's not a reflection on the temple or the faith.
4 | Bassey BigBa Ekpenyong | 65 | 10155533988081509_10155533994141509 | It can not! Once the islamic fanatic enters there they blow everything and everybody up. Mark my words.
5 | Otto Wulff | 45 | 10155533988081509_10155534090456509 | No it can't and Christianity is not a religion it's total faith in Jesus Christ alone for salvation apart from any works good or bad. Salvation is the gift of God, Ephesians 2:8 8For it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9not by works, so that no one can boast.
6 | Jerry Ramirez | 43 | 10155533988081509_10155534062596509 | Im sure someone finds that offensive because its 2016 going on 2017 and if you even breathe funny there's someone who has a problem with that too smh.
7 | Michelle Ren√©e | 23 | 10155533988081509_10155534582881509 | Here's my view of religion; God is at the top of the mountain. Religion or spirituality is the path you take to get up the mountain. The only ones doing it "wrong" are the ones running around the bottom of the mountain telling all the others their taking the wrong path to God.Love, your friendly neighborhood Pagan ‚ô° blessed be!
8 | Scott Kuli | 16 | 10155533988081509_10155534040851509 | So CNN now thinks it's a worthy goal to "unite every faith"? Ever hear of diversity? Since when do you people think you're qualified to tell others what the "problems" with religions as they exist today are?
9 | Danny Richards | 13 | 10155533988081509_10155534598301509 | Sounds like a forming of a one world religion to me , no thanks. Jesus Christ is the only true savior period. exodus  20:3 New International Version"You shall have no other gods before me, also during the tribulation which is 7 years in total the mark of the beast will be on the scene, the bible tells us in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 that believers in Christ will not go through that time of tribulation, the unbeliever will. Revelation 13:17 Parallel VersesNew International Versionso that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name
10 | Daniel Hermoso | 19 | 10155533988081509_10155534505966509 | Lol can't help but notice how the jesus people are quick to say no and quote the bible and turn this down. Eh what else is to be expected from them..that idea of welcoming all religions wouldn't work anyways because it conflicts with all religions. All religions preach love and understanding until they find out your gay, an atheist or believe in some other magic sky person that told us to write a great story about them.
11 | Danny Richards | 9 | 10155533988081509_10155534241181509 | John 3:16New International Version (NIV)16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
12 | Danny Richards | 9 | 10155533988081509_10155534292486509 | For anyone that hasn't given there life to Christ you can do it tonight in prayer one on one with Jesus , ask him  to come into your heart and be your lord and savior , recognize that he came and died for you to be saved ,ask him to forgive you of all your sins, and lastly start living a life that Christ would want you to, and with that being said you will have an eternal dwelling place with him one day , friends today is the day of salvation , tomorrow may never come. It's that simple , some may tell you that you must be baptized , well that is wrong. Being baptized does not save someone, sure Christ would like us as believers in Him to be baptized, it's a public demonstration that you have fully trusted in him as your savior. Other religions may ask you to do certain rituals , well that's wrong as well. What I have written in the beginning of this paragraph is how you can receive your salvation in Christ Jesus. Again it's that simple
13 | M'hmd Abed | 6 | 10155533988081509_10155534132966509 | The title is misleading. Not every faith will unite, for there will be heavens and hell. There must be, otherwise how are the criminal's actions in this temporal life are to be justified? God the omniscient knows all. So you want to convince me that the good and the evil will unite? No thank you. However, it would be more proper if the title considered the idea of "getting along" until the day of judgment.
14 | Carie C Lince | 4 | 10155533988081509_10155534589236509 | I'm glad more people are being inclusive and trying to bring people together. There is a religion that is for all paths (or none at all) called Unitarian Universalism. The worship involves teachings from multiple sources and the congregation includes people from multiple faiths including those that also qualify as Atheists. If you're curious go to UUA.org
15 | Chrystal Crysy | 8 | 10155533988081509_10155534387661509 | There's just this one small thing that would cause a snafu: 'My religion/God is better than yours so I must preach it at you aggressively therefore I am better then you/you are trash if you don't believe what I tell you to.' It's people.
16 | Cata Salas | 1 | 10155533988081509_10155535821211509 | My university is very close to the Baha'√≠ temple, and it really is a marvelous piece of architecture. The goal of the building isn't to unite every religion, but to be a place of universal worship. Anyone, from any religion, can go there and pray, or just relax. That is the whole point of it. It gives a message of tolerance and acceptance, which is  much needed nowadays. I feel that many people here are loosing the point of it, and are letting their personal biases speak for them. Lets just accept that there are others out there who also believe in something, even if it's not what we believe in.
17 | Francis Quiambao Banta | 1 | 10155533988081509_10155534402891509 | Ecumenism and all initiatives to unite faiths that believe in a Higher Being and subscribes to basic human goodness and the well-being of creation is truly welcome. But it is a fact that realizing this is easier said than done. As it is with the diverse views expressed here, the idea is getting to be divisive before it can even unite. Goodluck though..
18 | Liz Nguyen Pham | 2 | 10155533988081509_10155534538036509 | I never wanted to identify myself with one religion. I say that I am agnostic and I question the will of God but at the same time I'm able to walk into any Temple or church and for me being able to say that you are capable of learning almost every religion out there and you can take in the good and leave the bad but yet your knowledge expandable Limitless it and  you more of an accepting person to anything. Because when u walk into any church or temple. You will be able to learn the history of how the religion came to be. With that said u learn the background. As u learn it u become more emphasyic. So u learn to open ur hearts to.
19 | Danny Marshall | 0 | 10155533988081509_10155535231686509 | Well the headline is misleading. This is for the Baha'i system, however they do welcome all religions to join in the fun (if you will). If anything - this would just be a way to move others forward the faith of the Baha'i. For the most part, this is a peaceful faith that attempted to unite all under the banner their founder set forth. It won't unite. It may have the power to  convert...some. Nothing will unite religious systems, it's just not philosophically possible. The temple looks beautiful tho'. No doubt! Stunning!
20 | Matthew Thomas | 14 | 10155533988081509_10155534196851509 | It's going to be about another 500 years before humans as a whole can grasp leaving the religions behind and put them in a museum. We're a worshipping species by nature. I have no issues with it personally. I used to be a believer myself years ago. Without it millions would become unhinged from reality and totally loose control so it works for keeping societies in check.
21 | Milo Moray | 2 | 10155533988081509_10155534078236509 | According to Darwin's Cathedral by Professor Wilson of Binghamton University we are genetical pre-disposed to believe in a being greater than ourselves. According to the Bible and the Quran we have free will to as John Milton says in Paradise Lost "to come to that belief of our own choice."
22 | Frank Ticas | 0 | 10155533988081509_10155536403596509 | Religion is division, while love towards others is the true way and the light. I choose to believe in Christ and His teachings. The bible states that a person that does all the things that are commanded by God to do, without knowing of God or Christ, is also worthy of salvation, if not more so. Christ praised Samaritans, a people shunned by the Jews, to reinforce the fact that goodness is not measured by what religion you are a part of or claim to follow, but by how you care for others, specially those in need and people considered enemies. I believe this by faith, and faith cannot be transferred from one person to another. Do I believe that a temple that invites any religion to worship under the same roof can make a difference? I doubt it. Faith, as beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. I pray that we all find peace and are able to love others and treat them as we ourselves would like to be treated.
23 | David Revilla | 0 | 10155533988081509_10155534939126509 | All religions are made up, and are a rip off from what the Egyptians had in place. And if you think the bible is all mighty you are wrong. The bible is a book that has been re-made hundreds of times to the liking of those who are writing it.
24 | Vicky Howard-Schultz | 0 | 10155533988081509_10155535080151509 | I am a Christian. The cornerstone of my faith says there is only one Lord and Savior. I will love those of other faiths or those who do not believe. BUT I will not water down my beliefs to be politically correct, I will not join a church that says all faiths are equal.

It is across the silence and dense dust of the berms between ISIS' Mosul and advancing Iraqi special forces that the final chapter of ISIS in Iraq will play out.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Amy Gold | 84 | 10155533988006509_10155534004051509 | The staged attempt by Obama to try to defeat ISIS in his last week in power. We know Obama and Clinton allowed this monster to exist since the very beginning of Obama's term and now he's acting like he's doing something about it.Give me a break üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2 | Stacey Joubert | 55 | 10155533988006509_10155534015751509 | This was Hillary's handy work. Let's pull out of Iraq prematurely, arm and finance "peaceful" rebel groups. Good going dumbbell. Hillary is the architect of ISIS.
3 | Jonah Darren | 12 | 10155533988006509_10155534252511509 | Hillary and Obama created ISIS? Get out of here with that garbage! That's idocracy! Was it not GW Bush who invaded Iraq for no apparent reason that ACTUALLY created ISIS? But you could go down the line forever. Was it Bill Clinton airstrikes of islamic extemism and Bin Laden that created ISIS? Was it Bush Sr.'s invasion of Iraq? Reagan's arms deals? USSR's invasion of Afghanistan? It's perpetual. Just like the war on terrorism. As long as we invade, there will be people against our occupation. We just fuel it. And they will turn to radical leaders who promise they fix and change things.We may defeat ISIS but 8 more cells will emerge to take their place. Some of you saying it's Hillary are the same one's who would be the first to take arms if another country invaded us, for ANY reason! And there's nothing wrong with that, hell I would too. But do you think the media of the invading country would say "Patriot Christian American Freedom Fighters strike against occupying force". NO! It would be more like "Radical Christian Terrorist 's attack liberating force". You can't be that ignorant. This is how you defeat terrorism. By diplomacy, and giving the people a chance to fight their own freedom, like we fought for ours.

8 | Bill Boggs | 6 | 10155533920111509_10155533926991509 | Sweet babies, very cute!On CNN today:Hillary Clinton loses close to 1,000,000 followers since Friday at 2:39pm. Hillary Clinton deny's and says they were wedding planners that she interviewed for her daughters wedding and potential yoga teachers.  Anthony Weiner was found dead by an apparent suicide with 3 bullets to the back of his head. No comment from Huma or Hillary, although they were seen high fiving each other in the front of her campaign plane. Some of the GOP are saying Hillary Clinton now knows how it feels to be aborted 10 days before delivery. Robbie Mook, Clinton's spokesman say it is still her choice and she has brought all this on herself and she doesn't deny anything.Wikileaks email has Podesta's recipe for blackberry pie, spokesman's from BLM's say that blackberry pie is racist. Podesta apologizes and leaks his recipe for fried chicken and hot sauce. All is forgiven.And on major breaking news, Trump ate a Big Mac, Burger King says, Trump is obviously by his hands, no Whopper lover. Trump responded, I love Whoppers, I even love Dairy Queen burgers. Dairy Queen responded that she was offended and is a victim of sexual abuse by McDonald's, Burger King and Donald Trump. She has filed a lawsuit. In Dairy Queens newly filed lawsuit against all 3 of them she says, "20 years ago I was hanging out with McDonald at one of his Funland, outside a McDonald's where he he tied me up. At that point Burger King and Donald Trump came down the slide at the Funland and all 3 sexually assaulted and rape me. Both McDonald and his Big Mac and then Burger King with his Whopper kept taking turns on me, says Dairy Queen. Donald Trump kissed me without my permission and fondled me.. They joked that I was better than Wendy's "Hot and Juicy. I am so ashamed says, Dairy Queen.Next on CNN, the Media, is really just sound bites for an agenda?
9 | Darren OB | 2 | 10155533920111509_10155534076671509 | Dont let Hillary see them, they look young enough to qualify as a post birth mistake.
10 | Jeff Hanson | 1 | 10155533920111509_10155533952406509 | Don't let Hillary near them as she probably thinks it's Still Not to Late!Only the  ignorant can support this profoundly corrupt woman! She Belongs in Federal Prison already!!The 25 things that are truly important about Hillary instead of this left wing fluff:1. When did she know her husband was a serial abuser, and does she feel guilty for destroying his accusers?2. Explain precisely the trades made in the Cattle Futures scandal where $1,000 was turned into $99,000 in a matter of weeks?3. Why didn't she do anything to protect the Americans in Benghazi?4. Who is Saul Alinsky and why was he her mentor?5. When she was working on Watergate, why did her boss Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, call Hillary a ‚Äúliar‚Äù and ‚Äúan unethical, dishonest lawyer‚Äù and have her fired?6. What really happened with Travelgate?7. What really happened with the Rose Law Firm?8. What really happened with WhiteWater?9. What gave Hillary the right to see private FBI files of her political enemies in FileGate?10. Why won't she turn over her illegal server with state department e-mails to congress?11. Why does your foundation accept money from avowed terror states?12. What is her take on the Vince Foster "Suicide"?13. Why did she think she was entitled to steal the White House furniture when she left?14. Why do you lie even about things that mean nothing: lying about being under sniper fire in Bosnia, lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, or lying that your grandparents were immigrants.15. Should America be concerned that in ChinaGate, the 22 people that were convicted of fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the DNC were associates of Bill Clinton?16. Did selling stays at the Lincoln Bedroom to political donors make you feel like a wh)o(re?17. Does Hillary think Juanita Broadrick lied when she said on national news that Bill Clinton raped her?18. Is she still okay that Bill goes to pedophile island with Jeff Epstein?19. Why are there so many murdered and suicided people in the Clinton's immediate circle?20. Doesn't the fact that the Clinton Foundation has to amend 5 years of its tax returns for improper reporting imply that you were involved in an illegal RICO enterprise?21. Doesn't approving the Russian-owned Uranium One deal as secretary of state--because of illegal contributions to your foundation--in fact make you a traitor to this country?22. Was it wise to have at least four Clinton Foundation board of directors that have either been convicted or charged of the financial crimes of bribery and fraud?23. Why, Hillary, did you pay your female senate staffers 72% of what you paid your male staffers?24. When you represented an accused pedophile rapist, why did you laugh when you got him off even though you believed him to be guilty?25. She said she had one e-mail address, it came out that she had two; She said she had one device, it came out that she had two: She said none of her e-mails on her private server was classified, but when the State Dept handed over 300 e-mails the FBI redacted large sections of one, proving again she was wrong. Thus, Ms. Clinton, are you incompetent or just a congenital liar?Everyone should go on you tube and watch The Clinton Chronicles -- it will amaze you what a couple of psychopaths the Clintons really are!

3 | Tinker Polston | 8 | 10155533783326509_10155533998311509 | I think that people who willfully commit murder should be shot on the spot instead of arrested or if they are arrested and found guilty and sentenced to death, they should be executed the same way they killed their victim(s) within a month of being found guilty. Mind you now, this is if we are 100% sure they did it.

1 | Johnny Washika Gachago | 44 | 10155533740246509_10155533762996509 | Black people don't vote for Hillary Clinton. In 1994, she signed the mass incarceration bill with her husband, which put many black people in prison for small related crimes. Trump wants to fix the black communities, get a better educational system, and invest more in the schools. Vote for Hillary and black people will be suffering for another 4-8 years, just like the last 8 years when we had all these promises that never came.

Hillary Clinton deny's and says they were wedding planners that she interviewed for her daughters wedding and potential yoga teachers.  Anthony Weiner was found dead by an apparent suicide with 3 bullets to the back of his head. No comment from Huma or Hillary, although they were seen high fiving each other in the front of her campaign plane. Some of the GOP are saying Hillary Clinton now knows how it feels to be aborted 10 days before delivery. Robbie Mook, Clinton's spokesman say it is still her choice and she has brought all this on herself and she doesn't deny anything.Wikileaks email has Podesta's recipe for blackberry pie, spokesman's from BLM's say that blackberry pie is racist. Podesta apologizes and leaks his recipe for fried chicken and hot sauce. All is forgiven.And on major breaking news, Trump ate a Big Mac, Burger King says, Trump is obviously by his hands, no Whopper lover. Trump responded, I love Whoppers, I even love Dairy Queen burgers. Dairy Queen responded that she was offended and is a victim of sexual abuse by McDonald's, Burger King and Donald Trump. She has filed a lawsuit. In Dairy Queens newly filed lawsuit against all 3 of them she says, "20 years ago I was hanging out with McDonald at one of his Funland, outside a McDonald's where he he tied me up. At that point Burger King and Donald Trump came down the slide at the Funland and all 3 sexually assaulted and rape me. Both McDonald and his Big Mac and then Burger King with his Whopper kept taking turns on me, says Dairy Queen. Donald Trump kissed me without my permission and fondled me..

According to a new study, a tiny skin patch may help treat peanut allergies. The patch was the most effective on children ages 4 to 11 and significantly less effective on older participants, according to a statement from the National Institutes of Health, which funded the study.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Robert Walsh | 21 | 10155533644641509_10155533684011509 | During the Sunday broadcast of ‚ÄúFox Report Sunday,‚Äù Democratic pollster Doug Schoen said he is having to reassess his support of Hillary Clinton due to the FBI‚Äôs reopening of the criminal investigation into the Democratic presidential nominee.
2 | Brian Shelley Johnson | 4 | 10155533644641509_10155533730741509 | Understanding how peanut oil is used as an excipient ( often not named on the ingredient list) in biologics used in children as young as new born, would also help in understanding the large # of children with peanut allergies.
3 | Robert Walsh | 17 | 10155533644641509_10155533669621509 | Early this evening, CNN tried to catch Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in a heavily compromising position over comments he made at a rally in Colorado. There was only one catch ‚Äî Trump didn‚Äôt say what they thought he said. And, when the network realized the mistake, they tried to stealthily cover it up.
4 | Brian Van Skiver | 0 | 10155533644641509_10155533875176509 | Let's talk about big pharma's solution, not the actual reason why kids have peanut allergies. Unprecedented. Race for the cure CNN... Race for the cure. #youraretheproblem
5 | Marie Issa Takahashi | 0 | 10155533644641509_10155533687051509 | the cause is because you feed them peanut butter everyday since they were little.it's no brainer scientifical fact that you'll be allergic to food tgat you eat everyday unlike external stimulators.peanut butter is like vegemite to aussies and miso soup to Japanese and kimchii to Koreans.consumed on daily basis but they don't get allergic to the staple food because it's fermented.it's good for health,fermented stuff could fend off influenza like yogurt and kimchii and miso.peanut butter and karaage or fried chicken is what you feed your kids everyday if you want them dead asap
6 | Peter Aleit | 0 | 10155533644641509_10155534464101509 | How about you just stop drowning kids in antibiotics? All that does is kill the gut bacteria that would otherwise help them digest food like peanuts. Not to mention most common deseases are viral anyway and antibiotics do jack against those.
7 | Todd LaLonde | 5 | 10155533644641509_10155533718821509 | The FBI has reopened their investigation into Hillary Clinton after discovering new information on the electronic devices of Anthony Weiner.Could this be the end of Hillary‚Äôs campaign or is it a distraction to draw attention away from more serious crimes and corruption within our government?On Monday thousands of new emails from Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta were published by WikiLeaks.Within that new data dump was smoking gun proof that the White House was colluding with Hillary to cover up the fact that Obama had lied to Congress and the American people when he said he learned about the email scandal from the news.Those new emails stirred outrage within the FBI and took the ongoing mutiny to a whole new level.The new investigation into Weiner could be a way for the FBI to compartmentalize the larger issue of Hillary and Obama‚Äôs collusion.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Riley Galinsky | 465 | 10155533621156509_10155533624681509 | Can we stop making Putin look like the bad guy here when he's only acting based on fear from threats he's received from the UNITED STATES?? How about instead we focus on the fact that our country is on the brink of civil war in North Dakota and not a single major news organization is covering it??
2 | Jess A√±onuevo | 75 | 10155533621156509_10155533627031509 | the missile itself can reach the US, but not with its nuclear payload that can wipe out the size of Texas, so lets not overeact.
3 | Jan White Treena Deemer | 54 | 10155533621156509_10155533676991509 | Amazes me how many people think an arrogant rich narcissist & sociopath can be President of the United States. Must be the preservatives in the food. Everyone's IQ's are dropping. Hillary has made her mistakes, but people tend to learn from mistakes so I'm not too afraid of her using a private server again. She's not ideal, but at least she has experience. This is no time in history for experiments folks. Very iffy times.

6 | Artur Mikayelyan | 23 | 10155533621156509_10155533908366509 | To start with I'm a proud American citizen! However I was born in Armenia which was part of Soviet Union until 1991.

15 | Lx Hernandez | 0 | 10155533621156509_10155534606656509 | 1. It hasn't been tested, and if so, then the report / world news would state that " parts of the world " was just wiped out.2. Putin has stated that the next war will be delt with nukes.3. The united states is pushing for this war to happen each time we think we can go plant our flag somewhere.4. We've had plenty of chances to make peace with Russia and other parts of the world. The blame falls to the house of Congress and pentagon. Not Obama or ANY OTHER president. 5. Humanity needs to be eradicated from existance. Were a threat to all that exist in life. If the bible / god is real, then history has shown us, man has killed god and god will not hold back on obliterating his creation due to a lack of respect towards him.November 8th, marks the fall of America and those who think they can claim it as there's.

If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officers, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America! Do you wish to live in that kind of country?

16 | Greg Cover | 0 | 10155533512801509_10155534051291509 | Indigenous activists are loudly protesting outside of CNN, calling out the network for refusing to cover the Dakota Access Pipeline protests.In a Facebook live video from the Indigenous Life Movement, a large group of Native American protesters is seen banging on drums and singing outside the cable news network‚Äôs office building in Hollywood. The group is calling attention to the fact that despite its massive resources and 24-hour operations, it has devoted a minimal amount of coverage to the escalating tensions at the Standing Rock camp, where over 300 tribes are fighting the construction of an 1,100-mile pipeline.
