A bipartisan poll released today showed that 51% of the American people either have a disability themselves or have a family member or a close friend with one. Judy Woodruff reports on an often overlooked political issue, the well-being of those with disabilities.

7 | Patricia Ivory | 17 | 10154726751458675_10154726768748675 | I think we define "disability" much differently than in past generations. My grandpa was mustard gassed and came home, worked and raised a family.

I have an adopted grandson who is severely disabled, but I've found him to be a font of absorbed information he can't express. The ability to express oneself doesn't equate one's ability to formulate an opinion, and even a solution.
18 | Michelle Mears-Gerst | 1 | 10154726751458675_10154726784378675 | Single issue voting is uninformed voting. Work with your local communities, states etc. We don't need to be needy on the federal Gov't for the disabled look at the mess the VA is

The Trump campaign has been fraught with bigotry, xenophobia and racism, but Republicans ignored it all. Why?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jeff McCracken | 201 | 10154726537038675_10154726662913675 | Because racism, bigotry and xenophobia are rampant among Republicans. They didn't ignore it....they either supported it vocally or silently.
2 | Chris Fraas | 100 | 10154726537038675_10154726673998675 | I agree with others that they didn't ignore it. Like the old saying goes: All Republicans aren't racist xenophobes, but most if not all racist xenophobes are Republicans. Ignorance is bliss to them.
3 | Margaret Steinhoff | 47 | 10154726537038675_10154726717683675 | This is also how I feel. It's almost over for me.  Dear Mr. Trump, It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you. For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame. It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it. By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it. You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts. Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream. Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together. You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is. In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully. But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation. And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us. You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days. I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on. I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression. I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people. I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value. I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension. I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world. Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads. Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral. You brought every awful thing about us out into the open. You will NEVER Get My Vote!LikeShow more reactions   Comment   Share.1 Michael Steinhoff.
4 | Stephen Sisson | 28 | 10154726537038675_10154726682043675 | Well, there's an opinion. PBS can certainly publish such things. But it does seem many Americans have unfortunately forgotten their elementary school lesson about discerning fact from opinion. It seems many in the media confuse the two as well.
5 | Patti Hunter Tozzi | 18 | 10154726537038675_10154726699128675 | PBS Newshour is pretty much state run media. Hillary Clinton is under investigation for so many crimes right now and this is the crap you come up with. It's total propaganda and so many minions believe it. Half the country doesn't take you seriously a  credible source of news! You are simply an arm of the Democrat Party.
6 | Peter Roy | 24 | 10154726537038675_10154726695148675 | Because the RW GOP has been reduced to a faddish scared bunch of ideological Poltroons who put pettiness and revenge ahead of properly governing for the American people.
7 | Duke Marryshow | 19 | 10154726537038675_10154726684283675 | The Republicans realize that with changing demographics this is their last best chance to elect a white man who might appoint conservative judges and justices who will continue the oppression of people of color. They are convinced that their way is the only way and no one else has the right to call themselves Americans.
8 | David Wall | 8 | 10154726537038675_10154726677048675 | I know! I know! Because the media portrayed 90% of his coverage that way. They edited his statements and did their best to pounce on one word instead of what he was truly saying. Also, because Republicans hate criminals and politicians that use their positions in government to build multimillion dollar empires in return for selling out America
9 | Connie Atkinson | 1 | 10154726537038675_10154726760613675 | What? Please post evidence that the GOP EVER supported Trump? They have been trying to get rid of him since day 1 and now they support him only because they signed a pledge to support whoever became the nominee. Paul Ryan just voted for him but would not name him, Kasich wrote in McCain. WTH? This is a poor excuse for a premise to write an article about racial injustice.
10 | Cher Staite | 1 | 10154726537038675_10154726681673675 | Several past presidents have been misogynistic filthy womanizers (no names need be mentioned). Anybody is better than the status quo. He won't have any power anyway. He's just a figurehead.
11 | Dan Woods | 5 | 10154726537038675_10154726718808675 | Because Trump supporters are uneducated idiots and miscreants and sycophants and racists.Education is the cure for ignorance and hate and fear.It was the Republicans effective destruction of our educational system and FoxNews that created our Nation of Idiots.Deplorables ???? Why would anyone embrace and rejoice being stupid and ignorant ??? Thats how nations implode. An ignorant population anywhere destroys that culture.Deplorables...that's what ruined America...Democratics did not destroy the Educational system , nor did Democrats raise College tuitions, make college loans impossible to pay back...no...Republicans did that....Why are all Red States last in education and highest rates of poverty...one answer...RepublicansRepublicans wanted slaves...they got angry ignorant racist fanatics instead..
12 | Robert Barnes | 0 | 10154726537038675_10154726767773675 | Because they are blinded by their straight up racism, bigotry and xenophobia. Once he started talking about grabbiin' them by the p**sy they realized (dimly) that he could be talking about their wimmenfolk.
13 | Nick Fox | 4 | 10154726537038675_10154726734283675 | PBS is just as bad as the rest of the media. I see pbs as not a credible news source anymore after reporting on topics like this constantly. I might as well read the enquirer. Removing PBS from my news feed.
14 | Douglas G. Sacks | 0 | 10154726537038675_10154726760423675 | Why? Because there is no longer a Congressional "loyal opposition" that cares more about the Constitution, or our country than their party. Some things transcend party and really benefit all. When you decide beforehand that there is zero chance of compromise and refuse to look for any common ground, when you decide that shutdown and gridlock are the way to govern, there is little chance of anyone moving forward. This is the Republican Party, sadly, warts and all. There were too many sycophants and opportunists during the primaries and too few voices of reason in the beginning, the way Mitt Romney was and stayed. The way John McCain should have been. They are just reaping what they've sowed.
15 | Susan Carver Williams | 0 | 10154726537038675_10154726790218675 | Sad but true that most societal ills get attention, funding, and programs devoted to helping only when white people are finally affected. Happened with teen moms, for instance, who used to be kicked out of school.  Suddenly the prospect of white suburban girls being kicked out of schools was too much, and daycare centers appeared in high schools for young parents.

Trade remains highly contentious because the United States has done rather poorly at both."

And where are investigations of the Federal government's 21 million private citizens' data breaches? Where were the Republican investigations of Bush‚Äôs bogus war that killed thousands of Americans in Iraq, the 3000+ lives lost on 9/11 during Bush's watch despite warnings, 56-60 lives lost in multiple US Embassy attacks on Bush's watch, and all those in prior administrations--e.g., Reagan who let 240 American marines die in Beirut?

Pope Francis recently reaffirmed the Roman Catholic Church's ban on women serving in the priesthood, adding that he believes the ban will likely be forever.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mandie Grace | 180 | 10154725965318675_10154726084613675 | all women have to do to fix this, is stop attending. no women, no church. That would change their minds fast.
2 | Francie Halderman | 86 | 10154725965318675_10154726081118675 | Guess what else might just be forever.  Good people not returning.  Underwhelmed with handling of the horrific long term pedophile scandal too.  Sad.
3 | Brian Bianchi | 47 | 10154725965318675_10154726078293675 | I mean really. Women dont have the qualifications to be a priest. When is the last time you heard about a woman molesting or raping a child? See? Not qualified.
4 | Donna Riddick | 15 | 10154725965318675_10154726227223675 | Institutionalized misogyny. Organized religion is one of the worst offenders, and the Roman Catholic church is one of the worst of the worst. Until we get rid of the institutions that create and support misogyny, women will never be recognized as equal.
5 | Julia Vescovi Heaton | 21 | 10154725965318675_10154726193858675 | I don't know why the Catholic Church has such a ban when Jesus so obviously didn't!!! Women make up the bulk of church goers.  Ladies, if the Catholic Church doesn't think you're good enough to share completely in Catholic Church life, the Episcopalian Church welcomes you with open arms!
6 | Leona Bryson | 10 | 10154725965318675_10154726106753675 | Sooooo? The Son of God can be born of a woman, and the first to see him rise from the dead was a woman, but there is no room for one in the PAPACY? Hmmmmmm....How does the Pope feel about Trump?
7 | Rob Ireland | 8 | 10154725965318675_10154726244153675 | Who cares? The church is and has always been an instrument of misogyny and oppression and it always will be. That's not to say there are not good people in the church, but we've had successive popes pontificating about the evils of individuals deciding for themselves whom they want to love while they simultaneously facilitate and obfuscate the rampant abuses of innocent children the clergy have been guilty of. The church is as dead as the innocence of its victims.
8 | Bryan Evans | 12 | 10154725965318675_10154726085613675 | That implies the church will be around forever. Hasn't membership been declining steadily for the last 100 years? May be time to make a few changes...while there's still a church to save.
9 | Dick Reddy | 4 | 10154725965318675_10154726225113675 | Pope Francis may be right in his prophesy, but he's totally wrong on the issue, just as JPII was.  The idea that only someone who has the same demographic characteristics as Jesus and the twelve apostles had just doesn't wash.  Remember that in addition to being men, these people were Jews living in Israel.  Presumably, then, only male Jews living in Israel should be able to be priests.  Of course, it might  be observed that while historically misogyny was accepted, it no longer is accepted in the civilized world.  It might also be observed that the Church has had great difficulty in many countries attracting males who will accept vocations to the priesthood even though a number of women are eager to accept their own vocations to the priesthood.
10 | Damon Walton | 5 | 10154725965318675_10154726173578675 | I guess its still an all men's only club at the Vatican. When over half your flock are women then you are pretty much telling them; no need to apply. Women among their ranks as equals let alone laying the foundation for the first female Pope would revolutionize the faith and Church for decades to come. And they wonder why Church attendance is down. Allow priests to marry and women to wear the Roman collar it would be a game changer. They would anoint Pope Francis for sainthood if he pushed through those reforms.
11 | Lee Dudley | 7 | 10154725965318675_10154726139103675 | Women won't be considered. And that's FINAL! However, if there are any unemployed male pedophiles currently looking for work...the Catholic Church is always hiring üòâPlease visit our careers homepage at: http://www.vaticanstate.va
12 | John Sibanda | 2 | 10154725965318675_10154726114608675 | 1. "I'm not a Catholic and I don't accept or agree to tenets of Catholicism. I expect Catholicism to change in response to me."2. Child sex abuse by Catholic priestsI'm reply:1. Don't become Catholic. Problem solved.2. People, mostly but not entirely men, sexually abuse children. Priests are people, and mostly men. High schools hid it when their sports coach preyed on children, but I don't hear you calling for a dismantling and prohibition of organised sports. More than anything else, using child victims as a prop for your flippant, very small "remarks" is disgusting, stop it!!
13 | Mona Thornton | 7 | 10154725965318675_10154726112803675 | Really, what did you expect ? He's a Catholic priest. The church cares little for women other than putting them on a pedestal like the statue of the, "virgin" Mary; producing more catholics; becoming nuns who must make a vow of poverty(not so with priests) and do the cleaning and cooking for their patriarchy.  NO WOMEN should belong to this sexist organization. They don't care and haven't a clue. Shame on him!
14 | Jacqueline Schoettle | 0 | 10154725965318675_10154726789238675 | I respect Pope Francis....but explain to me...When Jesus appointed his apostles ...priests (if he did this)....did he specify "only men" ? Were the women there to wash their feet?
15 | Kathleen OConnor | 2 | 10154725965318675_10154726226583675 | My daughter told me years ago that she doesn't want to hear that the church is low on vocations to the priesthood when they are eliminating 50% of their membership from becoming priests!
16 | Dale Richner | 0 | 10154725965318675_10154726182763675 | I think this is so sad. The role of women in our society has fundamentally changed, in a way that was not even imaginable when this rule was made. To refuse now to even consider allowing women to share their leadership talents in the same way they could have had they been born a man seems shockingly senseless, and needlessly unyielding. AND an insult to women everywhere. I can only hope women who are turned down go find another church where they are treated better.
17 | Patricia Ann | 0 | 10154725965318675_10154726794283675 | Have no more babies..raise no more sons! Do what the Chinese did in reverse..just females. Is this any different then this election? The Middle East? Religion..how to safely keep a gender down..just say..god said.
18 | Liz Feeser-Regan | 0 | 10154725965318675_10154726197733675 | That is OK it is my religion and it has always been that way, no need to get upset plenty of other things for woman to do to help make this the beautiful religion it is. I do believe though Women would make loving Godly priest and one day it still might happen.
19 | Christine Davis | 0 | 10154725965318675_10154726764723675 | A bit racist don't you think?..So far MEN are doing a bad job tending to the earth..and in the vatican, molesting children?, Woman not allowed? sounds like the middle east..but more like "man" thinks he's superior over women..but who's the ones raping people in this world? Your leading us into wars/nuclear..soon to be our own demise, So man in charge? a huge mistake.
20 | Connie Atkinson | 0 | 10154725965318675_10154726525978675 | I believe that humankind is moving past the point that we need clergy, full stop. Fighting to become part of a dying religious practice seems, to me, a waste of time. Women need to develop their own spheres of influence instead of trying to break through glass ceilings.
21 | Christine Faber | 1 | 10154725965318675_10154726488408675 | Had such hope with Francis... but the RC ban on women on the altar for anything more than arranging flowers is still a disappointment... and one of the reasons why I have been a very content and active Episcopalian for 37 years. "Male and female, he created them; male and female, we ordain them"And, for pity's sake, allow priests to wed; it makes them better priests, able to connect with their married congregants with real understanding, and in no way detracts from their calling.
22 | Shannon Flavin | 0 | 10154725965318675_10154726409158675 | Sexism and misogyny are standard practices in most, if not all, organized religions. If women wanted to send a clear message, they should quit attending immediately and boycott until things change.
23 | Seth Jacobs | 0 | 10154725965318675_10154726647493675 | Be it Catholic, Muslim, Jews, Baptist, Hindu and the other hundreds of religions. Why are women always banished from higher post. These are the people who delivered you this world. This is your daughter or wife. I DON'T GET IT! I did not raise my daughter to be subservient to any man or woman. She has two degrees married, and has her own business.
24 | Lucie Weston | 0 | 10154725965318675_10154726796008675 | One should always question an Exclusive boys club, especially a tax free, obscenely wealthy religious one that hides behind gilded gates while the world outside suffers and starves. That reality has been forever true.
25 | Susan Burns | 4 | 10154725965318675_10154726197838675 | I was in a Catholic girls school during Vatican II. They cut out the Latin, turned the altars to face the people, brought in lay deacons ... and left women out in the cold. 50 years later it is still the same. If every woman stopped supporting the church monetarily and with their labor, which the church takes for granted, I bet the hierarchy would rethink their position.

2 | William Isenberg | 0 | 10154725889793675_10154726095273675 | Corruption & Cronyism is just as bad on the Republican side. Except with the ‚Äúevil‚Äù republicans one is supposed to expect this type of behavior, but among the ‚Äúgood‚Äù democrats such behavior is supposed to be shocking. Yet Most Know it is unlikely with Trump Anything will change for most American Citizens. Since Trumps Cabinet has already been picked as well, the American public has already been convinced by the media that the source of their disappeared middle class & declining standard of living, is low wage manufacturing competition from china, devaluing of China's currency & competition from illegal immigration. So In 8 years time with no change at all having been achieved for most people, the people will be made ready to swallow yet another deception. The Middle Class will have not recovered based on the systems ‚Äúprescriptions‚Äù for resolving what the media convinced the people was the cause of their decline & the basis of the support for Trump. In Time, the citizens none the wiser regarding their unproven system which can not bring about change, the people will be ready to be put back to work for empty promises, which no one had any intention of delivering on. So Citizens will participate in elections as they always have in the hopes for being able to make changes through voting, which has not ever occurred. Except here is more proof why change can‚Äôt come from voting. - Amiir Paarrveez Sheybani

The Food and Drug Administration is asking the public to reflect on an important health question: How much Nutella do you actually eat? (from STAT)
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Julie Edwards | 63 | 10154725743783675_10154726035518675 | All I know is that I can't be trusted around Nutella so I can't buy it. My serving size is approximately half a jar at a time. Straight out of the jar, standing in the kitchen, with a glazed over expression on my face, and likely drooling.
2 | Jimmy Araujo | 51 | 10154725743783675_10154725815453675 | I'm still angry that neither candidate addressed this at any of the debates. üò°üò°üò°
3 | Vickie Jordan | 30 | 10154725743783675_10154725948443675 | The stuff is garbage! Chemical flavored palm oil. They make it out to be a health food but read the label.  Yuck!
4 | Cheryl Abadie Christians | 12 | 10154725743783675_10154726014058675 | I absolutely love it and if it is around I eat spoonfuls right out of the jar. Soooo, I seldom buy it because I'm not an idiot and can plainly discern that it is not a healthy choice. Having said all of that, the most disturbing part of this article to me is that the company quite clearly wants to be able to obfuscate the facts in order to lull the buyer into thinking it is nutritious rather than a decadent treat.
5 | Juanita Nunez-Archuleta | 12 | 10154725743783675_10154725906073675 | Nutella on a slice of lightly toasted brioche or French bread topped with fresh strawberries and sugar. Then using a kitchen creme Brule torch warming until sugar makes a nice shiny caramel mixed with the juice of the berries....yummmmm#fuckthefdaanyway
6 | Diane Olson | 11 | 10154725743783675_10154725914023675 | None, and have never tasted it. I control my diabetes by diet and I'm very successful at it. This, to me, is just more fake food. Even on my cheat day, this would not be a consideration. My peanut butter and almond butter are simply crushed nuts, with a bit of salt. If you look at the ingredients list for the national brands, YUK.
7 | Sharon Carroll Allen | 5 | 10154725743783675_10154725867188675 | I tried it once, with a dairy supplement, as I am lactose intolerant. I didn't enjoy the flavor of Nutella, so I haven't used it again. It seemed like a strange alternative to peanut butter spread, for those who can't have peanuts--the added cocoa makes it more of a dessert topping. Just my opinion.
8 | Karen Hubert | 7 | 10154725743783675_10154725903263675 | Don't be fool hearty this is a chocolate spread that should be eaten in moderation. We are already an overweight nation. Always after the money. So tired of companies trying to trick the consumer.
9 | Jennifer Jones | 9 | 10154725743783675_10154725859938675 | I think it's the same as putting Hershey's chocolate syrup on your toast, but double the calories. Delicious but obviously not exactly a health food :)
10 | JenniferBond GerardoPortillo | 1 | 10154725743783675_10154725848633675 | 2 T is what I would say we use. For my kids, I lightly toast bead, Nutella, sliced bananas. 2- sparingly spread in mini croissants with sliced bananas 3- put in small Tupperware with a baggy of graham crackers in their lunch box
11 | Neal Thompson | 1 | 10154725743783675_10154726541828675 | "Health food"? What, is Nutella a fruit or a vegetable? No. To me the stuff tastes nothing like hazelnut or chocolate. Tastes purely like sugar. How can this be called a health food?
12 | Joan Brown | 10 | 10154725743783675_10154725894808675 | You should eat NONE, as it contains palm oil , the production of which contributes to the deforestation and loss of habitat for so many endangered species on the continent of Indonesia!!  Just say NO .
13 | Karen Loretta Thomas | 1 | 10154725743783675_10154726537653675 | Ha, ha, ha, ha...Oh, seriously?It's used to fill 15" crepes. Easily four tablespoons at a time. That doesn't make it a breakfast item or a staple in your diet. It's a luxury item that needs to stay listed as a dessert.
14 | Bidisha Mukherjee Riccardi | 0 | 10154725743783675_10154725980638675 | Umm, a lot. One or two good size spoonfuls at a time. I don't have it on toast, but it's great as a drizzle on an acai bowl or on a rice cake with fruit on top. For both it's about two teaspoons or so.
15 | Victor Acevedo | 7 | 10154725743783675_10154725831533675 | I think 2 is a pretty good estimate. I had several flashbacks of me putting one tbs on toast and a second directly in my mouth
16 | Lauren Beckerle | 0 | 10154725743783675_10154726142433675 | I'm not a fan, I don't like it. I thinks it's definitely a mistake to think this should be eaten for breakfast, definitely should be thought of as a treat. There's nothing healthy about this stuff.
17 | Leo Horishny | 1 | 10154725743783675_10154726294483675 | I tried it once and wondered why this company isn't sued for false advertising.  If that's "hazelnut" flavor, Tootsie Rolls taste the same as PayDay candy bars. Nasty.
18 | Tami Allen | 0 | 10154725743783675_10154726216818675 | I just can't believe this is still so widely advertised as it contains Palm oil. Once I found that out, I stopped buying it.
19 | Eileen Ward | 6 | 10154725743783675_10154725835513675 | I looked at the Ingredients and put it back on the shelf. YUCK‚ÄºÔ∏è
20 | Molly Rex | 2 | 10154725743783675_10154726233898675 | Interesting. I was introduced toNutella in the early 90s from a friend who ate when she lived in Germany. That's how we ate it...on toast.
21 | Kristi Holden | 4 | 10154725743783675_10154725909423675 | None at all.  It has palm oil in it and that is a no-no for my diet.
22 | Sj Lag | 0 | 10154725743783675_10154726801048675 | We love Nutella I refuse to read this article in case an expert says We should not love it so much........
23 | Jo Steele | 4 | 10154725743783675_10154725824223675 | Alllll of the Nutella. Which is why it isn't allowed here anymore.
24 | Marta Goodman | 1 | 10154725743783675_10154725950768675 | Banana dunked in Nutella, yumm. I love it, but I don't buy it.

1 | Jennifer Vicent | 18 | 10154725691413675_10154725753693675 | Everything is corrupted in Washington, but Trump is not the right messenger. After Trump screwed up our Republican Party, I will never support that dangerous man. I would rather write my dog's name on the ballot.
2 | Angie Quinn | 8 | 10154725691413675_10154725889348675 | election day really should be a national holiday. considering the number of hourly-wage working folks in the U.S. - and the number of single parent households just trying to make it out the front door every morning (and not be late for work and/or school)...yeah, i think it should be a day off for everyone.

General Motors, for instance, now employs barely a third of the 600,000 workers it had in the 1970s. Yet it churns out more cars and trucks than ever.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | William H Boley | 59 | 10154725620278675_10154725718678675 | So, the loss of jobs is based not as much on globalization as on technology changes? It might be both/and, rather than either/or, but this is an interesting perspective, and one that was missed completely in the debates and discussions in the current election campaign.
2 | Brian Petersen | 53 | 10154725620278675_10154725741033675 | Massive factory jobs are never coming back to us, just look at what global companies are preparing for involving artificial intelligence and you realize  all the rhetoric in todays politics are out of touch with reality.
3 | Pattie Mcmillin | 16 | 10154725620278675_10154725804513675 | It is called"progress". And with each technological advance, comes unemployment. States so affected, with federal assistance, should help in the education and retraining process, into the new fields opening up because of this change.
4 | Chris Koester | 10 | 10154725620278675_10154725856103675 | The days of graduating from high school and getting a good job down at the plant are over. Those jobs are not coming back. Over the coming years, more and more jobs will be eliminated do to technology.
5 | S Lee Saliga | 7 | 10154725620278675_10154725798433675 | workers must update and retrain for this huge trasition from the industrial era to the technical era; there is help available. Trump builds up anger and scare propaganda just to get these workers' votes to see him as their saviour.....think reality people
6 | Rona Hampton | 7 | 10154725620278675_10154725791703675 | Toured a major brewery. 10 humans worked there. When you go to a store and you choose self check out, remember that used to be someone's job.
7 | Arvis Wright | 6 | 10154725620278675_10154725761593675 | Irony: I loved transcribing spoken words on a dictaphone machine into written words to share with others - and many did this as their profession in clerical support. Try and find a job transcribing when so many of the executive staff carry their own laptop/devices. This moment in time (automation?) has been voiced for a few decades - now it steps closer to becoming a reality. Folks refuse to see the writing on the wall - unemployment in human involvement with 'making things work' - Reality vs refusal to accept what IS.
8 | Kenneth J. Kaiser | 4 | 10154725620278675_10154725954748675 | Yes, blame robots and the computers that operate them, as well as globalization. I'm 70 and when I was a kid the rule was never buy a new car made on a Monday because the guys making it were hungover from the weekend. So, far more and far better cars are made with far fewer people than was the case sixty years ago. That's just reality and there is simply no going back to an idealized past.
9 | Phillip Day | 5 | 10154725620278675_10154725951108675 | This is well known by many, except those on the right who believe their MFG jobs Trump can bring back. Not economically possible for businesses to do that, unless they want to go out of business, no one ever claimed the Republicans were savvy at business, or economics.
10 | Mark V. Latvala | 1 | 10154725620278675_10154726165918675 | Politicians like generals, are always re-fighting the last war.  William Jennings Bryan was still campaigning on rural populism a generation after the industrial revolution changed America.  Older nostalgic and/or out-of-touch voters are the dominant bloc in American elections & so all politicians pander to them
11 | Gail Dardenne Cole | 4 | 10154725620278675_10154725814123675 | I often talk about this. So many want to blame the jobs shipped out (which are very wrong and need to stop) for our job lose. But I can tell you that tech takes far more jobs or potential jobs. Most of what I do is automating things that a person can do. My worst experience was automating a report that was someones full time job. We had a meeting to show the report create itself in seconds. The woman cried, they forgot to tell he that they had another position for her.
12 | Wayne Paige | 2 | 10154725620278675_10154726536243675 | Public corporations are generally more beholden to the shareholders. Not the employees. If they can save a buck by laying off or offering early retirement to an employee, then that's one less expense. Blaming it on some government conspiracy is just noise.
13 | Dick Reddy | 1 | 10154725620278675_10154726001028675 | Yes, irreversible technological change, change that sustains and even improves quality at lower costs is taking some jobs away from workers throughout the world, although, obviously, there's work in making and maintaining robots.
14 | Lorell Rademacher | 1 | 10154725620278675_10154725776663675 | So wait, wasn't there a story not so long ago about automation and how instead of taking jobs, it would actually create jobs? Well, maybe that was a comment feed discussion. I believe the topic was about minimum wage increases and fast food going to automation vs. paid employee. Either way...which is it? I think it's both quite frankly. Obama wants a push for middle management (mandatory college) executive based jobs because we are steering towards a less industrial nation but yet many of our citizens are neither qualified for white collar work, nor are they interested in those types of jobs. More of our industry opting for the lower tax penalties and lowered cost of doing business in other countries. Coupled with the strange, inate need of Americans to consume and collect products (which still feeds the need to produce them) it's a big win for the companies...but a big loss for America.
15 | Mason Olson | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725924688675 | The remaining workers wage doesn't increase on the same or even similar trajectory as the increase in profits for the higher ups aka management or redundant Vice Presidents or the increase in production. At some point people may finally realize that corporations are using and disposing us like an office pen. Tricking and trolling everyone to fight each other. "That loser is on food stamp!"   "These freeloaders want 15 bucks an hour" "well then that would be socialism, they are communists". Wake up merica
16 | Tyler Hopping | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725897263675 | Automation is not the cause, but the symptom of minimum wages. If you have to choose between hiring someone to turn a wrench for $15 an hour and leasing a robot to do the same work for $10, which will you choose? There is undoubtedly someone willing to turn that wrench for $9/hr, but if the law forbids it, he is out of a job. This is the same reason that when you walk into a grocery store, the self-check-out line is always open, and the other registers are empty.
17 | Edward Laitila | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725772913675 | It is just simple economics when the price of labor is higher than a robot they install robots. Robots do not require benefits, and all the extra taxes associated with hiring a human so there is significant cost savings beyond wages (these cost can be higher than the wage). Happening in fast food industry since they are forced to pay higher wages with increased minimum wage.
18 | Duke Marryshow | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154726698783675 | For years we have said this and no one paid attention. Americans will not evolve and thus will be left behind. Emerging nations are not saddled with crumbling infrastructures and a politically entrenched working class. You can start a worldwide business today and maintain it with just a cellphone
19 | Kari Orr | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725711858675 | So you're saying that they could ramp their workforce back to the 70's level and make 3x the cars? Possibly they could find economies of scale to sell three times what they sell now? Why is the answer always cut workers as opposed to sell more cars, or sell cars with better profit margins?
20 | Vivian Nelson Gassan | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154726220153675 | Robots don't join unions, demand decent wages and benefits! Don't cost the owners and shareholders as much as humans. It's all about the greed of those at the top!!!!!! The automated checkout at the store is a good example; the prices just keep going up, when there are less employees!
21 | Jacquie McColl | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154725969848675 | I remember when GM workers whined there jobs were to hard or too boring. Well higher powers listened didn't they. Bye bye jobs for people. Robots win you lose. Most of the workers back then had only a high school education and had not done any other job. Made great money too
22 | Will P. Condo | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154726278408675 | For all the hot air about U.S. job loss to Mexico, it's actually technology that has reduced the need for humans the most, not just in the US, but everywhere.

Russell | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154726174243675 | Then lay the blame on "Tricky Dick" (he really was a crook) and Ronny Ray-gun (senial mouthpiece for old, white, money) for their phony foreign, domestic and voodoo economic policies - right along with the asshats that supported these ideologues against their own best interests, out of ignorance, fear and prejudice.
24 | Robert Rex Jackson | 1 | 10154725620278675_10154725806463675 | Yeah, keep spreading that false narrative. Reagan's, 'North American Union' plan to move our largest industry across the Ambassador Bridge to Canada was called, 'NAFTA' by the time Clinton signed it. The auto industry is still there. They have plenty of robots, but plenty of workers, as well. All covered by Canadian universal health care. Which saved our automobile industry a fortune, even though it murdered Detroit in the process.So yeah, keep repeating the propaganda of our oligarchs, but we don't have any entirely robotic manufacturing facilities. We've just moved all the jobs to places where it's less expensive to staff up.
25 | Stephan Cohen | 0 | 10154725620278675_10154726122368675 | Nothing new, this had been progressing for years. It improves throughout and accuracy and lowers costs for many industries. The problem is the need for massive retraining, which may not be affordable or accessible for many.

Nevada already has legal brothels, round-the-clock casinos and a coy catchphrase declaring that ‚Äúwhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.‚Äù Voters could soon add another vice in the form of recreational marijuana.

You also spend billions upon billions trying to control it which everyone knows is a waste of money and doesn't work.

When the money malignant used to declaire providers of marijuana were Cartel affiliated and terrorists, does that mean State run marijuana dispensaries are now terrorist organizations in states such as Oregon, Washington and Colorado?

Some activists are still not convinced that Clinton will address their priorities and are withholding their votes and public support as she makes a final push.

1 | Karen Polson | 78 | 10154723653298675_10154725566013675 | I'm not a Hillary fan by any means, but I voted for her because we can push the momento forward with her. Trump is a dictator, he is the fox you let in the henhouse, that will devour us all!
2 | Deborah Sjerven | 60 | 10154723653298675_10154725593053675 | They can be very sure that Trump will not address their concerns - no matter what he has said recently on the campaign trail.
3 | Ray Cottengaim | 22 | 10154723653298675_10154725585523675 | And do you think the trumpeter will. Are you totally frickin stupid. The trumpeter doesn't even known anything about black folks period. He thinks you all live in a ghetto. Live on welfare, shoot each other, are lazy etc etc. I don't care you morons do what you want but trumpeter absolutely will not help you.
4 | Frank Andreas Sposito | 21 | 10154723653298675_10154725555888675 | Fake leftists more interested in self-righteousness and performative superiority than building a better world. Half of them hate Clinton so much they secretly wish for a Trump presidency to punish her supporters.
5 | Peggy Schmid | 11 | 10154723653298675_10154725652543675 | Black people get your A--es to the polls and not just during the general election. We have a powerful voice and we need to use it to make positive changes in our communities, schools, workplaces, health and mental care, courts, law enforcement agencies, government all across this nation.We help make America great and our ancestors died making it great!Voting is crucial and it's your duty to give your children a better life in this/our country.Please, please drive, take a bus, train, call your polling place, neighbors, run, walk hell crawl if you have to but whatever you do please don't stay home.
6 | Tony Gray | 5 | 10154723653298675_10154725680848675 | Sorry but if either Orange Hitler or Gramma Nixon wins the election, the country becomes completely ungovernable. I don't mean gridlock. I mean total madness. Who's fault is that anyway? Voters--You allowed it by way of your passivity and half-interested foolishness. With over 300 million, no reasonable person could say these candidates represent our best. Of course we know you will blame someone other than yourself for the predicament. Rather than pondering the non sequiturs raised by the mass media, take a moment to consider what is your karma in this situation?
7 | Susan Richmond | 4 | 10154723653298675_10154725968358675 | As usual, PBS comes up with the half-empty headline regarding Hillary support. How about a similar report of Trump not being supported by, say, a significant number of young Evangelicals? Or is that coming right up? -  in which case I withdraw my objection.

11 | Jo Schuster | 2 | 10154723653298675_10154725731103675 | Hillary will sell you out period.

12 | Andrew Fowler | 8 | 10154723653298675_10154725639988675 | Yeah, well some activists are DUMB.  Trump could very well win this.  And your sweet choice to protest vote won't matter a bit as the country is run at top speed in the opposite direction downward and backward.  Good luck dreamers.

15 | Mitra Raheb | 1 | 10154723653298675_10154726388463675 | the problem with her is that she has been in the system for for almost 3 decades and she has preached the same speech with little results. I also think the Weaklieaks emails which showed  how the dnc rigged the system against sanders has pushed some young for voters away. Not all but some I am volunteering in miami, in predominantly African-American area, and what I see are two thingsa. the number of supporters for clinton are not out there like they were  for Obamab. 1/3 of the African american who voted for Obama are now voting for trump. That says a lot.

Then her hubby enacted the Welfare Reform Law 1994   to get African Americans off all benefits and get a job..right after he signed NAFTA.. and jobs were gone.  The electoral benefits to Bill came from enacting Jim Crow Laws adding to the prison industry of course that wouldn't have a thing to do with Bill's side job.,. cocaine industry.. cough!... His loving spouse and Joe Malarky loved it!  The highest incarcerated population by race.., African Americans.., imagine that. ..
17 | Gerald Ott | 4 | 10154723653298675_10154726129348675 | Thx for setting emails aside (using email is not illegal, per se). Aside from Trump's bluster, groping, claims of rigging, (and apparent misunderstanding of healthcare), et al, his two real policy plans (tax cuts for the rich and $Bs more on military equipment) would do nothing to address the demands of the mobs standing at his rallies, shouting "build a wall" or "jail her" or "kill Jews.‚Äù If the authoritarian Trump wins, there'll be a lot more angry, disappointed people whose 2ndA rights may be safe, but their plates empty, coal mines still closed and their health further in jeopardy - and the world less safe, with ice caps melting and the oceans continuing to rise. I'm with her. Clean energy jobs are in her sights (to use a common metaphor). She will be president for all Americans.
18 | Jane Grossett | 4 | 10154723653298675_10154726334478675 | We're standing at the juncture of a potentially historic misstep which, if taken, could lead to our future state of Idiocracy: if we decided to let the orangutan run the country so that we could fight it out in the streets; rather than vote for the candidate with the most progressive platform in U.S. history.

20 | Richard Gougeon | 3 | 10154723653298675_10154726165103675 | The Clinton campaign has repeatedly insinuated that Russian agents were responsible for the release of the emails, but the reality is far different. It‚Äôs now clear from numerous sources that the Podesta hack, which led to Wikileaks releasing tens of thousands of Clinton campaign emails, as well as other hacks targeting the Democratic Party, were the work of U.S. intelligence operatives attempting to save America from a Clinton presidency.Sorry Hillary but all your false allegations about a mythical Russian threat as a ploy to distract voters from their own failings in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election have failed. The truth came out.
21 | Robert Rex Jackson | 0 | 10154723653298675_10154726715218675 | Neither Clinton nor Trump has any intention of doing anything that will benefit anyone who hasn't donated a lot of money. No matter what they both claim. They're the two worst candidates in living memory. It's like choosing between the electric chair and lethal injection. And like so many who've found themselves on death row in Texas, I'm not even sure how we got here.
22 | Klad Alles Bechtel | 2 | 10154723653298675_10154726410748675 | Do they honestly believe that Trump will treat them any better? And if they are holding out for a 3rd party candidate, don't bother, it's not happening this time around.
23 | Dennis Brian Smith | 1 | 10154723653298675_10154726098488675 | Dear Hillary. Support the Dakota Access protesters and adopt Bernie's platform. That's how you win over millennials, not by courting Republican women.
24 | Bill DeHoff | 2 | 10154723653298675_10154725745923675 | BLM like the rest of us have one choice. Either Hillary Clinton OR Donald Trump will be President. If anyone is not excited enough to vote, all of us will feel the consequences.
25 | Jayne Derwin | 1 | 10154723653298675_10154726308088675 | Well, that's on them. They maybe are thinking of refraining from voting or voting for Tump or a Third Party candidate, they can go ahead. If they think either of the latter is going to anything for the human condition in the Black community or any other community but the 1% then they are fools.

1 | Ann Weymouth Dean | 88 | 10154725411313675_10154725454598675 | Seems like the Army Corps of Engineers could have done this research much, much earlier. Water issues are volatile everywhere. It's a matter of common sense.
2 | Kirby Chadwick | 68 | 10154725411313675_10154725469243675 | They should just do away with it completely. After the Dakotas, it goes across Iowa, the farming heartland of America, our bread basket. What is disaster that would be if there is a spill.
3 | Gary Mandehr | 8 | 10154725411313675_10154725868493675 | If we even needed this oil, there are better and safer ways to transport it that ensure if, and, or when there is a spill, leak, or rupture, the incident would be smaller in degree of environmental impact. This whole sad situation is all the worst ,  because we don't need this pipeline.
4 | Donna Zeigler-Wood | 7 | 10154725411313675_10154725595498675 | If trump gets in you know it will all go through with orders to wipe out anyone in the way. He has financial interest. Be sure you take the time to vote!!
5 | James Jolokia | 6 | 10154725411313675_10154725608708675 | No, it has included clashes with peaceful protesters, not the other way around. Seriously, PBS, your bias is shining.
6 | Jerre Johnson | 5 | 10154725411313675_10154725670818675 | Well just where in the heck are they going to reroute it do where it isn't a potential problem to our waters or crop lands??  Poor planning from the get-go!

10 | Eppie Billena | 0 | 10154725411313675_10154726556293675 | This is insane why on earth they did not think ahead of time about routes or did they even bother to consult tribal elders about the project? All these protest would have been avoided and wasting money on law enforcement and most of all anguish of the Rock Sioux not having clean water. May be they thought no one will care, well to bad people cares about having safe drinking water.
11 | Lu EG | 10 | 10154725411313675_10154725444373675 | My open letter to my fellow democrats/progressives and fellow millennials who are planning to vote for a third party candidate or skip the election:I am NOT writing this to ask you to like Hillary, but to ask you to really, really think hard about what's at stake this election year and vote for her. If you believe we have two terrible options this time, I hear you and I completely understand. And if you were a Bernie Sanders supporter during the primaries, I understand your frustration, I really do. Whatever you think of Hillary, the reality is under no reasonable assessment is she ‚Äújust as bad‚Äù as the racist, sexist, bigoted, divisive, sexual predator Trump. Unlike any major candidate in generations, narcissistic pathological liar Trump is temperamentally, emotionally, morally and intellectually unfit to be President of this great country. Period! I am gonna "tell it like it is" here, saying I will "never" vote for Hillary is a privilege. It is a privilege women, minorities, and Muslims of this great country don't have. Also remember Bernie helped write the 2016 party platform. He used his political capital he raised during the primaries to help draft the most progressive platform in history. Please let me remind you of what's at stake:1. The misogynistic pathetic small man has shown over and over again through out his life he has zero respect for women. He has said cringeworthy horrible/outrageous things about women all his life. He has consistently insulted, belittled, sexualized, and stereotyped women. He is a sexual predator who brags about using his star power to grope, forcibly kiss, and sexually assault women. Now multiple women have accused him of forcibly groping, kissing, and sexually assaulting them just like he bragged about on tape. He has a civil suit against him alleging he raped a 13-year-old girl.  Such disgusting insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land. And he has promised to nominate conservative justices who will limit women's reproductive rights & women's ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. Remember his VP Mike Pence is one of the most anti-choice politicians out there. This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there's no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. Women can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. This sexual predator's comments already perpetuated rape culture in this country, imagine what his presidency will do. 2. Muslim Americans can't afford to have a xenophobic, small-minded bigot and his hate-filled rhetorics. We can NOT afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as con artist Trump. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believes  people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. 3. Black Americans can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights & civil and political rights. 4. The LGBT community can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT believe people should have a right to choose whomever they desire to marry. And his VP pick is the most anti-LGBT politician out there. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years and can not afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back decades.5. We can't afford to have someone who hired David Bossie as his deputy campaign manager as a president. David Bossie was a longtime president of Citizens United, a conservative group best known for the Supreme Court case that overturned campaign financing laws allowing unlimited amount of dark money in our politics so the rich can buy our politicians.  6. We can not afford to have a president who is planning  to dismantle Obama's Wall Street reform laws. That will leave middle-class families out to dry. Reforms like Dodd-Frank, which was passed in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, which left millions of people unemployed or evicted. It took years to recover and still the country is not really recovered fully. We can't afford to have another crisis!!! 7. Student loan crisis is at its ugliest. Millions of Americans are drowning in student loan debt. We can not afford to have a con man whose university was a complete scam as a president. We need a president with a clear plan to tackle this big issue.8. We can not afford to have a person who has said he doesn't believe in man-made climate change and has called global warming a "hoax," as a president. Period! Our planet needs saving! 9. Undocumented immigrants who got relief under  DACA and DAPA can't afford to expose themselves to bigot Trump‚Äôs mass deportation plan. These are millions of people who are contributing to our community and economy.  10. The next president will likely appoint 4 Supreme Court justices. Do you really want a racist, sexist, bigoted con artist sexual predator to be the one? 11. We can't afford to have a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured as a commander-in-chief. A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insulte and deride our generals but offers praise to a number of authoritarian leaders. 12. We can't afford to have a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter to lead our great country. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy never been compassion, it was always self-aggrandizement. A greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion. We can't have a careless small man who consistently incite assault on protesters & keep alluding to violence against Hillary in the White House. That's just to name a few. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. Bernie Sanders said it best: 'This is not the time for a protest vote.'

How do Americans heal this great divide?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Brian Wise | 109 | 10154724096198675_10154725320203675 | Ignorance and bigotry are best treated by education.
2 | Chuck Moore | 56 | 10154724096198675_10154725397503675 | Try being blue in a red state. I'm a communist/socialist, I must get free stuff. I love criminals. I hate my own race. I love minorities and on and on and on.
3 | George F Franks III | 23 | 10154724096198675_10154725350968675 | As technology changed. As corporations became global. And as the middle class evaporated. The US government did a little or nothing. Only an FDR type leader could have stepped in and saved the middle class.
4 | John Riley | 17 | 10154724096198675_10154725435178675 | Iowa is a good example. Lots of people on SS. Farm economy completely dependent on the government. Elected a tea party senator, and is going for Trump. Urban areas more likely to democratic. Rural areas where government support is most important will go for Trump.
5 | Karen Wieland | 24 | 10154724096198675_10154725516513675 | I've been thinking about this! I live in a rural NY county that typically votes 'red.' I find it incredibly ironic how many citizens in my county rely quite heavily on government entitlements, services, and subsidies such as unemployment insurance, SNAP, farm subsidies, Social Security Disability Insurance, CHIP, Medicaid, and of course Social Security and Medicare. These people are staunch in their belief that they are entitled to these programs (but not those other undeserving folks from around the state), and yet they vote for candidates that want to dismantle them. The lack of logic and reason is startling.
6 | Roger Komula | 14 | 10154724096198675_10154725375508675 | I am not interested in going back and healing the divide. I'm glad people are finally showing what is in their hearts and I think it's time.
7 | Ann Weymouth Dean | 13 | 10154724096198675_10154725363333675 | This was so interesting and her theories make sense. Glad she says it's "fixable" although it will take both time and dedication.   Perhaps, one by one, we can make that happen?
8 | William Spencer | 13 | 10154724096198675_10154725337458675 | Issues remaining from our Civil War, that have yet to be completely repaired. Most of our challenges as a society date from either our Civil War or WW2.
9 | Mike Everett | 3 | 10154724096198675_10154726034698675 | I like PBS! Red States depend on and despise government because the GOP teaches them to blame everything wrong in their lives on the government and government programs... Trumps rise to the position of Republican candidate for President is the result of the anti-government propaganda of the Republican Party. That said, this rhetoric has benefited the 1% beyond their wildest dreams so don't expect it to end anytime soon.
10 | Mike Taylor | 8 | 10154724096198675_10154725458668675 | Heal the divide? Our " leaders" need to be reminded that an educated society is to everyone's benefit. People in the Ivy League community are detached from the real world. Let them deal with some bounced pay checks and see how their world view changes. Hell for that matter let them do their oun laundry.
11 | Peter Stelman | 10 | 10154724096198675_10154725474248675 | "they feel especially Democratic administrations have favored blacks, women, immigrants, refugees. And all of these groups, they see as getting ahead of them, as almost like line-cutters, pushing them back in line."I can understand that feeling toward new immigrants, but to feel that it's unfair to give blacks and women parity in the workplace? It's obvious that blacks and women were oppressed and treated unfairly - and still are. Do these people prefer to keep oppressing them? I bet they wouldn't want the same done to them. What do they think would be fair? Don't black people have to support themselves, and their families, just like white people?
12 | Bruce Mccoy | 2 | 10154724096198675_10154725720393675 | There is common ground about what problems to fix, but not about how to fix them. Why didn't she try a northern red state, like Wyoming, they don't think the government is just the North as winner of the Civil War, which she sees as the basis for mistrust. She has that wrong. Jonathan Haidt's book "The Righteous Minid" is more revealing about the differences between right and left, and why is hard to change deeply embedded views.
13 | Haley Hyatt | 2 | 10154724096198675_10154725867253675 | I'm blue in a red state, and it's not easy. And I just read a comment slamming red state people ending with "Who needs them?" And another condescending comment, "Ignorance and bigotry are best treated by education." Well, certainly education is a great, much needed thing. But you make a mistake by slamming all Red state people, by stereotyping them all as ignorant racists. Some are -- but not all are, by any means. I have friends (to my great despair) who hold Ph.D.'s and are Trumpers. We need to connect and communicate on issues -- while not affecting an attitude of superiority. It alienates people who otherwise might be open to reason. Of course, it feels good to be self-righteous and put down other people as stupid. But it does not endear them in the least to your cause.
14 | Dwight Snider | 2 | 10154724096198675_10154725724283675 | Conservatives saw how Nixon made opposition to the Vietnam War a wedge to drive between Republicans and Democrats. Nixon did not even need a majority. He created them by saying they were there but they were "Silent".Seeing this, conservatives went on a binge of building think tanks whose sole purpose was to create more and more wedge issues that demonized liberals. Conservatives are so brainwashed with these wedge issues that they can't break free of them even when they KNOW Donald Trump refutes most of their deeply held values.
15 | Julie Williams | 2 | 10154724096198675_10154726423928675 | I say cut off these states federal "welfare" and see how well they do standing on their own feet and not relying on the government nanny system. They should only get back what they pay in taxes otherwise they are no better than the welfare people they complain about.
16 | John P. Koury | 3 | 10154724096198675_10154725681323675 | They are the least educated, have the highest % of smokers and obesity, highest unemployment rates, most guns per person, and nearly all are governed by "Republicans. They hate the US government, while sucking greedily at its teats. Who needs them?
17 | Mary Ann Simmons | 4 | 10154724096198675_10154725550353675 | We've become a divided nation of 50 city-states. How can we have 50 interpretations of laws? (abortion, voting, pot, forfeiture) Keeping the courts busy, wasting money, and allowing national government to stand still while a handful become obscenely wealthy.
18 | Mary Lou Meisler | 0 | 10154724096198675_10154726492653675 | We gleaned a fair amount of information from this interview and have decided to purchase the author's book in order to find out how the far extreme right came to pass. Their has to be some reasonable explantation for the amount of anger they have pent up inside themselves. Kudos Jeffrey Brown.
19 | Milton Kenneth Moore III | 3 | 10154724096198675_10154725715993675 | Get rid of extreme ideologues and elect people who care about the people and the country, yeah I know, that will require actual research and factual knowledge.  I think it's worth it.
20 | Frank Bauer | 18 | 10154724096198675_10154725369558675 | Ignorant rednecks. They hate the government SO much, but seem to have no problem with collecting welfare.
21 | Jim Patterson | 5 | 10154724096198675_10154725430643675 | We get over this by NOT electing ANOTHER CLINTON! These people have SLIMED the political landscape for the past 30 plus years only to serve their own personal pleasure!
22 | Kelcy Cole | 0 | 10154724096198675_10154726298388675 | First, some lessons need to be taught.  First one would be to give no red state any more federal dollars than they send to the treasury in taxes.  Each year when they hit the limit then they have to do without government for the rest of the year.  First time it happens they will have decide whether they love it or leave it.
23 | Lisa B Hawkes | 8 | 10154724096198675_10154725468968675 | education.... Republicans have been doing their damnedest to dumb down their constituents for decades... cutting education funding.. demonizing school teachers.. promoting religiously motivated woo science in the curriculum... giving Texas the power to determine what goes into textbooks... publicly ridiculing educated people as "elitists" ... could we start repairing the damage they've done with re-introducing proper Civics Classes?
24 | Alex Perez | 0 | 10154724096198675_10154726834138675 | Won't happen until the devide between the urban and rural with different cultures  find and maximize commonalities. Communication  gaps must close. The cities have to become more humanized and the rural more deversified.
25 | Roger Komula | 7 | 10154724096198675_10154725408973675 | People in this country aren't led, they get herded. Politicians spelunk public opinion using polls like a book of matches to navigate a cave. The match never shows enough ground to choose a safe path, they just stumble in a new direction until they light the next match. No real route to freedom is possible unless things get lighted up.

Under state and federal laws, insurance plans must cover mental health services equally compared to other forms of care. But millions of patients across the country still struggle to get the help they need.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Liz Feeser-Regan | 24 | 10154724064843675_10154725214373675 | There use to be better Mental Health in this country, then along came Ronald Reagan who cut off funding to mental state run hospitals (yes hospitals just for mental health), hence we saw the number of homeless go way up. When a reporter ask him what are you going to do about the homeless his answer. "Tell them to get jobs." This stop the progress of mental health to this country, just think how far we might be today if the funding would have continued. He also stop funding to children's homes and started the foster care system which has always been a mess. Did you know that about 80% of the kids who went through children's homes went on to college in the 50's, 60's and 70's, if you went  to college it was paid for,  compared to 5% who are in foster care.
2 | William H Boley | 11 | 10154724064843675_10154725244153675 | Adequate coverage and some coverage are two different things. And the big for-profit insurance and managed care companies, focused on their bottom line, still control this business. End of story.
3 | Paula Kay Schmidt | 7 | 10154724064843675_10154725466458675 | honestly, until the US addresses the mental health crisis in this country we will continue to be plagued with mass shootings, domestic violence and other forms of evil

5 | Marika McGregor | 0 | 10154724064843675_10154726839723675 | The struggle isn't always with the insurance. With my experience, it lies with the therapists/counselors/psychologists. When you do find one that actually takes new patients, they rarely answer their phone and then expect someone who barely had the gumption to call in the first place, to leave a message. I have not found insurance to be the culprit. The people who are supposed to help people with mental issues simply do not make themselves available. Plus their receptionists, in my experience, have no clue how to speak to someone making that call. It isn't same as calling about allergies!!
6 | Mel Gee | 5 | 10154724064843675_10154725183788675 | We have insurance we can't afford to use. Just pay the premiums in case you have a catastrophic issue. It's a shame

8 | Julie Wadsworth | 3 | 10154724064843675_10154725428133675 | Considering all mass shootings are blamed on mental illness you would think more resources would be funneled there.

OUR employers do pay the same premiums as the employers of affluent patients, and WE end up subsidizing the rich because we don't draw down the benefits. It's disgusting!

Does Donald Trump prove that political consultants are unnecessary?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Richard Boyer | 6 | 10154724004618675_10154724509383675 | Trumps a bit of a one off, his strength is saying whatever the people in the room want to hear with conviction and a straight face. A politician that really wants to do that as a career, rather than a chance to pump up his ego, listens to people with insight.
2 | Remy Jagla | 4 | 10154724004618675_10154724466303675 | If you listen to them...yes. If you blatantly ignore them, it's a huge waste of money. Basically, your campaign / presidency will fall apart at some point if you are a major douche canoe. You might get elected even without help but at some point, arrogance will get you no where fast. Trump'a ship has sailed though. He not only ignored his help but he flipped them off metaphorically speaking from the stage. He might as well let them all go now, save some cash. Since he only likes the sound of his own voice.
3 | Valleri Churchill Callahan | 0 | 10154724004618675_10154725341168675 | No, it just proves that Donald Trump is incapable of listening and staying on track. There is a portion of the population that will always be attracted to demagogues. If he truly had the chops to be president he'd LISTEN to people who do politics for a career. He lacks the wisdom to do so. However, people who like him overlook his ignorance and hubris.
4 | Jerry Gross | 0 | 10154724004618675_10154726776868675 | I would say Karl Rove was of great benefit to G. W. Bush and Republican Party. He continued to strike at Alabama's democratic governor using the DOJ to send the governor to prison. From what I understand the case was decided by a judge appointed by Bush. By doing so Rove paved the way for Riley to become Alabama's republican governor. Today Alabama is almost in total control of republican politicians and the corruption appears to run from the governor on down. So, when addressing corruption in the state of Alabama remember there were powerful republicans in Washington who really made that possible. The corruption began long before it finally boiled to the top.
5 | Tom Stowe | 0 | 10154724004618675_10154725396153675 | All you need is the right message to sell to your particular audience. Donald Trump has seemingly tapped into that portion of America that is pissed off, and through his Bombastic Rhetoric he has pumped them up. Hillary Clinton on the other hand is still playing the politician, and she has to stay with in the confines of the political playbook. Raw Unrefined Energy vs Controlled Pandering. All you really need is to be a smooth talking salesperson, who can sell yourself to those you're trying to control. In the end I haven't been sold on either's product line. United We Stand, Divided We Fall.

8 | Sj Lag | 0 | 10154724004618675_10154724542593675 | Jeb Bush probably not the best example because I just do not think He wanted or needed to be the next President of the United States compared to someone like Senator McCain. No paid consultant can replace that fire inside the candidate themselves. This is not a criticism of Jeb Bush, good man great family . Perhaps His time was earlier 2012 . Senator McCain set the world of fire with his passion. I voted twice for President Obama but there are good people on all sides in politics and we should not be afraid to say so.

California‚Äôs Prop. 58 aims to expand bilingual education. Here‚Äôs how both sides see that issue.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Beth Grant DeRoos | 3 | 10154724002173675_10154724607063675 | We are a multilingual family yet this piece and Prop 58 are so Spanish language focused. Why? Our biggest competition is China, which is why I support bilingual education that stresses Mandarin Chinese.
2 | Elaine Shute | 2 | 10154724002173675_10154725086773675 | With no background in education, and quoting no sources, where does Ron Unz come off declaring that bilingual education doesn't work? Why is anyone even listening to him?Why didn't this news piece focus on that?
3 | Chad Ashton Robbins | 1 | 10154724002173675_10154724554613675 | Nope!! Teaching native English speakers to speak Spanish is stupid considering that the overwhelming amount of  Hispanics people in this country are bilingual already. So why waste tax dollars to teach native English speakers to be able to speak to what....3% of the US population?
4 | William Maxwell | 1 | 10154724002173675_10154724629388675 | Let's take care of our own first. Many of the black kids in my mixed-race neighborhood speak English as if they had just stepped off the Mississippi cotton Plantation last week with no foreign languages under their belt. Communication is the key to succes and they desperately need help
5 | Rick Moreno | 3 | 10154724002173675_10154724370103675 | The children will automatically learn the language of the country they grow up in. They have friends, playmates, schoolmates, etc. that speak [English] When I started school in the 60's I didn't know the language. In one school year I learned. Now, I'm more fluent in English than Spanish.
6 | Cate Callahan | 2 | 10154724002173675_10154724269993675 | I wonder, though, if it would be better for the kids to spend one year just learning to read, speak and write English, then to enter the grade level best for them.
7 | Sj Lag | 0 | 10154724002173675_10154724549278675 | Hope it passes teach the children in any language they can succeed in. They will pick up English quickly with out the stress. Forcing children to give up their first language is wrong. Tell them how lucky they are to know Two languages and what a wonderful asset that ability will be in the future.
8 | Ric Brown | 11 | 10154724002173675_10154724153803675 | The U.S. is among relatively few countries on the planet that does not REQUIRE bilingualism from its students.
9 | Bryan Evans | 1 | 10154724002173675_10154724176213675 | Focusing on teaching in Spanish instead of improving English as a second language is not doing them any favors.
10 | Janet Wheaton | 5 | 10154724002173675_10154724185783675 | Teaching basic subjects in Spanish until kids are fluent enough in English to understand keeps them from getting behind and encourages them to stay in school.
11 | Shane Alg | 2 | 10154724002173675_10154724598128675 | I wish we'd stick with science, the best scientifically proven methods, and leave politics out of how we teach our kids.

15 | Larry Shea | 3 | 10154724002173675_10154724278838675 | Great!! Everyone should know multiple languages.
16 | Corrie Beversdorf Vonfeldt | 0 | 10154724002173675_10154725801793675 | There are a lot of benefits to being bilingual.  I don't know about this specific bill as I live in WI.  However, I am currently pregnant and know very minimal Spanish from the two years I took in high school.  I plan on learning Spanish and teaching my child as I go so that we can both be bilingual.
17 | Claire Bascara | 1 | 10154724002173675_10154724468888675 | Great story on Adelante Spanish Immersion School!  So happy that all three of our kids were able to enjoy their elementary years learning both Spanish and English at Adelante :)  Dan Bascara

24 | Duke Marryshow | 0 | 10154724002173675_10154725439458675 | Studies have shown that bilingualism boosts cognitive functions. That's enough of a reason.  We do not need smarter people.

1 | Michele A Wilcox | 58 | 10154724000348675_10154724080278675 | Trump's been in 4,056 lawsuits, and found guilty of breaking federal law 237 times. He's currently under investigation for:1. Illegally using his charity for personal legal fees and fines.2. Trump University- fraud, racketeering, and misrepresentation.3. Raping a 13 yr old girl. Trial brings Dec. 16, 2016. Case 1:16-cv-04642 Filed 06/20/16.4. Illegally paying off the Florida Attorney General to avoid being investigated for Trump University.5. Illegally violating US laws under the Cuba embargo.And, he's been found guilty of rape 4 times and sexual assault 20 times, all of which he negotiated a plea deal to pay the women off.Most comprehensive research on Trump's lawsuits and criminal indictments:http://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/trump-lawsuits/
2 | David Smith | 24 | 10154724000348675_10154724063898675 | If the FBI had done their job correctly from the start Hillary wouldn't be an option. Bernie would be in and the election would be far different.
3 | William Miller | 8 | 10154724000348675_10154724186978675 | Don't we want our journalists to be neutral? I cannot express my disappointment in the NewsHour..  No, I am not a supporter of either major candidate.  Frankly, I am dreading Nov. 8; voting for the lesser of two evils, doesn't really work for me,as you're still voting  for evil.  That being said, I cannot believe how the NewsHour has changed; I think it corresponds with the exit of the MacNeil Lehrer production company A couple years ago. Their reporting is blatantly proClinton, at least a half dozen times Judy W. and her guests made mention of the possible connection of Trump or his advisor(s) with Russia.  Yet, there was no reference to the article in yesterday's NY Times that said the FBI has NOT found any connection. Judy's guests mentionEd that the FBI has become politicized - how about the President's comments yesterday or the day before stating that he had full confidence in the Director and that he was a man of intrigity. Furthermore, I don't seem to recall  in July after Director Comey decided not to recommend charges be pursued that the Newshour claimed that the FBI was politicized.  It's not the FBI but rather the media that's been politicized.  Lastly, the Newshour timidly reported that the polls showed the race is tightening.  However, the most recent polls show Trump either tied or ahead.  So,  Judy and Gwen what is going on!

5 | Chuck Finley | 5 | 10154724000348675_10154724206603675 | Shame on you HewsHour. You need to be re-branded the Hillary Channel. There is nothing fair and balanced about your election coverage. You're not even pretending to be unbiased. Every mention of Trump is negative; every mention of Clinton is positive or neutral. You have permanently damaged your brand! I hoping you all get fired. This assessment is from a citizen that is NOT a TRUMP supporter. Trump being elected President is the second worse result America could have. I waiver between a protest vote for Johnson or a vote for Trump only to stop the Criminal Clinton Empire. Your biased reporting only pushes me to vote for Trump (something I really don't want to do)!
6 | Russell Claxton | 6 | 10154724000348675_10154724238788675 | If you'd asked anyone, say, two years ago, if they'd vote for a narcissistic sociopath who ordinarily can't tell the truth, typically stiffs anyone foolish enough to become his creditor, sucks up to Vladimir Putin, is facing lawsuits for statutory rape and for running a fraudulent "university," how many "yesses" would you expect?
7 | Eileen Ward | 5 | 10154724000348675_10154724097258675 | Not to me. If they had early voting opportunity in NJ I would have voted already. Have been waiting years to cast this vote
8 | William Isenberg | 3 | 10154724000348675_10154724147103675 | She is an assault to justice. The FBI needs to find intent on Hillary's emails? 18 U.S. Code 2071 states the following in section B: "Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States."

Whichever one of them wins will have a staggeringly immense amount of power and authority along with unprecedented insight into -->OUR<-- private affairs and interests.There is absolutely no amount of information about them that is too much or too candid for the Public to weigh and measure. That is true for all those who hold positions of Trust and Authority over the People. If they want their personal privacy, they are perfectly free to remain in the private sector and then they will only have to worry about who in government has access to their secrets and what is being done with it.... just like the rest of us.

13 | Miss Elizabeth Marie | 0 | 10154724000348675_10154724909993675 | who cares? no politcs were discussed, nothing that matters for people to understand to make an informed choice. it was mud slinging central thanks to the Clintons, the dems and the media. I'm not saying Trump didn't do it, but usually just in response to what was being thrown his way as a matter of dumping it where it belonged right back at them. But at least he talked about his position and plans which is more than I can say about Clinton. However at this point in time Johnson is the only viable option for America

He's been flashing us for pretty much the same 3 decades...  we watched him fail -- yes, bankruptcy is FAILURE, I like successful business people, don't you?  We watched him mistreat 2 wives, cheating and leaving them, marry a third who he also cheats on, good family values? I don't think so...   his is indicted and being taken to court for theft of services (by hundreds of companies and individuals), rape of a child, and a variety of unethical and often illegal business practices...   and Oh, yes...  despite them trying to surpress it: the FBI has at least one open investigation ongoing...
19 | Scott Short | 0 | 10154724000348675_10154725397333675 | I have been perplexed by Trump's slogan "Make American Great Again" - what he is referring too, what era? It suddenly dawned on me he is talking about the 1970's early 80's, when sex, greed & excess was celebrated, when gold plated everything was stylish & being a playboy was interesting...that was *His* era. Most of us learned from the mistakes of that time , but he stayed there & worse he wants to go back there. He wants to once again be celebrated as the King of Greed , selfishness , and ego - he didn't learn - he didn't grow - he never became a more aware human. He wants to go back there so badly he is willing to destroy this country if he doesn't get there. That's my take.

The traditional "Day of the Dead" got started a little early in Mexico City, where a parade featured more than a 1,000 dancers, acrobats and actors. PBS NewsHour Weekend's Alison Stewart reports that it was inspired, in part, by SPECTRE.

Every year from November 1-2, both Mexicans and people around the world honor their loved ones with offerings or ofrendas displayed on colorful altars decorated with pictures, bright flowers, candles, and their favorite foods and beverages. Today's Doodle captures the intricate tissue-paper cutouts that have been used in Mexican celebrations since the 18th century. On D√≠a de los Muertos, the bright, delicate paper banners indicate that life is fragile and fleeting, but it's also full of beauty and delight.Also, be sure to explore and celebrate one of Mexico's most popular and magical traditions with Google Arts & Culture at g.co/diademuertos"

"Concerning the ordination of women in the Catholic Church, St. Pope John Paul II had the last clear word on this and it stands, this stands,"  the pope said today.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Janet Fredmund Kuplinski | 516 | 10154723729748675_10154723948218675 | Well the Catholic church is and will continue to see numbers dwindle as modern women realize the male dominated hierarchy is not good for them.
2 | Kim Ann Silfven | 249 | 10154723729748675_10154723960828675 | Probably the main reason I left the church was its stance on all things female, or even all things not heterosexual white male.
3 | Anne Gilmer Merson | 162 | 10154723729748675_10154724015148675 | And yet women have been the most ancient priestess of early history. And healers as well. The Catholic Church is denying all the spiritual contributions that women bring to this earth.
4 | Christine Turner | 84 | 10154723729748675_10154724009433675 | This is why I left the Roman Catholic church. I am now an Episcopalian. God gave the two most important tasks of bringing Christ into the world to women: His birth and the news of his resurrection. I will allow no man to limit my ability to carry Christ's light into the world. Here endth the lesson.
5 | Julie Worley | 90 | 10154723729748675_10154723942523675 | Funny how many religions don't allow women in leadership positions... Islam, LDS, Catholics, Baptists, Evangelicals, Orthodox, Judaism... come to mind right off the bat. And, how many women go along with it.
6 | Nancy Mac | 97 | 10154723729748675_10154723959848675 | Because religion is all about domination. But so glad folks are slowly waking up and are having faith in themselves instead of a world of the supernatural.
7 | Meg Stiles | 56 | 10154723729748675_10154723947528675 | Because religion will always be about empowerment of men over women. Which is why I will never affiliate with any of them.
8 | Laurel Kalinoski | 41 | 10154723729748675_10154723986978675 | This is disappointing. The Catholic church needs to evolve. The nuns do all the dirty work and get no respect,priests can't marry,but they can counsel on marriage. The Catholic church doesn't realize we're not in the dark ages anymore. Also,when it's time for a new pope,they will go backwards by choosing an ultra conservative one. Francis has been somewhat of a renegade for many to stomach.
9 | Joseph Sousa | 41 | 10154723729748675_10154723938953675 | Priest should be married and male or female they should be equally able to serve GOD. To not be the catholic church will self destruct . Such an exclusionary church and one that I belong to.
10 | Theresa Riga | 39 | 10154723729748675_10154724008903675 | It is the mother/maternal figure who nurtures religion in children.  It is the mother/maternal figure who makes sure the children get to church, put their weekly donation in the basket, take their Sacrements, and give thanks at the dinner table.  If the Roman Catholic church chooses to continue seeing women as subordinate, even though it was a woman who bore Jesus, and women who stood by his side and wept as he hung from the cross, then it's time for modern women to stop donating to an organization that devalues them and all they do to preserve the faith, and create their own religious organization.
11 | Cynthia Plumstead Hollenbeck | 19 | 10154723729748675_10154724201143675 | That is reason enough for every female to leave the Catholic church.  And every father of a female.  And every brother, husband, cousin, son.  Any religion that doesn't value women as well as men in this day and age has got to go.
12 | Kay Baron | 25 | 10154723729748675_10154723977413675 | just can't see how they could possibly share the wealth!  It will always be a boy's club...even though the really EARLY church included women is everything!
13 | Krista Behymer | 28 | 10154723729748675_10154724007188675 | Don't hold your breath waiting for the church to join this century no matter how cuddly this pope may seem. The church is only interested in controlling women not ever treating them as equals.
14 | Anna Mountain | 18 | 10154723729748675_10154724070303675 | Well Pope Francis to say this is disappointing is an understatement. I hope women continue to leave the church in recorder numbers. The mysogyny of the Catholic Church is a shameful fact. I thought you were a progressive--too bad. I expected more from the man, who said that the Garden of Eden was a myth. The reasoning behind the mysogyny in the Catholic Church is also based on myths, not the least of which was the apple in the Garden of Eden.  Shame on you.
15 | Anne Fitzgerald | 8 | 10154723729748675_10154724126003675 | this long held "policy" is indicative of the power of women.  The Catholic church knows it and that's why they have refused to allow women carry any position that carries power, it is out of shear fear that women can and will do a much better job at being inclusive, compassionate, and bringing people together regardless of their sexual orientation, and regardless of how much they tithe, and that is the polar opposite of how the church has been run under the "leadership" of men, and will continue to run itself into the ground as long as they continue to disregard women
16 | Roseann Sparks | 5 | 10154723729748675_10154724325718675 | The Catholic Church is a joke. They covered up and protected pedophile priests and are still protecting. Send Cardinal Bernard Law back to the states to answer for his protection of pedophile priests in Boston. He protected one priest accused of molesting 130 children. There is no excuse or rationalization for this. Shame, shame on them!!!
17 | Roxanne Moger | 3 | 10154723729748675_10154724646663675 | I know so many truly wise and wonderful women ministers in the Protestant denominations. It makes me sad to think that Catholic congregations will never experience Christ and Christian fellowship through women priests.
18 | Lorraine Alden | 5 | 10154723729748675_10154724109823675 | The Catholic Church exists to promote and entrench patriarchy. Luckily there are other doctrines that enfranchise females. For example, the Episcopal Church of American has music, incense, ministry, traditional dogma, and High Church ritual while offering women and the LGBTQ community equality and respect.
19 | Pat Smith | 6 | 10154723729748675_10154724304903675 | They just don't get it. Any religion or culture that makes women second class citizens lack concern for alll members of the human race.
20 | Margaret Feightner | 2 | 10154723729748675_10154725296823675 | Once again the Catholic Church is permitted to discriminate against women because a group of men, living in an era when women were treated as chattel, decided to keep the power of the church to themselves.  It is more than time for this church to recognize that leaders can be female.
21 | Karen Babri | 5 | 10154723729748675_10154724295528675 | Pope Francis is missing a golden opportunity to benefit from the theological insights of half the world's population. This is very disappointing. Pope Francis had created so much good will, this position on the priesthood for women is unraveling that good will.
22 | Jackie Ofner | 6 | 10154723729748675_10154724117408675 | I am so shocked that a patriarchal religion would say that !!  Do the nuns live in gorgeous castles in Italy and around the world?  No, they do n't. Do the high level priests? Yes, they do. There you have it.
23 | Sue Murphy | 7 | 10154723729748675_10154724147148675 | Sad,very sad.I'm a 74 yr old Catholic ,but man it pisses me off when this pope acts like a  jerk.  l thought he would be more in tune with the times ! I really don't think Jesus cares .He wants us to love Him & to love & be kind to one another .
24 | Gaby Lacrampe | 0 | 10154723729748675_10154725369818675 | Pope Francis is referencing the late pope‚Äôs 1994 declaration that the church has ‚Äúno authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women.‚Äù Really? But it has the authority to decide it's a "boys only" club? Although it was Mary if Magdala who preached the Gospel first? She was mentioned more in the Bible than any of the disciplines. Men are making up stuff to continue their power play rather than focusing on scripture. "Thy will, not mine", guys...
25 | Jacqui Macdonald | 8 | 10154723729748675_10154724074753675 | Why would any women be a Catholic. What he is basically saying is that women do not have the ear of God. Left the church because of their dogma and rituals that don't make sense in this world today.
