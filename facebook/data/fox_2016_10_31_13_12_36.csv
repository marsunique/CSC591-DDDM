CNN has severed ties with Donna Brazile after another leaked email showed the interim DNC chair shared a debate question with Hillary Clinton.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Amir Parvez | 219 | 10154750075056336_10154750079046336 | Hillary Clinton is a threat to American Democracy (what's left of it) and world peace. A vote for her is a vote for worldwide economic slavery and evil, endless war! She's a corrupt, evil, lying warmonger who already has blood on her hands of thousands of people and millions of dollars of blood money in the Clinton Foundation. #NeverHillary
2 | Brenda Kimmel Crump | 91 | 10154750075056336_10154750077171336 | Donna Brazile, the interim chairperson of the Democratic National Committee, is praying for divine intervention in the election. Brazile even quoted Psalm 130:5 and accompanied it with a message urging constituents to get out to voteha fine time to get religious now. you believe in murdering infants in the womb, believe in selling dead baby body parts, believe in allowing terrorists to come to our nation and rape our children, murder Christians, Jews and homosexuals, believe in taking away our religious rights and beliefs, - sorry donna this religious thing is not going to work for you. little too late prayer won't be heard. the Lord knows who is lying.
3 | Gayle Reich | 70 | 10154750075056336_10154750078871336 | AS if CNN didn't know?? This woman is probably just a scapegoat
4 | Susan Kimbro | 41 | 10154750075056336_10154750084986336 | LMAO...does CNN really believe this little gesture will make them a legitimate news organization again?  That shipped has sailed, and it's not coming back.
5 | Linda H Dunbar | 18 | 10154750075056336_10154750082471336 | ALL of the journalists at cnn need to go!  Donna barzile was just one of many at cnn with either little, or NO moral compass!
6 | Michael Paul Ireson | 5 | 10154750075056336_10154750084551336 | CNN has lost all journalistic credibility by conspiring to affect tax payer funded debates.Their company should never again host or be directly involved with tax payer funded debates.#DonnaBrazile#PodestaEmails
7 | Seana Streich Taylor | 13 | 10154750075056336_10154750081706336 | Wow. Leaking questions that frankly didn't help hilLIARy sound any more knowledgable and she STILL got her butt kicked by Mr Trump, sure cost Ms Brazile a WHOLE lot!
8 | Jeffrey Preyss | 16 | 10154750075056336_10154750078936336 | Lmao... cnn backs hillary anyways...poor Donna was simply a fall guy
9 | John Jason | 1 | 10154750075056336_10154750090081336 | CNN is issuing damage control to save face and keep CNN as a major news source. They'll fire a few scapegoats for the time being and see if it dies down. Most of the people in CNN are on the Clinton ticket and are corrupt propagandists.
10 | Tony Burroughs | 1 | 10154750075056336_10154750090351336 | With all of the corrupt BS going on with Hillary we still have brain dead idiots that will vote for her, this is why we need Donald Trump in office to make America great again.
11 | Cody Choate | 0 | 10154750075056336_10154750087926336 | Okay what is going to be done about it? I guess being unethical means nothing. If Hillary Clinton is elected all that voted for her should be considered co-conspirators to all thier crimes..
12 | Amy Woodard Frazer | 7 | 10154750075056336_10154750084356336 | Trying to save face by pretending it was all Donna and not you CNN? Just like the HRC camp will make Huma the scapegoat... #wakeupamerica #CrookClinton

14 | Jason Picard | 0 | 10154750075056336_10154750089266336 | I think the media and the liberals are deaf and dumb to any of this ...there is so much corruption tied to Hillary it's overwhelming . If this was Trump they would have demanded his soul and total withdrawal from the election... No but Hillary gets away with everything SMH...
15 | Dorveen Duncan Rowan | 0 | 10154750075056336_10154750090831336 | WHERE is the Republican congress? WHERE is the RNC? WHERE is the Election Committee? WHY are they not investigating the voter fraud? WHY are the authorities not investigating the 16 states with voting machines connected to George Soros? He has ties to over 30 media outlets. I know the FBI and DOJ are in the tank for Obama/Clinton but where is justice in this administration...NOWHERE!
16 | Ed Kramer | 0 | 10154750075056336_10154750084521336 | Never Hillary! She is a lying corrupt cheater. She would bring the country to its knees inside of one year.
17 | Jeannie Hammond Fansler | 0 | 10154750075056336_10154750092246336 | She needs to be locked up pending her trial.  They have enough on her to put her away for awhile.  They all need stripped of everything they have because that is where our money is going.
18 | Shawna Compton | 2 | 10154750075056336_10154750084271336 | The fact that a presidential candidate that is a criminal suspect, being investigated by the FBI; is still allowed to remain in the race, it’s absolutely perturbing and dangerous to our Republic. Understand that if criminal Hillary Clinton, were to become the US President, we would be facing an unprecedented constitutional crisis that might be beginning of the end of the USA as the Nation where the rule of law and where the separation of powers prevail, and might be the start of a dictatorial tyranny.
19 | Maryanne McGinnis | 0 | 10154750075056336_10154750090951336 | D. Brazile has the nerve to say she knows what it is like to be persecuted? Oh please. Democrats need to get with it and admit the ride is over. The corruption has been uncovered and time to start telling the truth. From the top down.
20 | Johnny Renzulli | 0 | 10154750075056336_10154750089871336 | Another one bites the dust. When this is over it will look like a political graveyard. Donald won't even have to drain the swamp it will already be dried up!
21 | Chener Tango | 0 | 10154750075056336_10154750086341336 | she is going down fast to join the debbie wasserman schultz. lol. so who will be acting for the acting dnc chair haha
22 | Geoffrey McCloskey | 2 | 10154750075056336_10154750085331336 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...
23 | Shawna Compton | 1 | 10154750075056336_10154750083161336 | She still denying their emails ? Corruption to the core and Hillary and huma should go to jail ... CNN should be ashamed to be all in for Clinton like they have been !!
24 | Jeff Hawkins | 9 | 10154750075056336_10154750081086336 | No way!  I watched Ms. Brazile in an interview the other night and she swore up and down she didn't leak any questions.
25 | Craig Knecht | 0 | 10154750075056336_10154750083341336 | The DNC and Democraptic Party are full of corrupt, lying criminals.   Kennedy's party no longer exists, it is now the Radically Left Socialist Party of obummer and hilLIARy.

A man dressed as Freddy Krueger shot five people with a shotgun at a Halloween party over the weekend, San Antonio police said.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Aaron Bradwell | 201 | 10154749795361336_10154749908196336 | Aren't you going to report that over the weekend, more then 60 people were shot in Chicago, 17 of those shootings were fatal. I love Fox news, but all is I hear on this story is crickets.
2 | Zachery Neumann | 78 | 10154749795361336_10154749908636336 | sad that this happened and all... but his was kind of a predicted distraction from the Clinton scandals.... Seriously every time a new scandal of hers' come up, something tragic happens soon after.
3 | Stephanie Erskine | 67 | 10154749795361336_10154749907116336 | I swear with the way things are going Halloween is going to be canceled in the future...People are scared of clowns, offended by haunted houses and now some nutjob dressed as Freddy Kreuger shot 5 at a Halloween Party....For years I've heard people say Halloween is the devil's holiday and disrespectful to non-pagans...Don't be surprised when the Butthurt people get exactly what they want...
4 | Syed Hassan Rizvi | 100 | 10154749795361336_10154749887226336 | I don't want my taxes raised, I don't want to double our population with unlimited immigration, I don't want Syrian refugees here, I don't want the government in my everyday life, I want to take care of the American people first, I want our Military and Veterans taken care of also, I want the Constitution followed, I want waste and fraud eliminated, I want those who need it cared for, I want to eliminate welfare as a lifetime program passed from generation to generation, I want a healthy Social Security program, I want a robust economy, I want millennials to get a clue.This is why I will not vote for Clinton.
5 | Michelle Winkfein | 39 | 10154749795361336_10154749911446336 | LET THE DISTRACTIONS BEGIN!!!Make sure you go out and VOTE! Don't depend on the DoJ to keep Hillary out of the White House! WE have to UNITE to keep her out!!! 🇺🇸

8 | Mike Beaird | 8 | 10154749795361336_10154749958306336 | I guarantee there is going to be more shootings before the elections. Every time the liberal media wants to take the attention away from their candidate a mass shooting or terrorist attack just happens to occur. It's just a coincidence, right?
9 | Kahlor Krefting | 7 | 10154749795361336_10154749928926336 | Wait a shotgun? That can't be true. Everyone knows only semi-automatic black rifles can kill people. Was the shotgun black, that makes a big difference?

I have decided that since my kids are no longer mooching candy, I no longer feel obligated to pay back in kind, so no more celebrating Halloween at my house.
13 | Shenera Boodie | 0 | 10154749795361336_10154750025581336 | I'm sure it was a white man.....white men love  mass shootings.....they lose their jobs..they get a gun and shoot everyone at their jobs.....they get bullied at school...steal their parents guns and shoot everyone at their school....it never ends.,...lets count how many mass shootings in this country have been committed by white males......the mind of the white male.....scary
14 | Denise Brown | 0 | 10154749795361336_10154750022641336 | It's the underestimating of these costumes and the evil in our society. Next you'll see the purge crowd, you've already had the v crowd with those masks, now you'll have the Mr robot masks and the anarchists are out there with the Hoodia crowd masking and hiding their evil and getting away with it.

17 | Maido da Maxima | 2 | 10154749795361336_10154749956876336 | We were warned that distraction from the email scandal of Hillary in the next few days in form of;1. Murder2. Shooting of innocent black Americans3. A woman causing Trump of  sexim4. Etc and now they have one; if investigation are done it may have political connections to Hillary's games of mind.

20 | Jay De Pasquale | 2 | 10154749795361336_10154749976431336 | So a guy wore a mask and killed people...freddy never killed anyone with a gun...now if he killed them in their dreams then i would be concerned
21 | Laura Pease | 0 | 10154749795361336_10154749945231336 | James Day didn't you just post a meme about something like this happening in light of the new e-mail scandal regarding that women trying to be president.
22 | Mark Jones | 11 | 10154749795361336_10154749910911336 | "Two black males allegedly attended the Halloween party uninvited. Authorities say they started an argument inside the house and the homeowner asked them to leave."Sounds like some BLM terrorists were butt hurt for not being invited to a party.And some people still don't believe the leading cause of death among African American males ages 15-34 is murder. Just a fact folks.
23 | Alma Herrera | 0 | 10154749795361336_10154749974451336 | When Hillaryry becomes president thats what she will fight for...people that shouldn't have guns not to have them not to take everybody's guns away like trump has been telling the american people...so come on people get real VOTE HILLARY!!!
24 | Matt Crocker | 0 | 10154749795361336_10154749994696336 | I wonder if This is the diversion the media is going to spend so We the People forget about the FBI, reopening Hillary's investigation.
25 | Draco Edmonds | 1 | 10154749795361336_10154749980536336 | Oh come on people, if your going to attack people dressed as a horror villain at least put forth the effort to use the villains weapons.....

12 | Kerstin Straub | 4 | 10154749749061336_10154749826386336 | The elections should just start over. Clinton's  going down big time right now and Trump is not any better with his lawsuits coming up. He is as much criminal as she is. What happens if they both end up in jail?  Better to start new and give real politicians the chance. It's such a disaster all of it.
13 | Barbara Myrick | 7 | 10154749749061336_10154749801286336 | Oh look 👀👀👀!!!   All the Media Matters trolls are out in force this morning, we guess that their puppet masters are cracking the whip, get busy trolls, you have a lot of work to do, smearing Trump's character and looking like a bunch of brain dead zombies while doing it.Go head little puppets, spin, spin, spin!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂!!No matter how many lies you spew about Trump, you can never get away from the fact that the Clintons house of cards is getting ready to come tumbling down!!!  Yahooo!!   Couldn't happen to a better den of thieves, their crimes are coming home to roost!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
14 | Lois Hargrave Blackwood | 4 | 10154749749061336_10154749783561336 | Let's not be premature here. These are Weiner's posts, probably has a bit of porn selfies and other such. May not have anything to do with the Clintons, then again, it might be the missing link. Only time will tell.

16 | BF Love | 2 | 10154749749061336_10154749816841336 | I perfectly see that you Americans are believed other nations fraud election across the world and that's really cool. But as I have seen right now your American election is dictated by giant media(Fox news) and government institutions(FBI) that is really really makes you fool and elections foolish!!! I believe American peoples are intellectually rich and better than the others so please be genuine & Dump Thramp then elect the powerful women on earth because your coming president will affect the world by any means!!!
17 | Jane Navarre | 9 | 10154749749061336_10154749780101336 | Oh, but according to Martin O'Malley the server itself is to blame....give me and the rest of America a freaking break already.
18 | Jamarcus Gay | 2 | 10154749749061336_10154749793246336 | he still screaming about some dam emails we waiting to see your taxes and now we wondering why the fbi hasnt released info about the investigation on u and russia o i forget the head of the fbi is a republican he just trying to keep his job because he knows once hillary is in office he out of the job he loves dearly
19 | Gerry Hoehn | 1 | 10154749749061336_10154749850446336 | I think the FBI since they are in process of investigating, will be just as forthcoming as Hillary was, when they ask for her emails, that she deleted....This is all on her, hopefully what they found are the emails they thought they destroyed....this criminal can not be elected president, we would have a constitutional crisis.  And our government would remain corrupt to the core.
20 | Stacy Corbett | 3 | 10154749749061336_10154749892281336 | Its funny more people are worried what Trump has said but have no problem Hillary being a murderer, liar and being ok with Full term murder. But I guess criminals vote for criminals. I guess your afraid Trump may make jobs available and you might have to work and no more living off all us working people. I don't agree with either candidates but you have to choose one so Trump is a better choice. Educate yourself!!
21 | Meloney Martin | 2 | 10154749749061336_10154749949686336 | Hello everyone Trump could have 3 lawsuits. he could have been the biggest playboy. BEFORE he ran for president. NOW everything Hillary did was using OUR government to get rich as well as not caring about Americans who was fighting our enemy's. As well of putting all Americans at risk ( Probably Have) because of her stupidly of her e-mails. Then says she don't remember We can not have a president who can not remember what she did or didn't do.
22 | Jonathan Lawson | 2 | 10154749749061336_10154749836141336 | Hillary is scared!  That is why she is pushing early voting so much while Trump is just saying get out and vote on November 8th.  Sadly I see Obama pardoning her no matter what crimes she may have committed.
23 | Maritza Arroyo | 2 | 10154749749061336_10154749900831336 | Wow not surprised by the government's corruption.. I hope they indict all of them.  Stop lying to the American people.  Sorry Hillary you brought this on yourself.. oh wait was it all a video's fault? I'm sure the families of those killed in Benghazi would tell you the same.  You can run but you can't hide.
24 | Moti Gur | 0 | 10154749749061336_10154749952651336 | Unbelievable that Hillary is not in jail,  Federal Bureau of criminal Investigation against Hillary Clinton, FBI agents have found 650,000 emails on a laptop they believe was used by the husband of one of Hillary Clinton's aides, Huma Abedin.
25 | Arne Johnsen | 2 | 10154749749061336_10154749816756336 | A US navy soldier was imprisoned because he had six photographs of navy vessel he was on in 2009, the vessel was 40 years old, the government said it was classified material. Hillary used her private email server public when she was secretary of state, and delete 33k mail because she hiding something,   FBI say much classified material, but she goes free! This is too bad!

1 | Kelly Huskins Clemmer | 451 | 10154749595591336_10154749666291336 | This is crap! So if Hillary say , broke into a house , the FBI couldn't say anything because it might jeopardize the election within 60 days of the election!!! What is wrong with y'all ???? She's a criminal and they have evidence of that who cares what day it is ? Maybe he could go to lynch maybe she is involved maybe the emails show her involved in some way . He can't go to her if that's the case !!!
2 | Debbi Dalton Babin | 427 | 10154749595591336_10154749667231336 | Stop it! We can do it... November 8th! I'm tired of trying to explain to me teenagers how correct they are. They listen, but they don't really know! They are criminals and Liars both of them!! get them the hell out of Washington!
3 | Greg Merrill | 284 | 10154749595591336_10154749661546336 | Hillary Clinton is legally “disqualified from holding any office under the United States” due to her violation of U.S. Code Title 18 Part I Chapter 101 Section 2071. We demand that the United States Department of Justice act to enforce the law & indict her ending her presidential campaign & causing her to face up to three years in prison.The full text of the law is an follows:“Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States”.
4 | Ray Davis | 156 | 10154749595591336_10154749665426336 | Killary would not qualify to be a cashier at Walmart. But oh my goodness it's ok for her to run for president. Are we really this screwed up?
5 | Linda Burchette | 76 | 10154749595591336_10154749695436336 | If Bill Clinton had not interfered in the investigation in the first place or if Hillary and her puppets had not destroyed evidence we would not have this action today! Of course the Clintons , George Soros, dishonest media and donors are livid! Never held accountable before! Vote to rid America of this corruption!
6 | Linda Spizzo Karpowich | 69 | 10154749595591336_10154749676971336 | Wherever the Clinton's go there is always always always a scandal. if the months leading up to the election any indication of how the next four years with her in office why would anyone want her as president? if she is elected this will not stop. it will continue. people can also say well Trump too. I will not argue that point, but his has been about words. is  he squeaky clean...probably not. But we know he will surround himself with brilliant people. We already know Ben Carson will head up Health Care. Huma knew there was another device out there, any why didn't she turn that device in. And why why why do these two ladies surround themselves with such sleaze bags of husbands????? And people say Hillary is a role model for their daughters? Seriously? i have a 21 year old daughter no way would I ever ever ever want her to have a role model like Hillary!
7 | BrianBuffet Naturalbodybuilder | 36 | 10154749595591336_10154749683321336 | More troubling is that people are voting for all this . Just think what will happen if she wins .... Does anyone think this will stop ? Voting for more scandals and more corruption and more security issues? How can anyone trust her after all that she has done . She even lied about the origin of her own name . Can't believe people think she would actually be a good president after all her bad decisions she has made . Decisions that were all about her and how she could profit from them . Do people actually believe she cares about the country . Anyone who puts our national security at risk for her convience using a unauthorized server is someone who doesent care about the law. The reason these laws were written were to protect us from people like her that leave us vulnerable to foreign countries . Then to make matters worse deletes the enails after she was told to hand them over . She learned from watergate what to do , she knows that even though the destruction of the emails looks bad letting people see what she did would put her in prison .She lied repeatedly over and over again . Just can't understand how people can justify her actions .How can a person think that she will be good for this country , what possible traits does she have ? She makes bad decisions . Her track record in the Middle East speaks for itself . If she gets into office and continues to do the same crooked things then we have no one to blame but ourselves for putting her in that position . What a nightmare. Aren't we tired of the Clinton's yet ? Aren't we tired of hearing about Bill and his behavior and Hilliary and her scandals ? Other countries got to be thinking that we are a bunch of idiots ... The Clinton's are crooks and  are an embarrassment to society
8 | Peggi Calderaro | 20 | 10154749595591336_10154749751731336 | As much as I would like to believe this will open the blind eyes of the Hillary supporters, I won't hold my breath. They could find ten dead bodies buried in her backyard and the Dems would still vote her into office,
9 | Suzette Marie | 25 | 10154749595591336_10154749754671336 | Huma better get herself a personal body guard or she might end up having an "accident" like drop a barbell on her throat or mysteriously disappear and later be found in a park or some other fate like the other 46 people who were close to the Clintons who have died.... just saying..
10 | Bob LeBeau | 17 | 10154749595591336_10154749715811336 | Hillary you & your husband Bill did lie to Congress The FBI & to all of AMERICA You both should be in Prison! Is this what AMERICA is all about letting the rich people get away with what the poor can't? As Christians we are with Israel....
11 | Susan Conery | 3 | 10154749595591336_1266003600123792 | America is finally fed up with these scam artists who have served nothing and no one but themselves and their own interests for decades.
12 | Steve Callen | 5 | 10154749595591336_1800874796863705 | Funny thing, all of a sudden the Dems are screaming "violation of the hatch act...." But for the past three months I have heard all of them, Hillary Clinton included, make claims that 7 different federal organizations have linked Trump to the Russians and the DNC hacks.... If James Comey alerting congress of newly found evidence in a federal investigation is a violation of the hatch act... then what the hell would you call "7 federal organizations" informing Hillary and the democratic party that they were investigating Trump's links to the Russian hacks..and Hillary repeating that information in public 142 times in the last two months? It's REALLY funny, Hillary said "releasing information like that with so little details is strange, unprecedented, and down right troubling" , well, to that I say...what kind of details are there in " 7 federal organizations have linked Trump to the Russians and the DNC hacks"? Linked how Hillary? If there are links, bring them out, get it all out on the table, show those links...I find it strange, unprecedented and down right troubling that 7 federal organizations would release statements like that, with so little details. HYPOCRITE ALERT!!!
13 | Suzanne Carlisle Petty | 3 | 10154749595591336_1265984323459053 | Exactly #JudgeJeanine this whole scandal is crazy!! And why is someone running for president of the U.S. able to run while being investigated by the FBI??? So disgusted with the Clinton's thinking they are above the law!! Trump in 2016!
14 | Dennis Newhouse | 5 | 10154749595591336_10154749791526336 | You can probably blame this all on Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch little meeting they had and why this wasn't investigated more! Also I'm sure Obama had his little part in it all!Bunch of crooks!Drain the swamp!
15 | Claudia Gusler | 5 | 10154749595591336_1265995736791245 | Huma, from Saudi Arabia, is very active in her family business, promoting the Muslim Brotherhood. And she has access to this country's top secrets???  Hillary is very aware of this. Saudi Arabia gave millions of dollars to Hillary's campaign. Pay back is hell...for America!
16 | Jennifer Hajdics | 6 | 10154749595591336_10154749693396336 | If the new Clinton emails, which were found on a server not belonging to her, in an investigation into a politician sending pictures of his dick to a 15 year old NC girl contain Trump's tax returns, then I'll care.
17 | Bob Runkle | 1 | 10154749595591336_1800883370196181 | The FBI's credibility is on the line and if they don't clean this up President Trump will and I don't think their going to like that at all. In the mean time how can the Democrat Party continue to hawk this woman so consumed by controversy and scandal. Is this what we want for the next 4 years? Screw this! I'm voting TRUMP!
18 | Holly Roy | 7 | 10154749595591336_10154749699061336 | Take trump out of the equation and ask yourself. At what lengths will Hillary supporters defend her lies. Something like the OJ Simpson case. It is scary for our nation. Proof after proof of corruption and lies. Nation of sheep just waiting to follow this corrupt person over the cliff. Very sad
19 | Vicky Fratus | 7 | 10154749595591336_10154749685646336 | I was dodging sniper fire while on my way to a shovel ready job I was promised, when I heard the FBI re-opened the investigation into Hillary's emails. “Well, that’s just silly,” I thought. “Everyone knows it was a YouTube video that caused all this mess.” Poor Hillary. She just can’t get a break. Remember how she and her husband left the White House flat broke? I bet she thought she could keep her doctor if she liked her doctor too. Why, they’ve had to work real hard to make ends meet between giving speeches for $250,000 or more and all the charity work at the Foundation. I've heard Haiti loves the Clintons. Anyway, it’s just tough being Hillary - named after that famous mountain climber, you know. But really, folks, at this point what difference does it make? She’s admitted to not being technically gifted. She tried wiping her server with a cloth, what more can we ask of her? It’s not like anyone died under her watch, right?
20 | Daniel H Doxzen Jr | 1 | 10154749595591336_1800877850196733 | Nixon resigned, to spare the country a Constitutional crisis, while Clinton, after having been impeached, by The House, continued his presidency, and this is the difference between conservative republicans, and liberal democrats.
21 | Ben Quijada | 10 | 10154749595591336_10154749688071336 | Yep. And when the coward in WH pardons those "Arkansas grifters" as a welcome mat to the WH, we all can take pride in our Constitution, our democracy, our Republic. We did it to ourselves and our childrens future, tools for statism. WTF is wrong with all you Americans?
22 | Vicky Hickerson | 4 | 10154749595591336_10154749746701336 | Thank you Judge Jeanine Pirro for speaking up for the American people.  Stay strong and keep up the good work.  By the way, does anyone remember when George W. Bush took office he wanted to be able to communicate with his college student daughters on a private devise and they told him it would be public record/property.  I've been trying to search for the news article about it, but have not been able to find it.
23 | Bert Berkowitz | 8 | 10154749595591336_10154749675001336 | From what they're saying there are states that vote democratic every four years which tells me that if a Castro was a Democrat he could be elected president of the United States in those states.

6 | Terry Moshier | 487 | 10154740529116336_10154749603126336 | This is NOT the resting place of Jesus, as He is ALIVE and seated at the right hand of God in Heaven. Jesus AROSE and walked out of His burial tomb! He walked and talked with many for 40 days and then ascended into Heaven before their very eyes.
7 | Kristen E Stieger | 467 | 10154740529116336_10154749593836336 | Even though the tomb may be opened you won't find a body as Jesus arose from the dead and his body is no longer there. IF for some reason they say they find a body NO ONE should believe it as that would not be true. Get in your Bible's for the truth. God Bless.
8 | Joyce Ann | 288 | 10154740529116336_10154749568326336 | Ummmmmm..... isnt this WRONG ?!?  Why is this being disturbed ?  Not sure, but if the heavens open up and fire comes down.... I didn't do it....
9 | Denise Johnson Croft | 203 | 10154740529116336_10154749582546336 | As my husband point out, this statement is wrong. "The rock surface, or “burial bed” was hewn from the side of a limestone cave following Christ’s crucifixion, according to Christian tradition." It was a borrowed tomb, not made after the crucifixion.
10 | Ryan Folwell | 104 | 10154740529116336_10154749597056336 | And he isn't there because he is risen!! No other world religious figure can claim that distinction. Only Jesus Christ rose out of the grave because he is the Messiah!!
11 | Loida Amaro | 62 | 10154740529116336_10154749583471336 | Jesus is alive... there is no resting place as he lives!!!!!
12 | Mary Ann Riddle | 57 | 10154740529116336_10154749578541336 | The real story is...Jesus is not there anymore ❤️
13 | John Wright | 50 | 10154740529116336_10154749620291336 | You may have found the tomb, but you won't find the savior. He is on the right hand of the Lord! It is so good to worship a risen savior!

I understand there were horrible history that the christians have done but they are not welcomed as the idea on how a real christian should be.

16 | Lynn Baker | 22 | 10154740529116336_10154749605321336 | Joseph of Arimathea used his tomb to place Jesus' body .. three days later .. Jesus returned the tomb back to him ..rose and was seen alive by over 500 ... the resurrection of Jesus Christ can be read in the New Testament of the Bible
17 | Shawna Lynne Hoffman | 14 | 10154740529116336_10154749624856336 | Actually this is just one site where it was thought that Was Jesus' tomb. The church of the Holy Sepulchre is the Roman Catholic traditional site of Christ's burial. There is a second site called the Garden tomb that would be outside of the city limits during Jesus' time. Because Jews did not have burial sites within their cities and towns it is questionable of the validity of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher being the burial site since it would have been within the city. However there is so much history that is found with in these churches! I love appreciating all that the Church has to offer and learning from the history that has been preserved.
18 | Kathryn Iandoli | 22 | 10154740529116336_10154749613556336 | He has no resting place on earth. He is not here, he is with his Father in heaven. He rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.

In my life, it has always been the people with some kind of religious belief that have stopped and helped me when I needed it. Just honestly good, kind people. There's a song by Brad Paisley that I love called Those Crazy Christians that is a great description of that. "They look to heaven their whole lifeAnd I think what if they're wrong but what if they're rightYou know it's funny, much as I'm baffled by it allIf I ever really needed help, well you know who I'd callIt's those crazy Christians."
20 | William Leas | 9 | 10154740529116336_10154749633036336 | Just a slab of rock...big deal! Jesus was a Jew killed by the Romans but persecuted by the old Jewish Rabbis whom suspected there was something wrong about him! Maybe there was? But all the evidence has turned to dust long ago!

Soon he will make his appearance on earth again as it is written of him in the books of the old prophets and the book of the Revelation.

A massive manhunt for a suspect in a string of violent crimes, including the shooting of two police officers, ended in a police chase and shootout that left the man dead.

He was just a kid with his hands up, buying skittles, and they MURDERED him. Theys be tryna genocide us! Wake up white America, they're hunting us like animals!!! Statistics show that us whites are murdered by cops more than any other race! They're targeting us because of the color of our skin! #whitelivesmatter

11 | Ed Crenshaw | 0 | 10154749446771336_1067803866662500 | I come to this site of 💩kicking bigots to confirm that racist are still alive and well! You tell kids that racism is not as rampant but this site proves otherwise! A white killer was killed in a shootout with police a man who is known to have committed murder and was on the run! Many of the black men killed were NOT wanted for murder OR running from the cops! I did the job for 21 years and it's a tough job performed by brave men and women! But many of the recent shootings are not MORALLY justified! When reading these post can make me a person who was a cop as my father before me I cringe at the racist bigotry in defense of questionable police shootings! I would say go to Hell but I think karma will suffice!
12 | Michael Crouse | 15 | 10154749446771336_10154749504291336 | No offense, but now there is no need for 3 squares a day and wasting tax payers money. He got what he was asking for according to his premeditated actions.

14 | Dawna Huff | 5 | 10154749446771336_10154749560741336 | now let's cross our fingers and all of our toes that 🖕ing Hillary rotten Clinton the narcissistic lunatic that's running for president with the most corrupt record of anybody in the history of America to run for president that should not be allowed to run for president will get the same 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

A child playing with a toy gun in a park?A special needs assistant laying on the ground with his hands up pleading don't shoot?Or how about a man with a broke down vehicle with his hands up? If a person is walking around shooting innocent people, regardless of skin color they deserve to be gunned down. The revolt is more than than people of color being gunned down, it's also the justice system not doing their job for the victims.
17 | Tiberius E Collins | 3 | 10154749446771336_10154749578131336 | So angry .time for a white riot.  Called all my friends and woke the neighbors,  but everyone was going or had gone to work . Maybe we will just sit back and wait for the police to finish their investigation and do their job but we are all still angry . yup, we all agree we are angry at that white piece of trash breaking the law and endangering innocent people.

The mother of a U.S. Navy service member who was sentenced to prison time for mishandling classified information called out the "double standard" in her son's case compared to the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

2 | Stacy Darin Zepeda | 388 | 10154749364541336_10154749389196336 | This is just WRONG! Hillary keeps repeating Michelle Obamas phrase, "When they go low, we go high". There's a lot of truth to that. Hillary went so high, now she's above the law...and that's sad!
3 | L.t. Dean-Ausbun | 299 | 10154749364541336_10154749376471336 | There should be no Double Standard! #LockHerUp FBI don't drop the ball this time. Clean cut and justice for our Country and Benghazi!I'm voting #TrumpPence16
4 | Milton Hillgartner | 193 | 10154749364541336_10154749407706336 | Anyone with her years of experience in government would recognize by the contents of the email whether it should be marked as classified. If she can't by the time she was Secretary of State, then she has no business occupying the white house!
5 | CJ Del | 259 | 10154749364541336_10154749373706336 | That's the basis of this election. It's not just about if you like Trump. It's about if you like the current political system that separates the people from the politician. We are subject to different standards. The Clintons represent everything people hate about the elites and politicians. It is literally us (We The People) against them (the elites).
6 | Bill Boman | 91 | 10154749364541336_10154749412726336 | Bola Muyis, please watch this lady speak about the Double Standards between her Son and Hillary Clinton.  That's what I was telling you the other day WHY I believe she is guilty. This lady's Son is in Jail and Hillary is NOT! And they both committed the same crime, classified information on an unsecure devise.
7 | Wayne Merryman | 95 | 10154749364541336_10154749379866336 | If hilLIARy is PUT in office and America doesn't stand up to this blatant power grab, I predict domestic terrorism will skyrocket, IF we don't break out in a civil war.
8 | Raelyn Bowers | 76 | 10154749364541336_10154749388021336 | What happened to the Rule of Law in this country?

11 | Kelli Henderson | 18 | 10154749364541336_10154749381021336 | You can not expect the media to produce unbiased newsworthy material. Most have already been bought and paid for by either Clinton herself or her DNC puppeteers prior to her announcement of running for President. People must do their own research in order to make a sound vote, but that is even laughable.
12 | Dave Jennings | 17 | 10154749364541336_10154749467071336 | To Obama and the DNC Hillary can do no wrong, remember that Obama has released known terrorist from Gitmo, Hillary has accepted money from known terrorist harbouring countries. Obama chose to keep playing golf while Louisiana was under water. Hillary thinks it's OK to suck stem cells out of a unborn child who's heart is beating. And both ignored pleas for help for our soldiers and ambassador in Benghazi. So if you want 4 to 8 more years of nonsense like this then vote for Hillary, but remember what ever evil comes from it you own it.

15 | Christina M VanGinkel | 16 | 10154749364541336_10154749418246336 | The reason FBI Director James Comey came forward so late? he needed a subpoena to look at the emails and no one would authorize one (probably all afraid of  becoming one of the Clinton Dead)...he had to push their hand by going public!
16 | Amanda E. Connelly | 17 | 10154749364541336_10154749395861336 | Her supporters believe this is OK. They are 100% accepting of Hilary being treated as royalty because in their mind, she is royalty. They were never taught the Constitution and therefor have no idea why this is such a "big deal".

One parent said she plans to carry a gun while taking her sons around her Palm Bay neighborhood after two men were arrested last week for allegedly threatening people while dressed as clowns.

2 | Mollie Bentley | 118 | 10154749289776336_10154749299001336 | Some of the comments on here proves that we have more cowards than I thought and now I understand why so many supports or wants to vote for criminal Hillary Clinton!   Voting for Clinton doesn't make you look strong it only makes you look like a coward!  Oh, and Papy, you need to learn and write correctly!  Clinton had a lot of guns/power behind her to protect our Ambassador and Navy Seals but she too didn't have the courage or strength to do anything so she blamed it on a stupid video.  I just had to point that out!
3 | Carol Crocco Jones | 94 | 10154749289776336_10154749343646336 | If you are scared of clowns stay home. I am a big supporter of right to carry but I do not want a bunch of paranoid people with guns out and about. There will be clowns and boogey men. If you normally carry/ Carry On, if you are scared stay home or go to the mall.
4 | Mike Collada | 54 | 10154749289776336_10154749340816336 | And how many clowns will be shot by concealed carriers tonight? I'm gonna guess zero. It's called being prepared, not "trigger happy".
5 | Linda Comiska | 32 | 10154749289776336_10154749301066336 | I couldn't believe some of the scary clown masks I saw being sold and one guy was trying to get his daughter to buy one.  I wouldn't even think about buying those right now or ever really.  Hope no innocent clowns get shot and people aren't too paranoid and shoot anyone.  Sad that you have to worry about a night that should be fun for kids.
6 | Alice Corey | 37 | 10154749289776336_10154749333376336 | If you have to carry a gun to go trick or treating, you probably should stay home. And don't start yelling at me, I'm not anti-gun. But if you want to go clown-hunting, leave the little children at home.
7 | Dana En | 15 | 10154749289776336_10154749301951336 | People putting drugs and razor blades in candy, now people threatening kids while dressed as clowns, I think knocking door to door has been canceled.
8 | Lindsey Morrow | 16 | 10154749289776336_10154749349116336 | Lol... I love how people just eat up media hype. I think clowns are the least of our worries.. but gotta keep the story going somehow. Sounds like they are really grasping at straws here. Must be running out of "clown reports" of which about 98% were unfounded..
9 | Tina Gracey | 0 | 10154749289776336_10154749778316336 | What happened to just dressing up and having fun. Now everything has to mean something or even make fun of a person. I remember being able to walk with friends trick or treating now parents want to carry guns. If you feel that unsafe stay home buy the candy nov. 1 it goes half off anyway. Lets not take a life because of something like this.
10 | Pamela Arrington | 12 | 10154749289776336_10154749336501336 | If you are that fearful then please stay inside. You're right in that the U.S. Is not the safe country it once was but don't add to the problem by accidentally shooting someone or having someone shoot you because they are afraid. Stay home or gather with your friends or family.
11 | Jean Cassity | 2 | 10154749289776336_10154749485976336 | These dont look like clowns any more they look demonic. Big difference- the only reason to wear one of these masks would be to instill fear in people. If you find that fun you have a sick sense of humor
12 | Trevor Allen | 4 | 10154749289776336_10154749658946336 | I carry every day. If you're only going to carry when you're scared, please don't carry. I don't need an untrained worry wart to have a stray bullet hit my family or anyone elses.I'm all for the 2nd amendment and your right to defense but please be smart about it. You wouldn't let your teenager drive with the red Key to a hellcat. Don't start carrying with no training.
13 | Michael Lieving | 6 | 10154749289776336_10154749384356336 | This should not be news. The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution reads: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
14 | Carol Bensing | 1 | 10154749289776336_10154749522516336 | Since when is taking your kids trick or treating so important you need to arm yourself. If it's that dangerous why would you want your children involved. I wouldn't want my kids exposed to candy from just anyone in this day and age. Private parties are the way to go if you want your children to enjoy dressing up for Halloween or just take them to neighbors you trust and family only.
15 | Elisha Heffner | 8 | 10154749289776336_10154749315896336 | Oh yea so open fire around a bunch of kids so you can hurt or kill an innocent person. People will be dressed as clowns it's Halloween duh. Doesn't mean they are up to no good anymore them the next person
16 | ChrisMisty Abernathy | 0 | 10154749289776336_10154749448146336 | We did our annual Sweets on the Square where we live in our small, one redlight community. There were not one clown person, adult or child, dressed up this year. We won't play that way. It's not that we all were told not to we just have more sense and decency not to. It's went beyond being a creepy clown in some towns and thats a shame but any idiot that thinks it's funny to scare kids or adults that way should get what's coming to them. I carry as well and I would hate to take a life over something that could be prevented but if it came down to the safety of my child over a creepy clown then RIP idiot.
17 | Germaine Marie Whelan Drisdelle | 2 | 10154749289776336_10154749362036336 | Where in hell did politics come from arming yourselves to protect your children on Halloween obviously I missed something here hope you all have a safe Halloween & don't kill some innocent person
18 | Renée Mc | 3 | 10154749289776336_10154749332761336 | Halloween is the celebration of evil ... until our society became rebellious to authority, it was a day mostly for little ones to dress up and get their candy.  It's turned very dark in the past decade or more leaving parents to go out early and attend church functions.  Anyone out later than 8 or 9 are looking for trouble....Pray for law enforcement tonight and the innocent kids just out in tradition.  There's a new group that has no limits.
19 | Dawn Martin Gatlin | 0 | 10154749289776336_10154749916396336 | Recipe for disaster. I fully support a persons right to carry and protect themselves but what happens when you panic and try to shoot a clown and end up killing a defenseless child. If it's that scary and concerning then something else to do rather than trick or treating. Lots of organizations hold indoor events.
20 | Marie Weynand | 0 | 10154749289776336_10154749534811336 | If you feel that unsafe then just stay home and have a Halloween party at your house. Several years ago I felt unsafe opening my door to people in mask and costumes that were as big or bigger than my husband, so I just quit handing out candy. I do feel sorry for the little kids, but 19-20 y/o have no business out trick or treating.
21 | Glenn Boucher | 0 | 10154749289776336_1336536786365249 | And so begins the tragic end of Halloween.Someone most certainly is going to get shot tonight and quite possibly die and then we will hear no end of how he/she was a great and fun loving person who was only trying to have fun.
22 | Katelyn Griggs | 0 | 10154749289776336_10154749496881336 | Here's an idea, keep your kids safe and stay home. Have a little party at home. Bake sweets together, watch movies, eat candy. Or go to a church function. Our church does something safe for the kids every year. We stopped trick or treating a long time ago. We don't "celebrate" Halloween. Our local Chick-Fil-A is passing out free kids meals to children dressed in non-scary costumes. This world is too crazy now to take my kid door to door.
23 | Dave Schleusner | 0 | 10154749289776336_10154749668631336 | Why do all you talkers keep bringing up politics?, people are probably going to be shot and/or killed over something that they have been warned about for months, this is probably going to ruin the holiday for the future years because of some idiotic fad. This has nothing to do with either Trump or clinton.
24 | Tom Gertenhäuer | 1 | 10154749289776336_10154749398081336 | Not only should you arm yourself with something, but you should also know how to defend yourself without a gun or a knife, get trained in something like Krav maga, or any martial art,, not good to always have to rely on a weopon to defend yourself if you don't know how to defend yourself without a gun or knife your putting yourself at a disadvantage, Knives and guns are good, i carry a assisted blade on me everywhere i go, because with a gun there's always a chance ill miss, if they are close enough to me, im not missing with a knife but i can also hold my own without one, you should always have a alternative way of defending yourself incase you drop your weopon, or your gun jams and they get close range to you, what are you going to do if your gun jams and they get close enough range to you and they knock it out of your hand, your in trouble then if you don't know how to defend yourself without a weopon
25 | Teresa Romiti | 0 | 10154749289776336_10154749665296336 | Wow instead of arming yourself just keep your kids safe at home. People carrying guns around and possibly put your kid in risk of having to live with such horror. That would scare any child. Why on earth would parents be so irresponsible. No one who is paranoid should be carrying a gun out on a night where some scary looking people could be out playing around. Just stay home and keep your family safe. Don't possibly make your child have to live with a nightmare memory due to a non important holiday because people are paranoid and other people are doing evil. Stay home. If you think you have to carry a gun then you should do the responsible thing and keep your gun and your kid at home so you don't have to make your kid live with that kind of experience. Let's teach our kids to use our head correctly and make wiser choices. PLEASE!

Workers at a suburban Cincinnati Democratic Party headquarters came upon a smelly surprise Sunday morning, as a load of manure was found dumped at the door of their office.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Eric Glass | 2381 | 10154746683381336_10154749018346336 | This will be investigated with more intensity than the fire bombing of an RNC headquarters in NC.
2 | Frank Masotti | 1985 | 10154746683381336_10154749019041336 | Are you sure it was dumped, and didn't just come out of their mouth? We all know the Dems are full of sh|t :-)
3 | Dmarie Sotelo | 850 | 10154746683381336_10154749026586336 | The Democrats probably dumped it themselves so they have something to talk about.....
4 | Desiree Bailey | 417 | 10154746683381336_10154749029186336 | I don't agree with doing this kind of thing--but it does look like the Democrats were just cleaning house!!
5 | Sheri Vera | 244 | 10154746683381336_10154749145406336 | Finally, "the shovel ready jobs" that Obama promised!!! Seriously, the DNC probably put the crap there themselves to make republicans look bad and look like childish bullies.
6 | Timothy Mcauley | 208 | 10154746683381336_10154749031506336 | kinda like degrading a homeless black lady on trumps walk of fame star.liberals and the double standards.if that would have been a republican and a democrat black lady the words racist and feminist would have been flying all over CNN,MSLSD,THEVIEW,ABC,NBC.
7 | Sheila Quehe | 169 | 10154746683381336_10154749060131336 | Can't see where this is worse than DNC dumping raw human sewage waste from bus onto street in Georgia. This at least can be used as fertilizer on a lawn.  Also this was first reported 2 or 3 days ago !
8 | Frank Logan | 58 | 10154746683381336_10154749075096336 | Pacifist Republicans just couldn't bring themselves to the same level of VIOLENCE as Democrats in North Carolina who Fire Bombed the GOP Headquarters there.
9 | Ronald Brigman | 72 | 10154746683381336_10154749102836336 | This is not how our system is supposed to work. The fire bombing,the riots, and stupidity like this. We are better than this people, this is America. Don't let others push you to this level.
10 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 51 | 10154746683381336_10154749069241336 | Dems are panicking and then all of their dirty tricks are on full display --- calling names, innuendo, distraction, lying, spinning, excuse creating, blaming, temper tantrums, hissy fits, memory loss/amnesia, blaming others for what they are guilty of, bed wetting, hugging/biting their panic pillows, seeking solstice in safe spaces and OMG just acting like a kindergarten class of whiney 5 year olds ...... It is all the fault of other people or party.
11 | Glenna Obbink | 41 | 10154746683381336_10154749202281336 | I have the distinguished honor of being a member of the Committee to raise $50,000,000 for a monument to Hillary R. Clinton.We originally wanted to put her on Mt. Rushmore until we discovered there was not enough room for her two faces.We then decided to erect a statue of Hillary in the Washington, D.C. Hall of Fame.We were in a quandary as to where the statue should be placed.It was not proper to place it beside the statue of George Washington, who never told a lie, or beside Barack Hussein Obama, who never told the truth, since Hillary could never tell the difference.We finally decided to place it beside Christopher Columbus, the greatest Democrat of them all. He left not knowing where he was going, and when he got there he did not know where he was. He returned not knowing where he had been, and did it all on someone else's money.Thank you,Hillary R. Clinton Monument CommitteeP.S. The Committee has raised $2.16 so far
12 | Albert Smith | 42 | 10154746683381336_10154749064931336 | All though this is poor taste, it is hardly in the same category as a fire bomb. That's like comparing a burning bag of dog poop, to burning the house down and killing the family
13 | Greg Strochinsky | 30 | 10154746683381336_10154749212501336 | See, Republicans are funnier. Not necessary or appropriate but at least it doesn't cause permanent damage or put anyone's safety at risk.
14 | Marie Weynand | 22 | 10154746683381336_10154749079881336 | The DNC is so blasted corrupt I would not put it past them to have done this themselves. They are not above doing anything to try and take the negative talk away from their gal. What better way to get the media from talking about the latest email probe.
15 | Holly Hufstetler Denton | 16 | 10154746683381336_10154749150031336 | This reminds me of a couple of weeks ago when Hillary's DNC bus unloaded all its crap onto a sidewalk right outside of Atlanta...and then proceeded to say, "We didn't know that was illegal." They must have figured that since that excuse worked for HRC then it would work for them! 😡
16 | Bob Guzzardi | 14 | 10154746683381336_10154749213016336 | This kind of anonymous, petty vandalism does not advance the argument and like sign stealing. I think we need to focus on persuasion and selling our views, ideas and principles at a higher level than this.
17 | Gary Bell | 23 | 10154746683381336_10154749033191336 | I agree 100% with Michael Forystek...I'm a big conservative also but this is just plain wrong in my opinion... Very Disrespectful. As a Christian you should ask yourself would Jesus do something like this? That's right...the answer is NO!
18 | Pete Harsh | 18 | 10154746683381336_10154749056991336 | What a load of crap! Are you sure it wasn't dropped there from the DNC bus?
19 | Ginger Spelts | 25 | 10154746683381336_10154749075811336 | I am so sick of hearing Hillary blame everybody else for her mess. There are over 600,000 thousand state department and Hillary emails on a pervert's laptop. What is the FBI to do??Just ignore it...I don't think so. All she had to do was use the state dept.'s secured server and we would not have to be going thru this. She acts like it only affects her. It is affecting all of us. We are all having to go thru this, because of her being careless with our national security. She needs to stop blaming everybody else, take responsibility for her mess and own it!!
20 | Chris Mullins | 3 | 10154746683381336_1611991522436587 | hey! they destroy/ burn it to the ground! it,and they complaining! they talk X! it must be a refreshing smell while backing a criminal who smells like and acts like a peace of X!
21 | Dave Jackson | 8 | 10154746683381336_536592369872837 | This was clearly done by Democrats. If Republicans actually did this the manure would be dumped the other direction starting at the door...Stupid libtards
22 | Pamela Smith Wright | 3 | 10154746683381336_674106129429925 | I think there are a lot of issues at hand here. Mr. Trump needs to ask Obama if he is going to pardon Hillary & he needs to ask her if she will pardon herself as she CAN if she becomes POTUS & this needs to be asked before election so as people who haven't voted will know this. Because this is not right!! In all fairness she should step down We know if she steals this election she can pardon herself.
23 | Dwayne Klien | 0 | 10154746683381336_1762313707339922 | Looks like the pile has grown since first reported, must be all those lies Hillary is telling to elude this latest FBI investigation, the manure just keeps coming out of her mouth or could Reid and Pelosi have added to it.
24 | Daniel Frusco | 2 | 10154746683381336_10154749123411336 | They had info back at the last election Obama even stated he was going to leak e-mails out look it up. So the FBI had 4 years to investigate it was not untill  wikelinks rolled do they now start to investigating. So Hillary can shouth up this is not new stuff it on going just thanks to the leaks has brought it to the stage.
25 | Mariellen Dalton | 5 | 10154746683381336_10154749183966336 | How nice. This is an example of an election gone wrong. I've never since so much hate. I have never seen so many friends become enemies. Neither candidate is the best America has to offer. The next four years are a disaster for all parties. At this point most of us just want it over.

Ninety percent of Hispanics who primarily speak Spanish identify as Democrats, but of those who mostly use English that number drops to 59 percent, according to a Pew Hispanic Center survey.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jason Robinson | 720 | 10154747128426336_10154748879606336 | That's because those who speak English are interested in assimilating, embracing the general values and standards of the United States and aren't limited to getting their news and information from the socialistic crap that's pumped out on Univision.
2 | Uchenna Godwill | 410 | 10154747128426336_10154748865581336 | Just in: Clinton is now LEADING in polls in important battleground states, such as Qatar, Iraq, Iran, and Syria And hopefully soon...San Quentin#NeverHillary
3 | Debbi Dalton Babin | 354 | 10154747128426336_10154748871916336 | So done with these stupid polls. I live in Florida my neighborhood is 80% Hispanic. They have a mind of their own and they're voting for Trump!!!!
4 | Rod Sklar | 128 | 10154747128426336_10154748871096336 | Lets vote for obama and Hillary Clinton so we can import millions of Muslims, and take away guns from Americans, the liberals will never wake up and see the truth. Vote for trump, to make America great again !
5 | Travis Lloyd | 139 | 10154747128426336_10154748877501336 | Now isn't that interesting; the ones who've actually learned English and decided to become productive members of society are more inclined to vote for Trump - who'da thunk it?
6 | Mauricio Cretin | 95 | 10154747128426336_10154749105286336 | That's because the Spanish channels like Univision and Telemundo are Democrat channels and they run nothing but Republican hate ads. So if you only speak Spanish=only watch Spanish TV=you grow up thinking Republicans are automatically bad people. smh
7 | Lynne Sarduy | 72 | 10154747128426336_10154749298656336 | I as an American whose family had to flee Cuban dictatorship and communism could never understand why  latinos vote for the same type of people that they fled their own countries for.
8 | Jerry Ray Baskerville | 59 | 10154747128426336_10154748871281336 | •	Illegal Immigration: One would think that all those who immigrated to America “Legally” would be as incensed as those “Legal” immigrants that I speak to are! Why? Legal immigrants apply, show that they have the resources to pay their own way so that they are not a drain on the taxpayer, have NO Criminal Record, have a bona-fide sponsor and a bona-fide job! They then wait for 18 months to several years for their Green Card! Why then is it OK to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees and also allow illegals to jump to the front of the line? Use your head people!
9 | Deb Hernandez | 40 | 10154747128426336_10154749295441336 | Untrue. Did you see the turnout at Trump's rally's in Colorado and New Mexico? We are full of hispanics / latinos in both states! Surprise visit  from Trump last night here in Albuquerque and the hangar at Atlantic Aviation was jam packed with thousands of hispanic / latino voters  "energized" to see Trump even while the Dallas Cowboy/Philadelphia Eagle game was on!!! That study is very, very wrong!
10 | Kaiya Alaniz | 11 | 10154747128426336_10154749076966336 | They don't speak English so they rely on those who do to be truthful with them about the candidates. Apparently the dems see free votes, much as they do with the dead, and so they steer them to their lying, murdering, thieving candidate. Yet another reason that citizenship and identification should be required before someone is allowed to vote. The number obviously drops sharply the more English they speak.  I do not know where they conduct these studies, but I know fewer Hispanics that are voting for h.c. than those who are voting Trump.  One thing is sure, this Hispanic is definitely voting for Trump!
11 | Virginia Gi | 27 | 10154747128426336_10154749184156336 | I am a working Latina single mother. I raised my son to have conservative values, to be independent, to work for what he wants, to earn what he deserves. In other words, not a democrat. We don't watch Univisión/Telemundo. And we voted for Trump.
12 | Brandy J. Hughes Gordon | 15 | 10154747128426336_10154749008576336 | I do not know how we'll ever combat problems in these United States when the media is so bias.Trump spoke of coyotes who rape and are criminals, the media took that and ran with it stating Trump believes all Mexican people are criminals. He wants to get violent  criminals who've come here illegally back to their countries and start to address the illegal immigrants in the US, media reports he'll be sending in military or other to gather some 2 million illegal immigrants and take them back to their country. That's impossible to begin with.Trump has said to become right with this country and praises those who become citizens, who are here legally. He's never said anything bad about legal immigration, not once.I had new friends over the other day. A married couple, she has been here her whole life and her husband from Mexico, a Hispanic couple of over a decade. She knew nothing of Hillary and knew Trump hated her for being Mexican, he hates us. Didn't even know Hillary was a racist calling her vote "the taco bowl"People I have on my fb call him racist. No one seems to care what he's getting at or trying to do as far as msnbc and other "news" outlets go. They just want to distort and contort words all the while praising Hillary as their one! She's not going to change a thing! You'll be paying more to the government, food out of your children's mouths. Obama has deported 10 million people. She's for vetting and stronger boarders. Trump says it and everyone loses their mind. The truth is, stronger boarders does not mean we're raging against a certain people, stronger boarders would keep us all safe.
13 | Carlos Cruz | 6 | 10154747128426336_10154749263836336 | The term "Latino" is like a unicorn, it really does not even exist.  People with Spanish surnames come from many different countries, with different enough cultures, of different races (white, black, native american and mixed) and they do not all think the same way.  Try calling all people with English surnames "Anglos" whether they are white, black, mixed, from Alaska, Alabama, Jamaica or the Bahamas, and you will have the same unicorn.  You really should stop using the term "Latino" as it is vague and thus useless.  And the term "Hispanic" should be reserved for those that are predominantly European (from Spain), because a last name obtained from the slave owner or the converter to Christianity does not make a person Hispanic.
14 | Michael Duff | 11 | 10154747128426336_10154749112151336 | The Democrats controlled the house and Senate and the President a few years back when Obamacare was passed. No way could the Republicans stop it, if the wanted to pass immigration reform they could. They didn't. Why would people vote for the Democratic Party?
15 | Ben TI | 13 | 10154747128426336_10154749233116336 | This Legal African immigrant  also have a mind of his own and voting DJT. My greatest surprise in America was to find out that African American are mostly liberal totally  contrary to our value, believe in God, against abortion, hard work should pay, and fiscally conservative. I don't know what Democrat put in their mind.
16 | Blake Halbert | 5 | 10154747128426336_10154749114516336 | It's because they dont know any better. They are lied to and even threatened by democrats, threatened with jail and imprisonment if they don't vote Democrat. This sort of thing happens all the time in business dealing with Mexicans. They don't understand our legal system and people here often use that to their advantage.
17 | Alan Castle | 4 | 10154747128426336_10154749132846336 | It`s an easy decision. Voting one way leads to lots of Muslims in America ( they hate everyone and even themselves apparently ). The other way preserves the right to better yourselves, move where you wish and the right to choose your faith. Which one is your choice and live with it.
18 | Priscilla Kenyon | 8 | 10154747128426336_10154749329586336 | I am mixed race black and hispanic and my whole family speaks English. In saying that they are all Dems except me I identify as a Conservative Republican. I wish they would see the light 🙄
19 | Davey Koch | 9 | 10154747128426336_10154748923041336 | Interesting, in that Hispanics that speak English are less likely to be "Democrats".. Can the non English speaking Hispanics actually make a well informed and educated decision on this?? 🤔
20 | John Branton | 23 | 10154747128426336_10154748867696336 | Makes sense. You learn the language and realize what lying scumbag Hillary is.
21 | Nathan Deplue | 20 | 10154747128426336_10154748867151336 | OBAMA is a devout Muslim with ties to the Muslim brotherhood,his half brother has confirmed it...he has refused to protect this country while playing dictator at the same time, he holds office illegally due to the face he wasn't even born in America, he is a shill for the globalist to bring down western culture with radical islam, he has aided and given asylum to terrorists, he has stated the USA should give up it's sovereignty for U.N. control, this man is a parasite to the highest degree, anyone supporting this race baiting traitor should leave the country immediately.
22 | Eric Vestri | 14 | 10154747128426336_10154749155166336 | The illegals want the Democrats because they will be able to stay. English speaking hispanics are typically here legally and understand how we can't even take care of our own people, let alone more illegals, so they switch to the party that is trying to save this country.
23 | Flordemar Aguilar | 6 | 10154747128426336_10154749300171336 | Hispanics who dont speak english claim to be democrats because democrats have bought the media and people get influense by the stupid media, one of those examples is the "so famous" journalist from Univision, Jorge Ramos he is always telling people how good Hillary is and how she is going to legalized everybody just like Obama said he would wich is just a bunch of crap. I am ashamed of my own people because they are being used by this criminals. All they  talk about is what Trump said, well guess what? It doesnt bother me because i am not a criminal, and like it or not a lot are what trump said only problem is that because of some bad apples we all get blamed
24 | Glenda Ramirez | 5 | 10154747128426336_10154749456121336 | Did you notice, that the ones who speak English, are Republican. The newly arriving are democrat,That is concerning,they can't be citizens,and eligible tovote.We need to  show I'd. I  bought  cold medicine, last week and  had to show  ID.
25 | Daniel Wilken Arzanegui | 5 | 10154747128426336_10154748896566336 | Just in. Clinton isnt being investigated you twats. Emails not on her computer or server. 2ndly those numbers mention above are still shocking for Trump3rdly. Clinton starts November 8 with probably 258 electoral votes. She only needs to win 2 swing states. 4thly. She isnt going to prison...so give it up.

"I don't believe when Director Comey says that he's going back to look at this other server that Anthony Weiner had -- I don't believe that amounts to the fact that Hillary Clinton is under criminal investigation again." – Martin O'Malley

2 | Betty Galloway | 608 | 10154746532091336_10154748820276336 | Yes America, Martin O'Malley really is that dumb. I'm from Maryland, can you believe we managed to get through his administration alive!
3 | Preye Ralf Konyefa | 271 | 10154746532091336_10154748828911336 | Martin O'Malley i used to respect you thinking you were far better than all this, but i guess i was wrong. And oh, if Martha Stewart could go to jail then so should Hillary, just pointing out
4 | Robbie Roubique | 203 | 10154746532091336_10154748794906336 | It's just ashame that if someone other than her had done this they'd be rotting in prison and she's running for president and most likely will unfortunately win...
5 | Susan Bailey | 162 | 10154746532091336_10154748811911336 | These liberals are stretching to find an alibi for Clinton and lying about Trump to try and change the subject. The only thing they are accomplishing is making themselves look ignorant and void of all moral and ethical compass.
6 | Lawrence Webster | 146 | 10154746532091336_10154748816936336 | O'Malley is delusional.And a weak,wimpy politician. He was the one who allowed Black Lives Matter to shame him into not saying "All Lives Matter" .Sad and pitiful.
7 | Dan Jacobson | 90 | 10154746532091336_10154748802071336 | Another corrupt person in a rigged system. Of course he thinks she's not under investigation. Gee George which way did he go?
8 | Rachel McGilvray | 75 | 10154746532091336_10154748800976336 | Martin O'Malley is a sponge ball of Democratism. He lost his Candidation so  big league, he feels impelled to protect Hillary.

Protect them from snares and attacks of the enemy, for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Send angels to guard them, guide them, and protect them. Fill their day with joy, strength, and your wisdom. Anoint Donald and Mike and all who hear their message with the Holy Spirit so that they may touch everyone with understanding and feel their hearts just like you did in Pentecost. Motivate them to go out and vote. In Jesus Christ we pray. Amen!
10 | John Seldon | 51 | 10154746532091336_10154748805331336 | Seems like they're having to dig pretty deep to find someone willing to defend her. Trotting O'Malley out to defend her honor is about as desperate an act that I can imagine.
11 | Craig William Stiffler | 48 | 10154746532091336_10154748797901336 | Hillary has spent her entire life attempting to avoid blowback from a rogue weiner – her husband’s. Who would have ever thought her presidential campaign would be laid low by another rogue Weiner?
12 | Mickey Burrøw | 38 | 10154746532091336_10154748802821336 | Mr. O'Mally, do you not know what it means to be have something being examined by the FBI?  Its an investigation. And did you not read the memo written by Comey to Congress. If it squacks like a duck and looks like a duck, let me guess, you think its a chicken.
13 | Kathy Osteen | 33 | 10154746532091336_10154748867946336 | I cant wrap my brain around 650,000 emails!!! I think anthony weiner saved everything as an insurance policy for himself!!! Hopefully all of these idiots who support clintons will soon be silenced and the evidence will be refutable and clear and concise for convictions!!!
14 | Soumen Barua | 17 | 10154746532091336_10154748800331336 | "...this other server that Anthony Weiner had...", Weiner didn't have a server, he had a laptop that was shared by Huma. Sheesh, some people. Huma probably backed up her emails or some point decided to work off line with saved emails. Either way thanks to Huma somehow Hillary's DELETED emails got downloaded on the hard drive of Weiner's pc. Just imagine Melanie was put on fire because of some bs speech my Michele Obama for plagiarism and here there are literally 10s of thousands of deleted emails from Hillary to Huma probably forwarded or CC'd to Huma for further action.
15 | Eric Zerface | 16 | 10154746532091336_10154748859161336 | Think about it this way folks. If Edward Snowden had done only what she did he would have lost his clearance, lost his job and been charged with espionage and more than likely be sleeping in Leavenworth with others like him.  Why does she get a get out of jail free?
16 | Fred McBain | 19 | 10154746532091336_10154748808881336 | I think this is just one more example of the need for server control to stop server violence! We should follow the example of other countries that have tough server control laws or ultimately just make it illegal for high-level government officials to have their own private servers! oh yeah that's right, it's already illegal!
17 | Martin Gifford | 15 | 10154746532091336_10154748834936336 | Huma has all the emails Hillary destroyed.  This is high treason. Do your jobs, were so completely sick of this. Regular people laugh at all of you. What a freakshow.  Some hippy grows pot and does time, this piece of work started ISIS- daesh. Russia, Syria, Jordan..long list going to have us in International court unless you all man up.
18 | Richard Todd | 19 | 10154746532091336_10154748797876336 | Chat Conversation Start196K people like thisMedia/News Company12:01amBarbara Boxer, one of the senators from California announced last year she was going to retire and not seek re-election. So we were going to have a new senator for the first time in decades...but the party of which this person would belong was already chosen.Are any of you aware that the state changed the law (and I think the state constitution) governing elections and for THIS election the law now states that it is no longer the winner of the primary from each party that will run in the general election. But now it is the top two vote getters regardless of party.Thus, the Socialist Republyk of Kalyphornia officially killed democracy within the state and turned it into a mini USSR and guaranteed that the next new senator was democrat as well as the Lt. Governor.So, when me and my fellow peasants in this Socialist Utopia go to the polls in two weeks to not only elect POTUS but a new senator we have a very difficult choice to make. Democrat or Democrat.Just like the Communist party in the old Soviet Union, California's Democratic party will be receiving 100% of the votes for senator and Lt. Governor.The sad part is, democracy died in California and nobody noticed. Nobody is saying a word. Not even Fox News

20 | Dawn Sera | 8 | 10154746532091336_10154748858366336 | Shut up in Jesus name! Do any of you ever report the truth, why would I comment what I think about you when I don't even know if you're lying or not? I am sick of the media lying, you have an obligation to tell us the truth, and if you don't you need to lose your job. I think the American people deserve truth and not your "trickery and deceit" especially on October 31st. please do the Americans a favor and report responsibly and accurately. This is why I believe Trump and not the media!

What people will do at the sacrifice of others family. There is already enough pain and humiliation being placed on this mother and child. How heartless you all are!!

22 | Jeremy Hall | 19 | 10154746532091336_10154748800046336 | Ponder this.... For some reason you ask to see your spouse's phone, and they refuse, but proceed to frantically thumb through pushing buttons. You ask again, and they drop the phone into your pets water bowl.. Whilst slowly retrieving the phone from the water bowl it slips from their hands and falls to the floor.. Your spouse then kneels to the floor and accidentally cracks the screen with their knee.............  You are left there speechless, and they say (as they pick up the pieces of the broken phone), "honey, if i had it to do over again, I would have done something different.."Are you.......A. a little bit suspicious?B. Fully trusting their every word?C. Reluctant because they are a model spouse?D. Livid because they must be hiding something and the evidence is gone?I trust my wife but i have to admit.. It smells pretty fishy to me..It's hard to believe that The Clinton Camp is pointing fingers at FBI director, James Comey, claiming he BROKE the law.. read that again!!! If that's not the pot calling the kettle "black," I don't know what is!!....... makes me hot!!! They signal the Hatch Act of 1939...  They are claiming that Comey is influencing the election.. WRONG!! Hillary is merely reaping what she has sewn!! This is called, consequence, repercussion, and JUSTICE!! If they crucify him, and she gets off Scot Free, it would only define the terms "TYRANNY and HYPOCRISY!!" Here's the deal..... A. IF YOU BREAK THE LAW, YOU PAY THE PRICE!!!B. SHE IS DEFLECTING ONCE AGAIN!!! PUTTING ATTENTION ON COMEY INSTEAD OF HERSELF.C. IF SHE WANTED TRANSPARENCY, SHE WOULD HAVE FULLY COMPLIED AFTER THE SUBPOENA!D. SHE IS NOW BUTTHURT BECAUSE IT CAME BACK TO HER AT THE MOST INCONVENIENT TIME!!E. #KARMAF. IF YOU SWIM IN THE SWAMP, BY GEORGE, YOU'RE GONNA STINK!!!All she had to do was be "transparent," by releasing the information when she was subpoenaed!!!! If there was nothing there, then there was nothing to hide.. But no, she destroyed every last piece of evidence there was!! Does this not signal a problem?? I feel bad for Comey.. I think he was pressured to sweep it under the rug, because he was trusted by both parties... I think he wrestled with his conscience for a while, even after he learned of the new evidence, but this is his redemption.. He is in clear conscience.. HE IS NOT INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO THROW THE ELECTION. He just wants the public to know the #truth.Leftists automatically scream #taxreturn when we demand #emails ...  I honestly doubt Trump broke any laws on his tax returns.. Perhaps there are discrepancies in there, and perhaps he may have exaggerated bits.. I guess we shall see.. #comeyisapatriot
23 | David A Long | 11 | 10154746532091336_10154748865496336 | Hillary Clinton is totally corrupt. The Democrat and media machine are fully exposed in deception and disinformation. Hillary's crimes are disgusting. Why is she not in prison yet?
24 | Mary Ann Chandler | 5 | 10154746532091336_10154748946851336 | Who cares about Weinergate? James Comedy is just as crooked as Hillary....This entire reopening is just another one of Hillary's schemes to get the peoples' minds off of wikileaks....Nothing will come out of this and Hillary knows it....Maybe HRC has hired the "Hacks?"
25 | Dan Alan Sinema | 3 | 10154746532091336_10154749049351336 | O'Malley is a true believer and will say anything to exonerate Clinton. He will say that it is dark, even in the brightest light, if it will help Clinton. He is just another liberal hypocrite hoping not to lose power.

For 10 years now, the NFL has played at least one regular season game in London. This year England’s capital will host three games -- and four games next year.

3 | Greg Pierce | 25 | 10154747013016336_10154748747491336 | They had better be careful...Every Indian tribe in the US will be protesting their attire! It's a travesty to do or use any Native American patented clothes, face painting, mocs, pony tails, tobacco, tee-pee gambling, or use of any name associated with indians, unless they get paid, then it's OK!P.S.

4 | Stanley S. Thornton | 34 | 10154747013016336_10154748722421336 | Are they aware there is already a European Football League that plays American football, and has been since 1986?

THE NFL CAN SUCK IT.
6 | Brian Bruce | 37 | 10154747013016336_10154748723921336 | If fans dressed like that in America, it would cause an outcry of racists and cultural appropriation.

8 | Rob Griffin | 4 | 10154747013016336_10154749152446336 | You won't see any British football players showing disrespect when their stadiums play the British national anthem, "God Save The Queen."
9 | Adam Villarreal | 5 | 10154747013016336_10154749307276336 | Still boycotting the NFL and to remove any doubt as to why, it's over the silence by the NFL over the kneeling by players during our National Anthem.  At this point, won't be watching NFL football again as I have found new things to do during this free time.
10 | Matthew S. Fuzi | 6 | 10154747013016336_10154748754691336 | Why are people on this forum so heated over this? Obviously there's a growing interest in the sport across the pond, and the NFL is helping to facilitate that whilst bringing in foreign revenue and reaching out to international investors.If it's because you think this is an "American" tradition and you think that other cultures aren't qualified for it, you don't sound like any patriotic sports lover I know; you'd just sound like a backwards redneck...Now, don't get me wrong, I do loathe the NFL as an organization for several reasons, but taking advantage of growing markets abroad is not one of them. Simply put, that's what any producers would rationally do, according to the Law of Supply.
11 | Jeff Cook | 3 | 10154747013016336_10154748814886336 | I doubt that American Football/ Gridiron will ever catch on to the degree that baseball, basketball, and ice hockey have.3 major world sports from North America is quite impressive (considering the time frames involved), but don't hold your breath waiting for the NFL to make it 4.
12 | Michael Crouse | 5 | 10154747013016336_10154749305736336 | So since the NFL allows disrespectful players to dis' our National Anthem suffering major fan loss ... they think that taking games away from American fans and shipping them over seas is the answer?

I actually felt a little different after yesterday's game now. (Even if we tied....grumble. LOL!)
14 | Feonis Washington | 0 | 10154747013016336_10154749433501336 | well it is slow. It is fed slow. Soccer in the United States has been a 35-40 year build.Soccer today is much bigger than 1970's, 1980's. World Cup in the 90's was a good test of interest. MLS is doing really good.The failures seem to be many indoor soccer leagues, arena soccer, gimmick soccer. Similar to arena football, WWE football (cannot remember the name). Those are the short lived and quick failures that dampen the movement.I love both sports, but even though The USA hosted a World Cup, please do not have a Super Bowl there.Not everything needs to be a plug & Play mentality.
15 | Steve Hanke | 0 | 10154747013016336_10154749555256336 | Wonder if players will stand for playing of God Save The Queen? That is rather anti -American based on our history yet being respectful. Trump should trade the NFL to England for New Found - Land. NFL for NFL.
16 | Robert DeLong | 2 | 10154747013016336_10154749305336336 | I was a avid NFL watcher, but no more, two reason I don't watch, 1. Monday night football, thursday night, You have too subscribe to the nfl network how you have to pay for it, (NFL money crubers) the NFL let there player go political, and not evenly political (one team not allowed to support police), those players I thought depend on the fans for their income. I defend the right to protest, but when I turn on my TV and protest are where I am made to watch the protest, I decided to let the over paid thoroughbreds Whine I will not watch The NFL any longer.

19 | MA LA Allen | 0 | 10154747013016336_10154749646496336 | It's nice the NFL is visiting London for marketing purposes, cause it's not because the English like football.   If they liked it that much.. let them fly over here, and get tickets like everyone else...  And, play that game on a Saturday, so Americans don't have to get up at 5 a.m. to watch an American sport.
20 | Ricky Lynch | 2 | 10154747013016336_10154748804931336 | If you’re over 35, take a walk down memory lane—you won’t believe what you have forgotten. If you’re under 35, read on—I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care.Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection.After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations.She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply.She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation.Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense.Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . .She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?)After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?
21 | Angela Dwyer Bach | 0 | 10154747013016336_10154749408121336 | Well with down ratings in the US they will have to start expanding in foreign markets. Plus why not ship jobs overseas and take away American jobs. That's what we do in America.
22 | Kevin Bourguet | 1 | 10154747013016336_10154748756881336 | I don't see the point, other than the fact that the seats are probably more expensive in London than in Midwest and West cities. I feel bad for fans who live on the West Coast, such as the LA Rams the other week.
23 | Ryan Cooke | 0 | 10154747013016336_10154749533731336 | What if we just send the NFL over there for good?  Ratings are down in the states.  Players disrespet the law and the flag.  It's unwatchable.

A Russian Soyuz space capsule has landed in Kazakhstan, bringing back three astronauts from the United States, Japan and Russia back to Earth from a 115-day mission aboard the International Space Station.
--------------Comments:--------------

Hillary could win the election, get indicted, turn over the presidency to Tim Kaine and he appoint Elizabeth Warren as his VP. To make it even more complicated, if this happens before the election is certified by all the states, the Speaker of the House would be President. And that my friends would be Paul Ryan.

18 | Bryan Stclair | 2 | 10154747048436336_10154748839361336 | Thinking of voting #Hillary, think again;⚠If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?👁⚠If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.👁⚠If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.👁⚠If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.👁⚠If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.👁⚠If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.👁⚠If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?👁⚠If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much!

Am I the only one that is bothered by this? How many other presidential candidates have been under investigation prior to the election but because it was less than 60 days they didn't do anything?
21 | Liz Johnson | 0 | 10154747048436336_811039259036572 | Look if the FBI didn't fine anything on Hillary Clinton they definitely would not have reopened her case! So even if they have Anthony Weiner's  and Huma emails Hillary Clinton is involved in those emails it's pretty much common sense! And when Hillary Clinton and the Democrats Party says to release the emails and put it on the table I'm sure the FBI will release the emails as soon as they review it and the FBI will do it whenever they're ready to do it!

But you and Bill will still make a living.... you left the White House "broke".... and in 8 years you are once again Millionaires!! So do what you do but don't include American Lives in your schemes!!!! Retire Hillary!!!

Stand up and vote and prove that we have a voice that deserves to be heard.
13 | Karen Massie | 8 | 10154746310261336_10154748554441336 | How, in good moral and ethical conscience, can anyone vote for #hillaryclinton?  She's being investigated by the FBI twice in 6-months!
14 | Andrew Williams | 9 | 10154746310261336_10154748508741336 | What's happening is so unbelievable, our government is so corrupt. We have turned a blind eye for to long. GOD bless us in this election and the years to come. Its so hard to believe we are where we are at. We find ourselves in this situation due to a corrupt media, there will always be corrupt politicians but a honest media would have found out Clinton long ago. Heads in the media need to roll.
15 | Dennis Dupuy | 5 | 10154746310261336_10154748570886336 | Anytime they are caught on the short end, OR they are lying, they began to smile or laugh. Watch for yourselves. Happens EVERY time.
16 | Jan Kobus | 6 | 10154746310261336_10154748519431336 | The Clinton campaign is a sinking ship! If by a miracle she did win this election, her first several months would involve her being under investigation and ultimately criminally charged!
17 | Hugo Duenas | 3 | 10154746310261336_10154748747826336 | The following letter addressed to Donald Trump I am sharing with you was written by a lady on another page. She asked readers to share it... feel free to do so... My open letter to Trump supporters. I know it is long but please read and take a second to think about it. The future of this country depends on it. Feel free to share! So You Want Someone To ‘Tell It Like It Is’? OK, Here You Go. 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin's puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals.3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade's cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said “ I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks.” Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person.4. You say you're patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution's limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin...etc5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton's history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can't ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional.8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem?9. I agree 100% if she's elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people’s money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home?11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin's little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right's anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country?12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said "Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,” and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillary's reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as "super-predators" in 1996? I don't agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don't care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.
18 | Daniel Frusco | 0 | 10154746310261336_10154749117911336 | They had info back at the last election Obama even stated he was going to leak e-mails out look it up. So the FBI had 4 years to investigate it was not untill  wikelinks rolled do they now start to investigating. So Hillary can shouth up this is not new stuff it on going just thanks to the leaks has brought it to the stage.
19 | George Shields | 0 | 10154746310261336_1243948915661771 | Now just think. If Hillary would have just turned over her server a year ago we wouldn't be here. If Hillary wouldn't have deleted a minimum of 30,000 emails we wouldn't be here. If Hillary would have been truthful with Congress relative to the number of devices she used we wouldn't be here. If Hillary would not have hired a firm to acid wash her devices and server we wouldn't be here. If a bunch of her attorneys wouldn't have used hammers to smash a bunch of devices we wouldn't be here. If Bill had not met with the AG Loretta Lynch on her private government jet days before the FBI interviewed Hillary we wouldn't be here. If Hillary wouldn't have publicly offered the AG job to Lynch in a Clinton administration we wouldn't be here. The only person Hillary can blame is Hillary. After Hillary gets sworn in as President, and this mess is still going on, start thinking about this phrase, "Constitutional Crisis". And when that time comes the only one to blame is Hillary.
20 | Cephas Chris Walker Rock | 0 | 10154746310261336_10154748708766336 | Clinton is not the best guy for America, Donald Trump is also not the best too. Democrat and Republican missed it by picking two wrong guys. As it is now let the best guy win but either of the two, Americans will surfer it. With Donald terrorism will increase and with Clinton corruption and legalized abortion will increase.
21 | Geri Cornett Ash | 0 | 10154746310261336_1243885792334750 | Everyone needs to really THINK about whom they will vote for in this election and I don't mean just for President! Consider ALL that is going on with each candidate. Hillary is under FBI investigation and this will not be over before the election; it also appears the Clinton Foundation is under FBI investigation which also will not go away; Hillary's long time assistant is in some way included in the FBI investigations which also will not be over until after the elections; all of these are intertwined with allegations of Hillary using the State Department for "pay to play" with this also not being over until after the election. So IF she is elected she will be under FBI investigation immediately ... When one considers what has been captured on tape of Hillary speaking herself with what the documents the FBI has already found and what they have already established, Hillary is guilty of various laws that are meant to apply to all Americans. IF she is then indicted, which she should be, would she remain president? If not, who would be president? If convicted then we know the VP would become president. Now what about everyone's Representatives and Senators? What if this election is a slide with the Presidency and both House and Senate going Democratic. THINK of the line of succession ... Tim Kaine (what do we really KNOW about him???); the Speaker of the House ... with dems I dare say Nancy Pelosi would vie for this position and can anyone picture HER as President???; the president pro tempore of the Senate .. wonder who that would be with Reid retiring; and finally the Secretary of State ... wonder if Hill will appoint Bill for this position after all he gets along really well with foreign figures ... just keep in mind all the money he received for his birthday! So before anyone casts their vote they should really THINK their vote through!
22 | Zondra Hall | 7 | 10154746310261336_10154748499481336 | Clinton isn't  able to put herself together without the booze, what is she planning getting everyone drunk and keeping them that way for 4 years, she a disgusting POS.
23 | Linda Johnson | 2 | 10154746310261336_10154748524461336 | vicious - deliberately cruel or violent  - look up your words - anyway what has he done that was violent??? Maybe he has not always been a moral man, but can you throw the first stone, are you?
24 | Linda Stillwell Ray | 1 | 10154746310261336_10154749345701336 | No way, she along with the Obama's,    are the ones inciting racism, bigotry & hatred by using minorities. They want to take eoples thoughts off of Hillary & what the Democrats have been doing. They have done it every campaign.
25 | Robert Fullmer | 2 | 10154746310261336_10154748781221336 | Donald Trump is the only one who can get us out of this nightmare created by Obama and Clinton! #TrumpPence2016 #Hillaryforprison

"I just think that he had new explosive information that compelled him to come forward.”

This morning on "FOX & Friends Weekend," Donald J. Trump Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway discussed FBI Director James Comey and the Hillary Clinton campaign's treatment of him.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jeff Lewis | 301 | 10154746458891336_10154748408386336 | What if, over the last 3+ years, someone on the Intelligence Committee or somebody with the Pentagon was sending Donald Trump classified emails and they were just discovered. Do you think the FBI or the Justice Dept would announce it? Or, would they wait until after the election to announce it? You bet your bottom dollar they would announce it from the rooftops!! Talk about whiners!! VOTE TRUMP!!!
2 | Mike Branch | 255 | 10154746458891336_10154748401781336 | I cannot vote for Hillary Clinton I think too much of the United States of America and the many people that gave their lives so that we could have freedom . I think too much of the unborn baby to see some of them took in the 7th 8th and 9th month of pregnancy, so no I could not vote Hillary for just those two reasons .Not to even mention the many other reasons
3 | Josh Nieten | 111 | 10154746458891336_10154748407631336 | You liberals are astounding. You CHOOSE to ignore actual confirmed and definitive examples of corruption, lies, perjury, law-breaking, very real FBI investigations, Congressional hearings and investigations, incredibly poor judgement, multiple national security breaches, very real breaches and conflicts of interest by the Obama Attorney General, and on and on... yet you CHOOSE to obsess over garbage and meaningless CIVIL suits (which anyone can file at any time) about a handful of unconfirmed allegations regarding all kinds of meaningless and unsubstantiated claims (like Trump University. Seriously?? WTF cares???) And why?? Because politics. The complete lack of intellectual honesty coming from the Left is at an astounding all time high. It's incredible to watch. You people are beyond irrational. It's absolutely insane. I'm not even a die hard fan of Trump's. Not remotely. But you people are off the charts ridiculous. Hillary makes Trump look like Mother Teresa. Hillary supporters attempting to point out Trump's faults... It's completely laughable. What a joke. You people have lost your collective minds.
4 | Zach Kerman | 76 | 10154746458891336_10154748403111336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
5 | Timothy Paul Carroll | 61 | 10154746458891336_10154748408166336 | Here's what makes the reopening of the Clinton case by the FBI so different from last time: "Weiner is cooperating with the feds." Weiner is a three-time pervert, and this time it involves an underage female. He has a very real prison sentence in his future, that is, unless he knows things and will testify under oath. His estranged wife is Hillary's career-long personal aid. He has been abandoned by the democrats, his wife and the Clinton's themselves. He has everything to lose, or gain, depending on how much he knows and how much he cooperates. In a desperate ploy Clinton is attacking Comey, demanding he reveal what all that he is looking into. I honestly have no idea what they've found this time, but pushing Comey to release it may be a very, very bad idea. Whatever they've found, Weiner better be under 24 hour surveillance to ensure he doesn't mysteriously perish. The POTUS and the US AG have already been shown (Thank you, Wikileaks) to have aided Hillary in escaping the first investigation, so Comey's unusual move to send his letter to Congress instead of the AG shows everyone that he is not going to play the same old game as last time. It also clearly says that he does not trust the administration. In all fairness, the original investigation had all the evidence needed to indict and convict many people to lengthy prison sentences, and everyone knows it. I don't know what Comey is thinking, what he has found, or what has motivated him to actually do his job this time around, but the cooperation of a highly motivated Anthony Weiner does not bode well for Clinton, Inc.
6 | Mike Ryals | 52 | 10154746458891336_10154748405221336 | They haven't seen leadership like this before, that's why they collectively try to prevent it from entering the White House. A Trump presidency ends all the corruptions, and the establishment comfy lifestyle.
7 | Jerry Gearhart | 19 | 10154746458891336_10154748432096336 | Is the country ready for another watergate? A year of turmoil after electing a president under possible FBI review? I truly don't have the desire to watch our country go through it again. If HRC truly loves this country and the facts show lying, deception and lack of judgement help the country. Stop and Step down.
8 | Patricia Alzate Arcuri | 18 | 10154746458891336_10154748494436336 | I was born in Colombia and my family came here and became legal citizens! I support Donald Trump 100%! I love America with all my heart and I'll do anything to defend it like any American Should! #latinosfortrump #Colombiansfortrump #womenfortrump #trump2016 #MAGA #ProudDeplorable!
9 | Freeman Ledford | 7 | 10154746458891336_10154748433816336 | If they find one classified email from her server then charge her with one count and investigate the others later. Give her a speedy trial though we know she will plead the fifth it's a pattern for that who group.
10 | Richard Brinker | 15 | 10154746458891336_10154748407356336 | Remember remember the 8th of November. The Red White and Blue flew and darkness surrendered.Hill and Bill fell while Americans stood and mended.The swamp was full of greed but now the corruption is ended.Breath deep and clear as our future is cemented. We the people voted and now our dreams aren't dead but pending. Instead of opening our country we will stand and defend it,For the constitutional rights our ancestors fought for and amended. The future is brighter for all races and creeds,For all those Americans out there as I live and breath. I see hope in new beginnings and strength in knowingThat trump can heal this country and get our economy growing. Our nation is safe and our votes were heardIf Hillary is elected it only proves that the corruption is beyond absurd. Trump pulls tens of thousands and she can barely pull a herd. Stand up and vote and prove that we have a voice that deserves to be heard.
11 | Steve Rauter | 7 | 10154746458891336_10154748512936336 | The Democrat leadership lacks the integrity to do the right thing and take the long walk up the driveway of one of Hillary's mansion/safe houses to give her the bad news that she is a cancer on this nation and needs to step down.
12 | Doug Joe Joey Allen | 6 | 10154746458891336_10154748512136336 | If you're an American citizen and you want to see our country sink faster than a stone, thrown into the ocean, vote for Hillary Clinton. If you want to give America a chance to rebuild and possibly, be greater than it's ever been for ALL AMERICANS, starting from our inner cities and outward, vote for Trump/Pence and pray for G-d's grace to bring us all together, to contribute to the rebuilding of our country and unity, beyond the rancor and the vitriol and the fear mongering.
13 | Garth Barker | 6 | 10154746458891336_10154748425016336 | All the talk about where the polls stand is wrong; nearly 50% of the country have given up their landlines and those who still have them are our older citizens. Most polls are taken over the landlines so how can the poles be correct? At best the margin of error would be at 25%.
14 | Anthony D Fischer | 18 | 10154746458891336_10154748409406336 | I hear that train a comin’It’s rollin’ round the bend.Gonna pick up Mrs. ClintonAnd take her to the pen.They’ll have her coronationMake her cell block queenHillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteenThey’ve got an orange pants suitHangin’ on the wallAnd a cell for Bubba WillieJust a little down the hall.We’ll put ‘em in the big houseLock them up inside.Unless a whole lot of witnessesCommit suicide.Remember James McDougalAnd 20 or 30 moreAbout to testify, they found ‘em dead upon the floor.Now they’re pilin’ up the bodiesLike they did back thenThey want back in the White HouseHere we go again.Glue the china to the tableNail the table to the floorLock up all the silver‘fore they haul it out the doorWhite trash in the White HouseBeats all I’ve ever seen.Hillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteen. #TRUMP2016 🇺🇸

16 | Jose Ivan Montoya | 5 | 10154746458891336_10154748455196336 | This is what killerys long experience in politics has come too !!! total melt down of the system FBI corrupted DOJ corrupted Media corrupted Now FBI and the DOJ against each other!!!imagine her in the White House God save America and the world
17 | Tina Janke | 4 | 10154746458891336_10154748414691336 | I heard Clintons shared in Weiner's pedifile activity, as an actual pedifile ring! Everyone knows she's bi-sexual, and there's a LOT of odd sex acts going on in DC...Hillary has her own sex scandal going on!Who knows....just rumor for now, but that's the word on the street.
18 | Vickie Trudell | 7 | 10154746458891336_10154748545341336 | Right on!  Remember, it was HilLIARy who is ultimately responsible for ALL of this!!  She knowingly used an ILLEGAL, PRIVATE e-mail SERVER in an attempt to cover up her wrongdoings with the Clinton Foundation!!!
19 | Gary Mingolelli | 2 | 10154746458891336_10154748484526336 | There is a theory that the Justice Department reneged on a deal with the FBI in the July decision by the FBI not to charge Clinton and Instead The Justice Department would dole out a minimal punishment for Clinton....And we all know Slick Willy did his thing on the tarmac with Loretta to circumvent justice as was agreed by the FBI and DOJ.....
20 | Danny Jones | 1 | 10154746458891336_10154748687116336 | Hillary didnt expect the FBI to get there hands on that computer . It has everything needed to put Hillary away . She wants to save her buns . Obama wants to further his socialist take over of our capitalist society . The DC cartel is worried sick . They dont know if they should send Hillary down the tubes . I think they told Hillary to keep on going . But behind her back they are trying to figure out what puppet will take her place .
21 | Zach Kerman | 20 | 10154746458891336_10154748402836336 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

Where are those Republicans that wanted to be president, why are they not out there looking for justice for our country. Hillary "lied and denied", she put our nation's security at risk on an unsecured server and numerous devices. Come on Republicans--stand up!!
23 | Leland Whitehouse | 3 | 10154746458891336_10154748407506336 | I pray not but there is about to be a civil war in N. Dakota.

25 | Gail Chirichella | 2 | 10154746458891336_10154748455401336 | Comey sent a letter to both parties. One has to wonder how the letter was released to the media. Someone wants to expose the Clintons.Perhaps, she should have released all the information (emails) she had at the beginning of the investigation. Hillary as no one to blame but herself. So proud of the FBI to stand up and do the right thing. The AG wanted this hushed up to cover up the Clintons again...The Clintons have been making a mockery of our justice system for some time. They used and manipulated our justice system, by showing our justice system as weak. 🤔😞 yet so many have been prosecuted and sent to jail for the same charges, while they walk on water. 😞😞

But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.I have also copied and pasted.

5 | Wayne R Johnson | 73 | 10154746687411336_10154748319016336 | Isn't it really ironic that Hillary now wants to "get all the information out"? when she has spent so much time, effort and money over the last two years hiding it, deleting it, destroying it, and lying about it?If she's innocent wrongdoing the hypocrite should pull out her backups and share All her emails with the world!!Oh, that's right she "bleach bit" it all and took a hammer to the devices.

7 | Kriss Moore | 25 | 10154746687411336_10154748382966336 | The most shocking thing I heard today came from Dem. Doug Schoen he not only a long time Democrat, but he is a long time  personal friend of Hillary. Today Doug Schoen just announced on Fox News w Harris Faulkner that "he is no longer supporting Hillary Clinton!" This is pretty big news in Dem circles but what really mattered was his reasoning. He loves his country more than Politics and he is scared of a constitutional crisis in this country if she is elected.http://www.wnd.com/2016/10/clinton-insider-abandons-hillary-on-live-tv/?cat_orig=us

This represents a double standard, with James Comey having made a point of telling the world about his new investigation into Anthony Weiner, which has no connection to Hillary Clinton whatsoever, even though he falsely tried to create that appearance when he sent his letter to Congress.

Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071. For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.

She just can’t get a break. Remember how she and her husband left the White House flat broke? I bet she thought she could keep her doctor if she liked her doctor too. Why, they’ve had to work real hard to make ends meet between giving speeches for $250,000 or more and all the charity work at the Foundation. I've heard Haiti loves the Clintons. Anyway, it’s just tough being Hillary - named after that famous mountain climber, you know. But really, folks, at this point what difference does it make? She’s admitted to not being technically gifted. She tried wiping her server with a cloth, what more can we ask of her? It’s not like anyone died under her watch, right?

17 | Jo Wallace Cummings | 1 | 10154746687411336_1448137945214936 | I just read this article on someone else's newsfeed. It's a real eye opener to say the least!Let me explain a few things to people who don't understand how this will end. People call these Muslims refugees! BS... this is an army invading our country under the assumption they are refugees. This is the only way to invade America from the inside and people say why we are strong and yes America is a super power. Killary wants to bring in 500,000 more how many are already here?. People say they are nice people I live with them and work with them, that is a red herring. Once they have enough and that will be soon if Killary is elected president. And listen to this very closely because it's no joke. Once they have the numbers here it will begin, and remember Obumer is closing Guantanamo Bay and bringing the worst of the worst Muslim leaders here to America. Why would you say does it matter well I'm going to tell you. Once the numbers are here and your "Social Security is funding all this " then they will detonate EMP bombs around America where it will do the most damage to the grid. Now some people ask what is a EMP bomb. It will destroy anything that is electrical, ie cars ,planes, generators,cell phones you get my point now. How will that be bad people ask, so I will explain . America will return to the dark ages no power to stay warm or cook no ac to stay cool no way to ship food no way to keep meat good. No place to buy food no way to call for help so people ask why would I need to call for help. Well that's when these so called refugees will turn into an Army that will start the take over of America. They will go from town to towns state to state and they will kill you cut your head's off they will rape and pillage everything and everyone they have contact with. Christians will be killed without mercy. I'll fight you say I'll call the cops or the army someone. No you won't no way to call for help phones won't work and Killary has already taken our guns so your fight won't last long. ie. Don't bring a gun to a knife fight. But don't worry Killary will set up FEMA camps for your protection she will say but many will be killed in these camps. How will you feed your family with no food no stores no walmart. So many Americans will die from starvation in the first month alone it will be sick. And then you have people in your own town that will try to take what you have to feed their's. Race groups killing and pillaging anywhere they want. America will be lost forever meanwhile all those countries that hate America will attack because we will be like sitting ducks in a pond. So prepare the best you can because this is what you are voting for if you vote this traitor as president. Some of you idiot's will laugh but I assure you when it happens it will be no laughing matter when your young girls are raped in front of you and watch as your sons and husband's heads are cut off. And no one will be able to help you you won't be able to fight because Killary took our right as American citizens all so she can fill her pockets. Obumer is Muslim plant that has brainwashed Killary into destroying the country she says she loves. Trump is our only way out of this out come so be smart people think for yourselfs and let's make America the great country it was before this traitor took control. You need to ask yourselfs why would any United States president give 400 million dollars to country like Iran that is the biggest funder of terrorist Go Trump/Pence Drain those swamps  The peaces of the puzzle are coming together to show the whole picture.  PLEASE SHARE, PLEASE
18 | Mona Soliman | 5 | 10154746687411336_10154748427216336 | I think your wrong , if she manages to get her self elected after all what she's done then she will do it again ( Obama did it) . God help this country.
19 | Warren Murray | 1 | 10154746687411336_10154748418986336 | It would seem if trump had so much foresight, he would have known some of the women he sexually assaulted would come forward eventually. He knows so much because he is involved and has even endorsed the hacking of the emails, in spite of the fact that some may contain national security information. You can't be for our government and against it too, we know where trump stands and it's not for the American way. Trump can't be trusted, neither can the gop.
20 | Angel Hernandez Sr. | 4 | 10154746687411336_10154748324361336 | You're dead wrong, Governor, who won't last are those who opposed her all these months and specially Comey, Weiner, Trump, Galifaniakis, Assange (she'll find a way with UK to pull him out of the Embassy), etc.

22 | Sarah Taylor | 1 | 10154746687411336_10154748400866336 | There is no way Hillary Clinton can win when you have huge amounts of united Americans voting for America's freedom which is for Donald Trump... bottom line and it's very obvious, they will be shoving her down the American people's throats, no different then what they did with Hussein Barack Obama!!! She has all the traits of a sociopath and people should open their eyes or at least look up the definition of the word sociopath !!!!!! She cares for no one but herself including all the ones that are at her beckon call... Go figure?
23 | Grady Stephens | 1 | 10154746687411336_10154748338211336 | That's not nice Mikey.  You ought to be praying for the poor lady, as she's in way over her head.  Trump is also out of his league.

24 | Mike Branch | 9 | 10154746687411336_10154748380056336 | I cannot vote for Hillary Clinton I think too much of the United States of America and the many people that gave their lives so that we could have freedom . I think too much of the unborn baby to see some of them took in the 7th 8th and 9th month of pregnancy, so no I could not vote Hillary for just those two reasons .Not to even mention the many other reasons
25 | Richie Brandt | 5 | 10154746687411336_10154748348911336 | so now how do all of u that support Hillary feel she's going to be investigated again for her lies and emails I hope u brainwashed people wake up because u have now been shown she is a crooked liar and should be in jail I hope she's found guilty and will not be able to buy her way out of jail .....well her buddy will try to pardon her though

"I just don't see Director Comey opening this case back up eleven days before the election unless it's quite serious."

On "Fox News Sunday," Devin Nunes discussed revelations involving the FBI sending a letter to Congress alerting them to a further cache of emails that may be pertinent to the Hillary Clinton email probe.

1 | Daniel Krautner | 614 | 10154747147646336_10154748213701336 | So the FBI releases statements about Democratic shady emails and now THE FBI'S  reputation is on the line, instead of the people the emails are about??? Uh what? Where they do that at?And Hillary and her campaign are whining about the fact that bad news is put out against them, that it's unethical, and unprecedented.. um isnt that what y'all have been doing to trump every chance they get? They weren't saying anything when they fabricated sex abuse accusations, and other dirt they throw at him.. So yall can dish it out but cant take it? Hah... cute.#trump2017 #hillaryforprison #donaldtrump #fbi #comey #riggedsystem
2 | Larry DeFilippis | 271 | 10154747147646336_10154748219671336 | Doug Schoen, a major Clinton supporter and friend, has come out on FOX News saying, because Clinton's election could lead to a constitutional crisis, he will not be voting for her. This is major news!
3 | Colleen Marie | 157 | 10154747147646336_10154748221726336 | Let’s see if I read this right:Hillary does a piss poor job as Secretary of State, people die.She has her own Server which all matters of government business as well as personal emails are run through……turned out it wasn’t secure at all. This is where this whole email scandal starts; with a choice Hillary insisted upon……. "'By using a private email system, Secretary Clinton violated the Federal Records Act and the State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual regarding records management, and worse, could have left classified and top secret documents vulnerable to cyber attack,' Cause of Action Executive Director Dan Epstein said in an email to reporters.'This is an egregious violation of the law, and if it were anyone else, they could be facing fines and criminal prosecution.'”When it looks like she’s in trouble over her personal email server 33000 emails are deleted, and government property is destroyed, bleached, cleaned, hammered……POOF….gone. When questioned under oath she lies many times over including dozens of ‘can’t recalls’ (someone with a memory problem of this size shouldn’t be president, just saying).Then; she becomes the democratic nominee for President of the United States which might make her the first woman president, and the most powerful female in the world. She already managed to receive millions of dollars in her bank accounts, so what could be left but a quest for power? I could mention TCF (the Clinton Foundation) here but why……beating a dead horse on that one and TCF is a story for some hungry reporter to look into. Throughout the presidential race Hillary is constantly sloughing-off those pesky deleted email questions whilst something called ‘WikiLeaks’ is putting out emails reported to be the very ones that were deleted. From the Russians? Maybe, or not. We have plenty of really great ‘hackers’ in our own USA and some are even employed by the United States government.The FBI director Comey, the guy who chose not to prosecute Hillary back in July 2016, then decides on October 28th to reopen the investigation after finding more emails on Anthony Weiner’s computer that both he and estranged wife used (Weiner – let’s leave him out of this story). His wife however, is Huma Abedin; Hillary’s friend, confident, and vice chairwoman of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Huma claims she has no idea how those emails ended up on estranged hubby’s computer. Shall we say ’selective amnesia’, same sad disease that Hillary seems to have.This is a soap opera that could only happen in Washington where power is everything and the democrats are scrambling to keep the white house in their pockets – the same pockets that have degraded the middle class on down and foisted non-affordable health care insurance on every American (let’s just call it another tax because those deductibles and co-pays render it only able to use for major medical issues and diseases). The insurance premiums, co-pays, and deductibles are ruining American lives.If Hillary becomes president: 4 more years minimum of ‘Obama’ everything with the added bonus of issues Hillary holds close to her vest (notice I didn’t say heart). We’ll see her ‘pals’ put into positions of power and all answering to Hillary – like a true girl posse who protect one another and nobody else. We’ll see her hubby Bill with his own little office where (YIKKES) interns will be standard issue (hope they’re all male). We’ll see tax increases for everyone but the wealthy (this includes celebrities who’ve helped Hillary become elected and of course they want to hold onto as much of their wealth as they can). We’ll see a re-fashioned Obamacare that will not only be more costly but will cover less than currently projected for 2017. Enough of this…….let’s just say we’re all going to feel this and mostly in our wallet which then trickles down to the quality of life we work hard to have. Thing is; if we don’t have some money to enjoy our lives with we start asking ourselves why we work so hard when the government takes it in taxes. If Hillary becomes president what we won’t get is a built up Military which should be of up-most importance in the dangerous world we find ourselves living in. We won’t get a break on our current overtaxed state. We won’t get a whole NEW healthcare system that WORKS for the middle class on down (the rich can afford it, regardless). We won’t get a reset on Washington politicians and that swamp will just get murkier by the day. We won’t have new ways to keep out illegal aliens and thus the status quo stays; draining available resources AND increasing the risk of terrorism crimes. This means everyone and their brothers are coming in by the droves; just like what is happening now. More and more monies will also be put into the efforts to help illegals with health care, housing, schools, etc……(this is money we could redirect to helping those who are in America legally, feeding the poor, housing the homeless, making sure kids in schools eat, taking care of our aging that need help, and first and foremost making sure our VETS are taken care of in every way needed (what our government has allowed to happen with our VETS….it is shameful…..and shame on us all that this has happened). The government also has to STOP ‘borrowing’ from our Social Security fund. This is money that belongs to the people who’ve spent decades paying into that fund and as that money dwindles in number so does the promise that it’ll be there for those starting to pay into that system now. The older Americans are already paying too much for what was supposed to be part of their earned retirement benefits. As the deficit goes up so does the government taking monies out of Social Security. This practice is unconscionable.We who want a better America via the TRUMP/PENCE ticket are denounced for our right to vote for the vehicle that will bring America back to what it should be; we are a great country that is currently broken. All we want is our country to be safer, richer, respected, and a place where anyone can legally immigrate to if they ‘qualify’. We want to love our neighbors. We want to get along with everyone, no matter the race, gender, country of origin or skin color. We want prosperity and the hope that we get through obtaining that prosperity. We need jobs that pay better and not the current lot of low paid entry level jobs where many of us are considered over-qualified, or too old to hire, in a world where so many people need to work past the age of 70. We want our descendants to know that we did our best to make our country BETTER for them and that we didn’t use it all up; thus leaving them with little to hope for in their America. We want to be united as a country, not divided. This current division we’re feeling has to go, in favor of the unification we need to work towards. We need change and not the same downhill slide we’ve had for so many years, especially since September 11, 2001.Ignore the chatter. Ignore the resistance. Ignore the nay-sayers. Sometimes, a person has to follow their ‘gut’. Mine says NO WAY to Hillary/Kaine because they don’t bring the changes we need and having several more years of the same is intolerable.We can make a difference but we must vote and the only choice we have for what we need is TRUMP/PENCE 2017. Make your vote count. May God Bless America and all of us who live here.

Funny, Hillary Clinton stonewalled for months turning over her emails, personal computer hard drive, and 13 cell phones and other devices containing emails.  She only turned over mails after destroying evidence and bleachbitting her computer.  She should be in jail period! Clinton's operatives keep saying ~ She has cooperated fully! What!????????????????

24 | Ben Petree | 8 | 10154747147646336_10154748230356336 | Jezebel & Ahab = Hillary & Bill.  King Ahab and Queen Jezebel served as leaders of the northern kingdom of Israel during a time of much evil in the land. King Ahab was a Jewish king who married a Sidonian woman named Jezebel and became involved in worshiping Baal, the god of her people. Ahab built a house to Baal in the capital city of Samaria and made an Asherah pole as a tool of pagan worship. We are told, “Ahab did more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him” (1 Kings 16:33).Jezebel was likewise known for her evil actions. She was the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians. After her marriage to Ahab, her first recorded action was cutting off the prophets of the Lord (1 Kings 18:4). Obadiah, a God-fearing officer in Ahab’s court, noted that Jezebel killed many prophets, despite Obadiah’s efforts to save them: “Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD’s prophets by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water?” (1 Kings 18:13–14).It was during the time of Ahab and Jezebel that Elijah was the prophet in Israel. Satan had his couple on the throne, but God had His man in the field, performing miracles and leading a revival against Baal-worship. The three-and-a-half-year drought that Elijah prayed for was part of God’s judgment on the wickedness of the nation and its leaders.When Elijah confronted Ahab near the end of the drought, the king said to him, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?” (1 Kings 18:17). But Ahab had it wrong. Elijah was not the one bringing trouble on the land. The prophet corrected the king: “I have not made trouble for Israel . . . but you and your father’s family have. You have abandoned the Lord’s commands and have followed the Baals” (verse 18).After Elijah defeated the prophets of Baal and had them killed at Mt. Carmel (1 Kings 18), Jezebel issued a death threat against him (1 Kings 19:2). The queen went on to plot against Naboth, the innocent owner of a vineyard that Ahab coveted. Jezebel had Naboth killed so the king could confiscate his land (1 Kings 21), and she prodded her husband into many other wicked acts besides: “There was none who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the LORD like Ahab, whom Jezebel his wife incited” (1 Kings 21:25).Ahab’s death was predicted by the prophets Elijah and Micaiah (1 Kings 21:19; 22:28). Jezebel’s gruesome death was also predicted by Elijah (1 Kings 21:23). True to the prophecy, Ahab was killed in a battle with Syria. Later, Jezebel was thrown from a tower, “and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled on her” (2 Kings 9:33). Then, “when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands” (2 Kings 9:35). Just as Elijah had said, the dogs ate Jezebel.In Revelation 2:20 Jezebel’s reputation lives on as Jesus speaks against the church at Thyatira: “But I have this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.” The woman’s name in Thyatira was probably not literally “Jezebel,” but her immorality and idolatry in preying upon God’s people was very Jezebel-like.Both Ahab and Jezebel were leaders of God’s people who forsook the Lord and served other gods. The royal couple earned a reputation for sin and violence, and they both suffered violent deaths as part of God’s judgment on their actions.
25 | Carole Wright | 1 | 10154747147646336_634025130111047 | We wouldn't even elect someone as Treasurer   Of State if they were under an FBI investigation much less POTUS. As far as I am concerned this disqualifies her and she should step away; it is just clearly too much. And if she wants to know what Comey is talking about maybe she should not have erased them - or she could always ask Huma about it. She knows good and well they cannot release the evidence at her command.

1 | Giuseppe Alexander | 484 | 10154746369701336_10154748104421336 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

4 | Zach Kerman | 76 | 10154746369701336_10154748104406336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?

Are they planning on following Our money that they sent to Qatar? Or are they trying to figure what to do to Distract from the current issues Plaguing them? Or are they sitting around figuring out who to Bribe and to beat the FBI?

8 | Mixhael L Villar | 35 | 10154746369701336_10154748111221336 | I'm certain that I will get alot of backlash and negative feedback for what I'm about to say, but it has to be said.Throughout this entire election process there has been alot of casualties cause in part by the Media and some self inflicted. One in particular is Bill Clinton, Bill Clinton prior to Hill/Billarys stubborn attempt to become the 45th PotUSA was in my opinion going to go down in history as one of the three greatest President's ever. The first being George Washington for fighting to give us this great country. The second being John F Kennedy for defending our great nation without even having to fire a shot by staring down the Russian's as they were moving into Cuba. The third being Bill Clinton for  giving us economic growth after being seated with a declining economic which projected us into a semi recession caused by George W Bush Sr. I am fully aware of Bill's infidelities while in office, but at the time of what was going on with the economy and the lack of jobs when he stepped into the White House and the way he grab the bull by the horns and detoured our economy from going into a full fledged recession was greatly shadowed by his later indiscretion. Since Hill/Billary made the decision to run for office, she had to know what this was going to do to Bill's dignity(or what he had left) and how it was going to smash and dedicate all over her own husbands legacy without any regard to what or how it was going to affect him. Here lately everytime I see him on TV, he comes off a being an abused dog with his tale between his leg's suffering from dementia. Sad that she would even sacrifice her own family member (husband) to feed her sick delusion of becoming the next PotUSA.

The stakes are huge. If she wins she squashes the whole thing like a bug. If she loses, she likely goes to jail. She is going to pull out all of the stops between now and Election Day. All money and effort gets applied. Knowing her someone actually might "accidentally" die along the way, if I'm Huma and/or Weiner, I'm not sleeping very soundly

15 | Keith Mallon | 3 | 10154746369701336_10154748294991336 | I'd like to remind Hillary about her comment on playing cards as she refers to "Deal Me In". Rule number 1. When the game starts and you have been dealt your hand, it is impolite to ask your opponent to show their cards. In other words, don't ask Comey to show his cards while the game is being played, you will see his cards soon enough...In this case the river may be up the river for you.

Walsh and democrat hacks always bragged about how he made the difference when it came to electing Clinton for his first term.

With that you know they are stalling for time that means the FBI, CIA, Justice Department and State Department are all in her pocket. For if she goes to trial all involved will go to jail that even includes the White House. Our Government is for We The People that is the document they are all to protect from anyone even the president.
22 | Cheryl Melnyk | 6 | 10154746369701336_10154748113661336 | Hillary Clinton has no one to blame but herself for all her email problems. While Hillary was admonishing her subordinates at the State Dept NEVER to use private email for government business, she was doing exactly that with her government correspondence. Although Hillary was briefed about the proper handling of government documents (including classifed and top secret documents) when she first became Secretary of State in 2009, and signed a document under oath that she would follow the rules and regulations, she ignored them. Now, as a result of an unrelated investigation of pervert Anthony Weiner and his alleged "involvement" with underage girls, the FBI seized the laptop he shared with his wife Huma Abedin, and they found that there are e-mails on it related to Hillary Clinton's work at the State Dept. This would never have happened if Hillary and Huma had handled their government documents according to the rules and regulations that they agreed to abide by. But Hillary believes the rules and the laws are made for other people and she can do whatever she wants. Therein lies the problem.Hillary may still be elected, but this is not going away.

3 | Phillip C Parrish | 245 | 10154746281476336_10154747961576336 | American Citizens must indict, prosecute, and convict Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election. Hillary Clinton's conduct and policies lead to the deaths of countless American citizens and the destabilization of North Africa, Europe, and Syria. Hundreds of thousands of women and children are suffering every day and will suffer for the rest of their lives because of her choices. Her corrupt and subversive behaviors caused extremely grave damage to every American State and our national security. Hillary Clinton's direct connection to sharia compliant Islamic salafist jihadists has been repeatedly evidenced through public reporting. "What kind of example do we want for our daughters," Clinton asks. Not you Hillary. She personifies everything we don't want our children to be. The only thing sicker than violent, abusive, and dishonest people are those like Hillary who enable and make excuses for them. These statements expose those who have conspired to cause America harm; it is not a conspiracy theory. Hillary Clinton and the salafist-owned militant mainstream media conspire to advance a one world order Islamic salafist jihadi agenda that is the antithesis of the American Constitution, freedom, justice, and democracy.If you, the America citizen, vote for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, you will be spitting in the face of your children and grandchildren. You will be treading disrespectfully on the graves of your loved ones. We must send a direct message to Washington, D.C. that we will not tolerate a two-track justice system. We will no longer tolerate a system where the wealthy and political elite are above the law while the general public is prosecuted and persecuted for frivolous infractions, impacting the rest of their lives.Americans rise up, vote, and drag your friends and family to the voting booth. Don't sit this one out. Rise above being cynical and vote. You, your children's, and your grandchildren's lives are at stake. It really is that desperate.

He got enough people to attend his Rallies? Where's Bill? He's the only one on the Campaign Trail! Has Hillary and the Obama's trying to figure out who to commit Suicide? Are they planning on following Our money that they sent to Qatar? Or are they trying to figure what to do to Distract from the current issues Plaguing them? Or are they sitting around figuring out who to Bribe and to beat the FBI?
7 | Larry DeFilippis | 143 | 10154746281476336_10154747962916336 | Doug Schoen, a major Clinton supporter and friend, has come out on FOX News saying, because Clinton's election could lead to a constitutional crisis, he will not be voting for her. This is major news!
8 | Jarrod Hamlin | 123 | 10154746281476336_10154747959656336 | The most corrupt woman in the world, is running for president. Wow. Tick tock Killary. The reaper is coming. You're going to prison. Where you should have been a long time ago.  : ) You have the blood of soldiers and millions of babies on your hands. You're done. #Trump2016

10 | Keith Mochida | 65 | 10154746281476336_10154747963676336 | Dear Hillary,Please, just drop out of the American presidential race. Not only are you embarrassing the American People but you are making a complete fool of yourself. You're done, we know what you have been up to. We know justice will be done. You and your fellow cronies will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, oh and no, Odumber will not be able to help you. Bye bye now.
11 | Diane Gorman Lytwyn | 30 | 10154746281476336_10154748080436336 | Not only did Obama know all about it, but he lied, and THAT is the reason Jim Comey didn't go full tilt boogie and prosecute Clinton! Obama should be impeached, Clinton needs to withdraw from the race!
12 | Maggie Gitta Tiefenthal | 43 | 10154746281476336_1802580820014922 | I'm from Germany. Just look at my once beautiful country. We had a woman open the borders and it has created chaos and danger. Tonight in Germany innocent people were stabbed at the Train Station in Frankfurt ISIS related.As a woman I was never afraid to walk in Germany at night,because it was so safe. Now even scared to walk in the day time. If Hillary Clinton win,the USA will fall to the enemy this will be the end of the USA. Yes Trump is somewhat crazy,but he cares for the USA. And he will be a great President and you know why. He dosen't like to lose or talked bad about. He will protect the USA. I hope that next week American People will be smart and do what needs to be done. For Germany and Europe is to late.This woman should never be in the race,any other person would be in Jail. This Whitehouse is horrible and your administration so horrible.
13 | KimSears DennisSlater | 46 | 10154746281476336_10154747977566336 | The Benghazi deaths should have kept her from running in the first place, but no. Then she was under investigation for e mail, and still in the race. Then she cheated in the primary and still not disqualified. Now shes under investigation again. And she was calling for Trump to bow out over the audio that had nothing to do with America or harmed America whatsoever. She needs to be disqualified, her actions have harmed America for years, and we cant afford more years of her.
14 | Barry Bingaman | 36 | 10154746281476336_10154747967666336 | Barrack Obama knew everything. He is just another lying Left Wing Liberal Democrat that doesn't put the American people first.
15 | Greg Watson | 42 | 10154746281476336_10154747959201336 | Of course OBAMA lied!! No big deal....no matter what they find in the emails, you can lay out all of the corruption there is, and it will NEVER matter...the Clintons own the FBI and the Department of Justice...both are subdivisions of the Clinton Foundation....their Teflon suits roll the charges right off....nothing will ever stick. Remember Loretta Lynch recently pled the 5th during questioning-the highest legal position in the country pleads the 5th! Simply amazing!
16 | Janice Mottes Mascia | 24 | 10154746281476336_10154748016041336 | I don't want her to drop out of the race.  i WANT HER TO LOOSE BIG TIME.  I don't want obama to have any reason to halt the election, to call a do over, to put in Kaine or Biden at the last minute.  I do not want him to say he will reamain as president since it is so close to election day when she dropped out.
17 | Andi Larson | 30 | 10154746281476336_10154747980116336 | Hillary plays the victim/dumb card and then says she is smart enough to be president. You can't have it both ways, you're either too ignorant and can't remember, or the smartest person in the nation.
18 | Sherri Wagner | 21 | 10154746281476336_10154747976836336 | They should have enough evidence now that she should not be allowed to run for president and she should be indicted. She has cost millions of dollars investigating her. Both Clintons should go to jail, two for the price of one! Obama can go along with them.😂
19 | Marsha Strawder | 19 | 10154746281476336_10154748009741336 | No one could make this stuff up ... it just keeps getting worse everyday. I can only imagine how we look to the rest of the world ...one BIG, CORRUPT clown show. There's no telling what else is going on since we as a nation all to often have to rely on outside resources to tell us. Please just lock the entire administration up and get it over with already.
20 | Thomas Bloodgood | 19 | 10154746281476336_10154748015376336 | if she never  set it up in the first place none of this would be out there ,now she is at a bar getting drunk and the dems . want to know what the hell is going on. she made millions while being sec of state and filled her pockets with countries that are against us. she is so corrupt she should have never been able to run for anything but jail boss. VOTE TRUMP GO TRUMP
21 | Sherry Slowikowski | 17 | 10154746281476336_10154748040396336 | When Pres Obama lied to the American people about when he found out about her server on national TV, that's proof hes covering up his part in all this corruption.
22 | Eileen Jones | 17 | 10154746281476336_10154748014191336 | it just amazes me that the dems can say anything about Trump but when it comes home to them, Oh my, they want aswers now, how dare they investigate the liar, the thousands of emails, the money,.the 4 dead men...wow, interesting when the tables are turned.
23 | Lorraine Modzelewski | 17 | 10154746281476336_10154748060401336 | Obama has been bullshitting the American people since he was a junior senator right through his presidency. Of course he knew about the private server. Corruption? Obama and his administration are the most corrupt our nation has ever seen. The only people who don't know what's going on in our government are our lesser educated citizens. Will Comey do what's right this time? Only if he defies Obama and Lynch. Hillary needs to be convicted just as anyone else who had done what she did would be.
24 | Dee Jacobs | 5 | 10154746281476336_10154747981946336 | The past 2 elections were about Obama birth certificate and even though he produced one..it was discounted by this deplorable racist....now it is emails and even though FBI has cleared Clinton the same racist misogynists continue to make noise....Clinton will win by a landslide just like Obama did watch this space!!!!!!
25 | Russ Grove | 10 | 10154746281476336_10154748015526336 | Of course nobama knew....he knows everything his crew does....he is the master orchestrator of his corrupt administration....he is no dummy...he has a diabolical plan to bring the country to its knees....and will do anything to see it through

2 | Melchizedek Hughes | 498 | 10154746266471336_10154747864866336 | The fact this wasn't re-opened kinda makes this situation even worse for Hillary. This corrupt idiot shouldn't be anywhere near the white house.
3 | Rockwell Torrey | 377 | 10154746266471336_10154747863636336 | This is your moment. This is your time to take a stand. When your grandchildren speak of you they will recount that you stood for America. You did not surrender. You did not run away. You held strong for freedom and the Constitution. You defeated Hillary Clinton. You voted Trump. You ensured that America survived.
4 | Fred Buterbaugh | 200 | 10154746266471336_10154747863701336 | Since Killary has already admitted she made a "mistake" with her emails (33,000 times),  and deleted them (many of them confidential) she is INELIGIBLE to even hold public office. For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here’s what it says: "(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”

7 | John Henry | 76 | 10154746266471336_10154747886081336 | The FBI should do as Hillary says... release the info that they have which prompted them to reopen the investigation. Yes, all 650,000 emails haha. She doesn't realize what she's asking for. And this time, she can't blame the Russians! LMAO !!!
8 | John Shuba | 56 | 10154746266471336_10154747880191336 | Damage control is taking place furiously in both the Clinton and Obama camps. Media heavyweights across the country are being called in and given their marching orders in no uncertain terms. Will there be a joint strategy or will each side fend for themselves? Nobody is getting much sleep tonight either at the White House or Clinton HQ.

12 | Gerald Browning | 39 | 10154746266471336_10154747929716336 | If Hillary Clinton is elected she will be "a sitting US President under an active FBI investigation". Our country will be in a constitutional-political-domestic and international-financial and MORAL CRISIS. Please don't allow this to happen.
13 | Kelly Kapoor | 32 | 10154746266471336_10154747902481336 | God is helping Mr. Trump. When he has less money, no endorsement from major newspapers or famous republicans Bush or Romney , he got FBI 's move at right time. James Comey's conscience got a big shake from Almighty. James Comey needs to be applauded for his guts to reopen HRC's case. He is not supporting republican candidate or any party candidate, he owes this to his motherland- United States of America !!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
14 | James White | 37 | 10154746266471336_10154747946236336 | Why is it the news media has overlooked HUMA ABEDIN'S connections with the Muslim brotherhood and top-secret information that could've been passed on to an enemy within.
15 | John Southworth | 18 | 10154746266471336_10154747896771336 | Robby Mook is just as corrupt as Hillary Clinton. You can just see the lies oozing from his every pore when he speaks. And since the entire Hillary Corruption Gang is feigning stupidity, let me clear some things up for you: FBI Director James Comey has not seen a single email that was referred to in his letter to Congress---yet. Why? Because the computer containing the emails in question belonged to Anthony Wiener, and the FBI has never had that particular computer in their possession. New York U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara is in charge of the pedophile case involving Anthony Wiener. And apparently it was his staff that uncovered this treasure trove of new information. And, it is highly possible that the 33,000 emails that Hillary's minions spent 3-months 'bleach-bitting' are readily accessible on this particular computer. So, it was Preet Bharara that contacted Comey, and must have told him what he found---hence the letter. I am sure we will find out more in the coming days.............But, if the 33,000 emails are THERE, then you know Hillary's goose is more than likely cooked!
16 | Tim Warp | 13 | 10154746266471336_10154747917086336 | Do you realize that Hillary doesn't care about America one bit. It's all about her selfish goal to be President. If she were to be elected, herself, Huma, Lynch, and the whole bunch of them will be under investigation and or indictment. There is so much corruption going on it couldn't be resolved in less than a year or more. Not to mention the Clinton foundation revelations. How is she going to run this country and be in hearings all the time? She already admitted wrong with the private server and LIED to the FBI on several interviews. If (and when) they find emails on Weiner's and Huma's laptop it will turn this nation upside down. Hillary knows what's on that computer and is trying to lay another smoke screen till election day. Fortunately the American people are seeing BIG time what is going on. I don't believe for 1 second Comey revisits this for his own good. Huma lied when she said there were no more computers or emails and so did Hillary. good luck being know as the greatest nation on the globe.
17 | Daniel Frusco | 12 | 10154746266471336_10154747878381336 | The FBI can make a turn around on the last attacks in this country in most cases 24 hrs yet they cannot with all the evidence they now been give and yet cannot give a answer or arrest her and the staff. With that you know they are stalling for time that means the FBI, CIA, Justice Department and State Department are all in her pocket. For if she goes to trial all involved will go to jail that even includes the White House. Our Government is for We The People that is the document they are all to protect from anyone even the president.
18 | Pat VanBuren | 21 | 10154746266471336_10154747881946336 | Hillary MUST step down!! Hillary has caused her own problems bc she admits she doesn't understand how Classified information needs to be handled.
19 | Matt Duran | 15 | 10154746266471336_10154747865796336 | I would still rather trust a duly chastised Hillary with critical top secret information than the impulsive, loud-mouthed thin-skinned Donald Trump.
20 | Mary Ann Malacek | 17 | 10154746266471336_10154747968156336 | What I know. Trump's rally in CO brought tears to my eyes today. He was passionate about his love for this country. He said he didn't need to do this. He could be home laid back watching the football game. That is true. He is out there fighting hard against corruption. If you vote and hillary wins, we are facing up to two years of investigation and if convicted than impeached we are stuck with Kaine for another two years.
21 | John Allen | 4 | 10154746266471336_10154747898706336 | Huma Abedin is or was Hillary Clinton's top aid and her Deputy Chief of Staff for the former Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. What percentage of emails do you suppose were sent to Hillary Clinton in which Huma was copied  (cc) and/or exchanged between the aforementioned? I venture to say that the percentage would be substantial.Those correspondences, regardless of their nature, are now rumored to have been found on numerous electronic devices by the New York Office of the FBI during the Anthony Weiner investigation.
22 | Matthew P. Wyatt | 4 | 10154746266471336_10154747996211336 | Did I just hear this clown say at the very end " we know Donald Trump can't bring this nation together"? Really, that's his best defense and offense?? Sheep!!
23 | Donna Baskin | 3 | 10154746266471336_1088769021239837 | Trump has an open Child Rape case going into Court on 12/16/16. This entire 2016 Election process is a mess. Need to let Dems and Rep put new names in a hat and pull for 2 new candidates. Can't trust either.
24 | Bobbi Marker | 6 | 10154746266471336_10154747905221336 | ENFORCE AMERICAS LAWS!!!🇺🇸TRUMP/PENCE ALL THE WAY!!!🇺🇸NEVER A Lie Named Hillary ... I don’t detest Hillary Clinton because she is a woman. I oppose her because she cannot tell the truth to save her life. Any public servant who has the gall to issue a list of terms the press cannot utter, as if disposing the corpse of free will, is helplessly deluded and a petulant child. Sorry, Hillary, but no one owes you anything; especially the nation you proclaim to serve with nothing but the benevolence of blind ambition. If your candidacy cannot survive without the aid of deception, division, and the fabricated catcalls of “sexism” to demonize your critics, then please tell us why America needs you? Better yet, please explain how you’re even worthy of a job? A leader doesn’t need pollsters, a panel of advisers, two news conferences and a room full of media drones just to announce whether or not she used an unauthorized server to conduct official government business and therefore deleted emails in an attempt to avoid prosecution. A leader would never break the law in the first place. And a leader doesn't shout “what does it matter” when four lives are lost in the wake of her unmitigated failure. Any self-respecting adult with an ounce of integrity would simply admit the truth. Excuse me, any self-aware child who knows the difference between right and wrong, life and death. She was thrown off off the Congressional Watergate panel for lying and she hasn't stopped lying since!!! And some people want her as our President - she can't won't even tell the Truth as Secretary of State - and remember all she has done there to pad her financial pockets and political career - That should be over.If I’m hiring someone to run my business, placing my future in foreign hands, I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican, a man or woman, white or black. I want the most qualified candidate whose character speaks for itself and whose ideals can stand on the merits of their own wisdom. That’s common sense. Are you going to have the audacity to tell me what I can and can’t ask; what verbiage is acceptable? If your resume and vision are truly best for the entire nation, not just one party, gender or race, either should be able to withstand the most blistering questions and exhaustive scrutiny. In fact, you should welcome any and all discourse to discredit your detractors and display your competence. A leader unites, empowers and inspires by example, not by excuses or endless blame. Tell me the national debt is a record 18 trillion and that Barack Obama has raised it more than the first 42 presidents combined. Admit that 93 million Americans are out of the workforce, nearly 50 million are on public assistance, and that the economic recovery is a sham. Admonish Iran as a destabilizing force of Islamic radicalism that must never be mentioned in the same sentence as “nuclear power". Recognize the reality every civilized nation has immigration laws and that American sovereignty, the safety and security of her people, supersedes any political ploy to stuff the ballot box beneath the hollow cries of racism.Yes, just like generations of legal immigrants before your candidacy, respect is given when trust is earned. If you are incapable of acknowledging simple, documented facts - solely because it’s easier to hide behind a propaganda platform that cajoles and incites an expendable public - you're not interested in solving anything, let alone serving the American people or any notion of truth. You’re the cancer killing the country I love. You’re the lie my forefathers never told... Hillary Clinton has a long and inglorious history of alleged document tampering and questionable legal maneuverings... AMERICAN VOTERS WE NEED TO KEEP HER OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.. SHE BELONGS IN JAIL - PLEASE - PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE!

10 | Patricia Pavelich Shirk | 250 | 10154747207151336_1488999877782509 | This was a Hate Crime and should be charged accordingly. Destroying property especially in the name of a Politician during Presidential race is also Political Crime. He should be put away for awhile. People need to realize that you cannot act in violence. Whats next personal attacks on Mr. Trump? Stop the Violence! Lock him up!
11 | Laura Snyder | 143 | 10154747207151336_934298563381257 | 52 years old and you still haven't figured out how to behave like an adult!! Wow. Bet you have kids too. Fabulous role model and a PRIME example of a rude,self entitled liberal.
12 | Melissa Miller Pierce | 91 | 10154747207151336_1489026047779892 | I certainly do not condone vandalism but 3 years...WOW, maybe he should have just mishandled classified information, threatened national security, and committed treason. Then he could have ran for president!
13 | Andjelka Mihelcic | 76 | 10154747207151336_1489002747782222 | It's so sad how mean and rude are supporters of dishonest Hillary. They acting like her to attacking everybody who support Mr. Trump and Mr Pence. God help us if she she's win.
14 | Christina Nilsen | 98 | 10154747207151336_1488998127782684 | Our society is out of control due the chaos created by this lawless liberal administration.  Everyone thinks they can break the law.  Did you know that "community organizers" (Obama) go in, stir the pot and then leave, and fix nothing!!!!!
15 | Peg Henry | 88 | 10154747207151336_10154747792591336 | Sounds like a spoiled brat that doesn't have anything better to do. In the video (while destroying the star),  he said he has four or five women in his life that have been abused by men… I wonder if he's figured out if it's four or five yet?
16 | Timothy E. Gorrie | 123 | 10154747207151336_1761709427425308 | Ten reasons to vote Democrat #10. I vote Democrat because I love the fact that I can now marry whatever I want. I've decided to marry my German Shepherd. #9. I vote Democrat because I believe oil companies' profits of 4% on a gallon of gas are obscene, but the government taxing the same gallon at 15% isn't. #8. I vote Democrat because I believe the government will do a better job of spending the money I earn than I would. #7. I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is fine as long as nobody is offended by it. #6. I vote Democrat because I'm way too irresponsible to own a gun, and I know that my local police are all I need to protect me from murderers and thieves. I am also thankful that we have a 911 service that gets police to your home in order to identify your body after a home invasion. #5. I vote Democrat because I'm not concerned about millions of babies being aborted so long as we keep all death row inmates alive and comfy. #4. I vote Democrat because I think illegal aliens have a right to free health care, education, and Social Security benefits, and we should take away Social Security from those who paid into it. #3. I vote Democrat because I believe that businesses should not be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to break even and give the rest away to the government for redistribution as the Democrat Party sees fit. #2. I vote Democrat because I believe liberal judges need to rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit fringe kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters. And, the #1 reason I vote Democrat is because I think it's better to pay $billions$ for oil to people who hate us, but not drill our own because it might upset some endangered beetle, gopher, or fish here in America. We don't care about the beetles, gophers, or fish in those other countries. "The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits". Albert Einstein I know you all will appreciate this definition. The best description of Obamacare so far:  Remember when Nancy Pelosi said: "We have to pass it, to find out what's in it." A physician called into a radio show and said: "That's the definition of a stool sample."
17 | Denise Drago Boal | 60 | 10154747207151336_1489000587782438 | Another new great American value, destroy private property because you disagree. Ranks right up there with, killing babies, lying, disrespecting the American flag, entitlements, disregarding authority and dismissing half the population as deplorable. This guy is a criminal.
18 | Susan Amendola Gross | 59 | 10154747207151336_1631770673787822 | Actually, I don't think he should go to jail I think he should pay a massive fine something in the neighborhood of $50-$100,000 and have to do three years of community service! Cleaning up the streets, helping out at Hollywood homeless shelters and picking up trash on the 405 in an orange vest every day for three years. Taxpayers should not have to put him up for three years. His 15 minutes of fame and pretend civic awareness should not cost Los Angeles a dime. Oh, and by the way I would feel the same if he were pro trump vandalizing something!

20 | Caroline Ruppert- Hill | 38 | 10154747207151336_1488999027782594 | It's not about politics it's destruction of property.. you can't allow this to slide, then I guess any one who's political views we disagree with Star is up for grabs, what about John Wayne's star, he respected the flag agreed with the second amendment too, you gonna let him crush that STAR?????
21 | Rose Mary Hemmingsen-Clemons | 39 | 10154747207151336_1489001377782359 | Dressed like a "Los Angeles Department of Transportation worker?"  Why disguise yourself?  AND he got caught ANYWAY, in spite of the attempt at cowardly disguising himself.  JUST LIKE HILLARY.  She's desperately trying to disguise herself as the honorable, respectable, honest, Democratic candidate for POTUS.  He's an activist, AND an heir to the Otis Elevator Company?  Well, that's "one elevator that doesn't go all the way to the top!"

This morning on "FOX & Friends Weekend," Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said Donald J. Trump is leading in Texas early voting, and warned against a Hillary Clinton presidency.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Corky Johnson | 924 | 10154746207166336_10154747678151336 | Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump go into a bakery.As soon as they enter the bakery, Hillary steals three pastries and puts them in her pocket.She says to Donald, "See how clever I am?The owner didn't see anything and I don't even need to lie." I will definitely win the election.The Donald says to Hillary, "That's thetypical dishonesty you have displayedthroughout your entire life, trickery anddeceit. I am going to show you an honest way to get the same result."Donald goes to the owner of the bakeryand says, "Give me a pastry and I willshow you a magic trick." Intrigued, theowner accepts and gives him a pastry.Trump swallows it and asks for anotherone. The owner gives him another one.Then Donald asks for a third pastry andeats that, too.The owner is starting to wonder where the magic trick is and asks, "What did you do with the pastries?" Trump replies, "Look in Hillary's pocket".
2 | Katie Pulley Weeks | 490 | 10154746207166336_10154747685026336 | That is an understatement. It's surreal that we even have such a corrupt candidate for President, who is completely and factually exposed, and people are still okay with that. A very disturbing sign of the times.
3 | Cook Ana | 126 | 10154746207166336_10154747703026336 | I voted for Trump and Pence....hope all of you will at least try.  Even if election is rigged, we will know we did our best on behalf of the young millinneals that are too green to get the importance of this election.  I want a strong GOOD Country for my children, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren.  I am relieved I voted for Trump!
4 | Mark Simmons | 56 | 10154746207166336_10154747711346336 | HILLARY SAID: If your under investigation by the FBI, you shouldn't be able to BUY A GUN. I say If your under investigation by the FBI, you shouldn't be able to RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
5 | Sue Fox | 31 | 10154746207166336_10154747753266336 | Anybody in their right mind would not want this woman in the White house. My mom always told me if there is smoke their is fire. There is alot of fire being covered up here. It spreads from the Clintons to The White House to the Democratic Party to the Western Hemisphere Union to the New World Order. If she gets elected we don't stand a chance. They will all treat us like the her ignorant friends have.
6 | Pete Shaw | 40 | 10154746207166336_10154747685951336 | You know, everyone complains about our Government, term Limits, Corruption, poor service, constant battles of this that and the other thing. Here is our chance for term limits, the Clinton's have been part of the Elite Political Class for years, many Congress and Senators have been there for years and years now. 2014 started the purge of some of these Elites and there is more to do. If the American People pass up this chance to do something about it then all will be lost for many many years. Trump is not a Political Elite, Trump has taken it upon himself to spend an ungodly amount of his own money just to do this. Give the man some credit. If America doesn't stand up to continued corruption that the Clinton's and other's offer, we have totally lost. The fact that the Liberal Medias and many Political Elites are attacking Trump seems to say to me any way is that they are totally scared of losing their piece of the pie. Stand up. Trump says he will turn Washington D.C. on it's head. Is that the message we need to send, I think so.
7 | Ernest Jenkins | 33 | 10154746207166336_10154747691486336 | The stench of corruption in Washington is so bad that we will not survive as a country if we elect Obama's choice to continue his legacy! Without equal justice for all, our laws and Constitution are worthless and we will end up with an elite ruling class that will continue destroying everything we hold true and righteous! A nation divided cannot stand! Obama with his unmitigated arrogance spent countless hours chasing a little white ball over the grassy fairways while millions of poor Black, Hispanic, and Latinos suffered in the crime and drug infested inner cities of Baltimore, Detroit and Chicago! Does anyone recall him leaving his play fields to go and visit with the citizens, ministers and leaders of these communities to find solutions to their plight? Instead he supports the false hopes of Black Lives Matter while he plays and the inner cities crumble from a lack of law and order and hopelessness! And the people are asked to support his "Legacy" and continue the festering corruption by choosing a woman who laughs about the killing of world leaders while lining her pockets with corrupt "play for pay" government access! Has she visited the inner cities, offered solutions for creating jobs and promised better education opportunities like school choice as her opponent has? And yet you want to give her and her party continued support for their failed policies?? It is time to break the chains of bondage and corruption or we will all be destroyed as a country that promised equal opportunity for all!
8 | Mixhael L Villar | 9 | 10154746207166336_10154747708321336 | WoW Food for Thought,With the rehashing of all of Bill Clintons non sexual affairs with all of his accuser's one thing I couldn't wrap my head around is why would Hill/Billary stand by his side even after being evicted from the White House for those same activities? The only explaination I could come up with to explain her devotion to him would be that maybe, just maybe, she was a victim herself way back when they first met. That being the case if in fact it was the case explains alot as to her personal preference. After being assaulted by Bill in their college days might have help her to forget the conflict she had going on inside herself as to her sexual preference which was her desire for women (remember back then homosexuality was not as acceptable as it is in todays time.) After Bills infidelities while being in the White House only reiterate that she was more in line with being gay than she was being a heterosexual and Bill activity only instilled that in her (hence her staying with him for public purposes) Although she still has not come out of the closet, she still possess those traits. That would also explain her closest to Huma Abedin knowing her dysfunctional marriage with Weiner. WoW, I see a sexual scandal coming out very soon involving Hill/Billary and Huma, maybe it won't be anything more than Huma helping Hill/Billary change her depends or maybe ALL the skeleton will actually come out of Hill/Billary's closet. Things that make you go hmmmmm
9 | Vickie Trudell | 10 | 10154746207166336_10154747780271336 | Ain't that the truth!  HilLIARy is the most corrupt person to ever seek the Presidency of the United States!!  Regardless of what the FBI does, on election day, the American people WILL indict her, as we OVERWHELMINGLY elect Donald J. Trump as our next President!!!
10 | Rose Gold | 15 | 10154746207166336_10154747710531336 | Vote Blue all the way!! Hillary never hid anything. She admitted of the emails but Trump lies every second he opens his mouth!

12 | Andi Larson | 6 | 10154746207166336_753826828098918 | The way the Democrats try to dispirit everybody and impugn people is basically insult their intelligence.

14 | Songcha Meyer | 1 | 10154746207166336_862059510597803 | someone on the Fox said that Mr. Trump should buy 30 min and speak what he's going to do, i,e,working with democrats, etc. While doing so, please, please assure American people that Mr. Trump will never bring shame to the oval office by misconduct or corruption. Please do it right and win!!!!

They are known for a life of continuous deception, extraordinary egocentricity, are callous, manipulative, deceptive, impulsive, secretive, grandiose and lacking in emotional depth. Norms to them are nothing more than rules that apply to other people, and they generally feel that nothing is wrong with them.Having said all of that, does this remind you of any high profile person whose indiscretions are now being covered on all of the major news networks?
21 | Karen Stipp | 2 | 10154746207166336_10154747801701336 | This election is going to come down to this. Do you want to keep more of what you earn or do you want to give it ti the government? Do you think the government spends money wisely or will you do a better job.  If you think the government can handle your money, think of Social Security, The VA, Obamacare, the IRS they are all screwed up. Now think of how well the private sector does. Amazon, FedEx, Costco, Facebook, Ebay, UPS, the list goes on and on all successes. Do you know best on how to run your life or does the government. Do you want to take care of the unlimited flow of the worlds immigrants or do you want to take care of Americans? Do you want an America governed by Americans or be governed by some world order. I want to hear the Star-Spangled Banner to say the Pledge of Allegiance and living in America for all Americans of any race. Vote  for Donald J Trump.

Uh what? Where they do that at?And Hillary and her campaign are whining about the fact that bad news is put out against them, that it's unethical, and unprecedented.. um isnt that what y'all have been doing to trump every chance they get? They weren't saying anything when they fabricated sex abuse accusations, and other dirt they throw at him.. So yall can dish it out but cant take it? Hah... cute.#trump2017 #hillaryforprison #donaldtrump #fbi #comey #riggedsystem
2 | GB Esh | 184 | 10154746354161336_10154747575866336 | Because if the country was united then the two of them and the rest of the crooked and corrupt politicians would never get away with everything they already get away with. And to even think there are people that are ok with politicians being corrupt is mind blowing.
3 | Jennifer Massullo | 60 | 10154746354161336_10154747595386336 | Can you just imagine if Trump was involved in anything even close to this? It would be all over the news, all over social media, and Barack and Michelle would be having endless press conferences, along with all the super intelligent "famous actors" who are so far removed from ordinary life. This is just amazing. No wonder why the Clintons have been able to get away with so much for so many years.

A bit much in my opinion ..After her testy exchange with Newt Gingrich a few days ago I knew something was going on … Her heated exchange with Gingrich was an audition for other more Liberal venues and I’m sure it will be on her Demo disc … Megyn is full of herself , and when this happens just let’em go … To many others can do her job for far less money … Bring back Andrea Tantaros , Kimberly Guilfoyle or bring in Tomi Lahren .. Any of these girls’ are great …. I would like to see Andrea come back though ….
10 | Ashley Monique Webster | 8 | 10154746354161336_10154747602006336 | She is completely brain dead. Really don't care if Hilary was emailing the devil. Trump cannot become president. He is worse. Better luck in 2020 finding a decent candidate that us independents can support.
11 | Dylan Schmiel | 7 | 10154746354161336_10154747689911336 | Where is the coverage of Standing Rock? Where is President Obama? Stand up with Standing Rock and protect our clean water. Our children don't want to drink Flint Michigan water. We don't need and cant afford another Exxon Valdez or BP Gulf Horizon. We don't need or want more pipelines, we need less. We need less gas and oil consumption. Without clean water we die.
12 | Alicia Delacruz | 11 | 10154746354161336_10154747595461336 | There is a clear path of the Democratic Party to take the presidency, the house and the senate... This is the core issue why the FBI director was pressured to make the announcement... #Ihaveherback 💕 Grab them by the polls vote blue 💙🇺🇸💙
13 | Victor Rubio | 7 | 10154746354161336_10154747605271336 | I can imagine the meeting at Fox. "Let's put all the crap we've been peddling for the last eight years, especially the blame playbook for Obama, and now blame Clinton."
14 | William Page | 4 | 10154746354161336_1600005313634936 | The only ones who have divided this country are the same ones who were against Obama even before he became the democratic nominee.Like Fox news and their followers.An a sexual harasser,an dictator admirer named trump.
15 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 11 | 10154746354161336_10154747580831336 | Brief overview of why HRC's email activities are problematic, a bit of an understatement ------- When Clinton would draft an email based on classified information, she was drafting that email on an assumed authorized Blackberry, iPad or computer. But when she hit “send,” that email was knowingly routed to her unsecured server — an unauthorized location — for both storage and transfer.Next we have the lack of proper authority to move or hold classified information somewhere, i.e., the “unauthorized location.” - More 5th amendment Privilege declarations.er private lawyers in 2014, the classified materials were in each instance again removed to another unsecured location. Platte River officials have since pleaded their 5th Amendment privilege.Next we have the lack of proper authority to move or hold classified information somewhere, i.e., the “unauthorized location.” - More 5th amendment Privlege declarations.While it’s possible for a private residence to be an “authorized” location, and it’s also possible for non-government servers and networks to be “authorized” to house and transfer classified materials, there are specific and stringent requirements to achieve such status. Simply being secretary of state didn’t allow Clinton to authorize herself to deviate from the requirements of retaining and transmitting classified documents, materials and information.
16 | Gerald Barnhill | 27 | 10154746354161336_10154747579616336 | We are tired of it to so let's vote her out for go.I can't believe the American people even want to vote for this pathetic criminal,pathetic human being.😀😁😂
17 | Sterling Dossett | 7 | 10154746354161336_10154747636861336 | They have set race relations back decades!!! Only BLM, police are being killed right and left with no repercussions--out of pure hate by thugs... Christianity has been spit upon and Christians have been treated like second class citizens...B.O. had a great chance to bring people together, but did the complete opposite!! We are all God's children---and need a leader who brings us together, not tear us apart!!! I AM SICK OF IT!!!!
18 | Hugo Duenas | 1 | 10154746354161336_1827070304204866 | The following letter addressed to Donald Trump I am sharing with you was written by a lady on another page. She asked readers to share it... feel free to do so... My open letter to Trump supporters. I know it is long but please read and take a second to think about it. The future of this country depends on it. Feel free to share! So You Want Someone To ‘Tell It Like It Is’? OK, Here You Go. 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin's puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals.3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade's cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said “ I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks.” Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person.4. You say you're patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution's limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin...etc5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton's history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can't ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional.8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem?9. I agree 100% if she's elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people’s money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home?11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin's little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right's anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country?12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said "Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,” and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillary's reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as "super-predators" in 1996? I don't agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don't care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.

21 | Calvin Frederick | 1 | 10154746354161336_10154747864776336 | What has the Republicans and the Republican party done in the years since bush to make America great? Republicans have been in charge of Congress for the last six years.  They block President Obama on everything so who is divided?
22 | Lee William | 3 | 10154746354161336_1600011213634346 | The republican shut down the government few years back.  The republican divided this nation.  No competencies with Obama they raided. Look at the old news cronicals . you need to do your. Home work. Maybe so.
23 | Mike Elia | 1 | 10154746354161336_1599991926969608 | Should Trump win, the president will call marshal law to prevent Trump from taking office. The corruption in this country is beyond the oval office and Hillary. There is a greater power that is calling the shots. They are all preparing for One World Order.
24 | David Christopher | 4 | 10154746354161336_10154747628806336 | Yeah, I'm sure with Trumps ignorance, hatred, anger, bigotry and racism. He'll bring our country together. It's just going to get worse. They've both shown NEITHER belongs in office. I'll take my chances with her lying, corruption over his angry, hatred, ignorant racism ANY day of the week. We're going to get screwed no matter who's in office. This whole election has been a disgrace to our country. Not looking forward to the next four years. You're going to start seeing racism come out of the woodworks, because of Trump. That's what he stands for. PERIOD!
25 | Mixhael L Villar | 0 | 10154746354161336_10154747853971336 | Remember WhenThe random sniper fire lieThis story might make Brian Williams feel a bit better. In March 2008, Clinton told a story about visiting Bosnia in 1996 with her daughter Chelsea: "I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base."A few days afterward, an unearthed video of the trip showed that no such thing happened. Clinton and her daughter were greeted by a young girl and met with a small ceremony, according to Reuters. Clinton soon admitted the mistake, saying "it proves I'm human."Though it wasn't an explosive lie, it was another small failure in a crumbling campaign, painting Clinton as untrustworthy. Just imagine what would happen if the same situation played out in a 2016 campaign.
