2 | Corey Yarmock | 423 | 10154766775571336_10154766786806336 | Hillary ran away from the rain today and will probably be bed ridden for a month. Trump came back against secret service wishes and finished his excellent speech üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
3 | Lukas Kindja | 179 | 10154766775571336_10154766789146336 | Trump is the Bull Moose, someone tried to assassinate him, failed, and Trump came back out on stage to say, "No one said this would be easy for us. But we will never ever be stopped."

He didn't have to run for president the guy is rich yet he puts himself in harms way for the American people!! He has created a movement like no other!! #DRAINTHESWAMP
8 | Rick Cramer | 55 | 10154766775571336_10154766790341336 | EVERY SINGLE act of violence at a rally or even has been committed by a or a group of democrats/liberal loons. SMH - karma will come out to play if they keep this crap up.
9 | Lee Fossey | 25 | 10154766775571336_10154766790851336 | CNN pundit says it was bound to happen because Trump invites violence at his rallies..Seriously !!!!!! üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°Firstly, it is paid HRC operatives that have incited violence at his rallies. Secondly, that's like saying the girl who wore the skirt asked to get raped üò§üò§. The brains on these people, GOD help us.
10 | Eric Snyder | 17 | 10154766775571336_10154766796411336 | WOW the professionalism of those secret service agents is top notch. They kept him covered the entire time. That guy that got him on stage put himself between a potential attacker and Donald J. Trump. That man is a Hero in my opinion. Much respect Secret Service. That was just really impressive to me.
11 | Carola Foster Wijas | 12 | 10154766775571336_10154766793546336 | And they say Republicans are the dangerous ones!! This couldn't of been a Hillary supporter right...because they are all about peace and love ya know!!

13 | Matt Ray | 6 | 10154766775571336_10154766796726336 | So sad Hillary is laughing at black people right to their faces and y'all can't see it. She doesn't think y'all are smart enough to talk politics so she holds a rap concert instead to gain your vote. Wake up America.
14 | Shonna Reiss | 12 | 10154766775571336_10154766790046336 | Fool comments on CNN. Liberals put your money where your mouth is and take on half of what this man has. I can't wait to vote for Trump and this just solidified it. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ #drainthatswamp.
15 | Kelly Berrigan | 15 | 10154766775571336_10154766790666336 | NBC News blamed Trump for this, and other violence...Fanning the Flames, they state.  They must have missed the Podesta emails from Wikileaks--where they are paying thugs to cause violence..ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE.
16 | Mark AndDana Neddeau | 0 | 10154766775571336_10154766802286336 | This is the hate on the left. This is the hypocrisy that sickening vulgar hypocrisy of Democrats and the left. Hillary Clinton supporters are sickening. When's the last time she had to be rushed off stage for anything but a coughing fit? When's the last time Secret Service had to carry her anywhere except her medical van? Disgusting.
17 | Donna Schreck Kolmer | 0 | 10154766775571336_10154766801701336 | Earlier Hillary was at a rally in Florida and it started to rain she ended her rally. Lol!! Secret service take Trump off the stage due to a threat from some moron and comes back after the guy is arrested and continues his rally. What's wrong with this picture???

19 | Sherry McEntee Butler | 0 | 10154766775571336_10154766798661336 | Talk about Pay for Play - Hillary will set up an unsecured server so other countries can hack confidential, secret, and top secret emails that she puts there in turn for a nice donation to the Clinton foundation and exorbitant speaking fees for her and Bill.  Not as clean as it looks, Hillary - no mistake here!

22 | Mike Brown | 12 | 10154766775571336_10154766787986336 | Im a moderate conservative who has voted Republican in every election since I could vote, this year I will NOT be voting for Trump. The extreme statements on immigration. The repulsive winks and nods towards racist sympathizers. The demeaning attitude toward women. The utter lack of understanding of the Constitution. Trump is a square peg conservatives are trying to fit into a round hole, and not only is it bad for America, it's potentially disastrous to the future of the conservative movement
23 | Dianne Johnson | 0 | 10154766775571336_10154766803671336 | this is how a true president acts, Trump returns to the stage after a threat, and killary runs because of a little rain, guess that proves even she knows that üí©melts when rain hits it,#Trump2016
24 | Tom Renick | 0 | 10154766775571336_10154766799141336 | Assassin ? Hillary has called Mr. Trump every vile name in the book and is responsible for inciting violent attacks. We the people were called deplorable by Clinton. She is crazy.
25 | Rocky Robinette | 0 | 10154766775571336_10154766802956336 | With the exception of JFK, every president assassinated was killed by a democrat. Ford and Reagan were shot by wacked out liberals, Trump needs serious protection from those idiots.

5 | Paula J Drummond | 0 | 10154765722351336_10154766800121336 | So here's the REAL story.Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers.copied from a post in Truth and Action by Marty Wolf, a Harvard Professor
6 | Sandy Grace von Nolting | 0 | 10154765722351336_10154766799711336 | I have to say I borrowed this post !! It was to good not to pass on , POINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary?
7 | Daniella Edward | 1 | 10154765722351336_10154766792951336 | Why is Trump rushed off stage at Nevada Rally?? He has been saying he fears nothing.

8 | Ray Rottler | 6 | 10154765722351336_10154766790216336 | A win is looking very good right now. As more comes out with Hillary and her corrupt Mafia style family, it's time to get America working again. It's time to unite this country. We can't fix a broken and corrupt Washington sending a corrupt woman like Hillary to the White House. If elected she would sell the Lincoln bedroom to the highest bidder. She is not above the law, and she needs to be shown the same.

2 | Zach Kerman | 69 | 10154764842381336_10154766672481336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
3 | Missy Smith Barrett | 44 | 10154764842381336_10154766675071336 | who cares send them elsewhere until we can care for our own vets and homeless citizens
4 | Jimmy Arellano | 3 | 10154764842381336_10154766704581336 | I see children, I don't see terrorist at least imagine how the Indian first saw u all coming over on ur boats !! But it's all good we will see what happens at the end of our time get ready
5 | Terry Brunning | 5 | 10154764842381336_10154766724151336 | Iraq has refugees coming here because we are involved in a war there that is displacing them. Presently we are fighting 7 wars. The solution is not to bring them to our country to be a burden on taxpayers but is to stop the wars. We can not be the worlds policeman nor can we rebuild Muslim nations.
6 | Ayman Cruise | 4 | 10154764842381336_10154766709981336 | Hillary is a lair and thiefShe supports terrorism and terrorists, she made ISIS with obamaOh american people wake up she will destroy America and all world if she win
7 | Tara Ducharme | 3 | 10154764842381336_10154766700791336 | Would it be easier  for you if you see them cutting a head off, or raping a small child. There did I make it easy for you now.
8 | Ralph Liberty | 3 | 10154764842381336_10154766759281336 | People better realize if Hillary wins she will bring over thousands and thousands of these potential terrorist refugees that they can not Vet properly .
9 | Andrea Grubb | 1 | 10154764842381336_10154766744461336 | That's what Hillary wants to do to try and take it back then create safe zones for these people. Once its save people can go back. She talked about it in the debate and how she plans on doing it. but I guess people don't care about that. Trump cares nothing about it.
10 | Roger Printy | 0 | 10154764842381336_10154766770601336 | obama and the dems. had it made when he was first elected they had total control just think of what they could have done to fix or country tax reform jobs better care for our seniors and veterans just think of what we could have had and we got obama care instead of any thing else they all ran for cover and lied to us if you ask people now how many voted for obama last time bet a lot will say they did  not vote for him i know i can not find any so how did he get elected a second time
11 | Bruce Paone | 3 | 10154764842381336_10154766708451336 | I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump. A fellow deplorable Trumpian!
12 | Lloyd Quincy Bishop CarMichael | 0 | 10154764842381336_10154766745631336 | The usual fear mongering by the GOP's racist right wing nativists! Are Canadians more intellgent than Americans? What method are they using that is beyond Americans expertise? Why then is the US pressuring other countries at the UN to help take in more refugees on humanitarian grounds?
13 | Bhavik Patel | 1 | 10154764842381336_10154766801541336 | Why don't ask the Gulf Countries to share responsibilities of refugee, nearly same culture, same language and practice same religious. These counties will be really helpful to them. As matter of fact they don't share any responsibilities at all, why only western countries need to take care of it.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chaker-khazaal/no-arab-gulf-countries-ar_b_8280448.html
14 | Alberto Ortiz | 1 | 10154764842381336_10154766707281336 | BREAKING NEWS!Trump at Reno Nevada, a few minutes ago:When trump has to say something like this: "If she were to win this election, ... it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis", 03 days to election day, it means one thing and one thing ony: Trump and his people are losing badly, really badly.Case closed.PD: When the trump's followers start barking at me it is because I'm walking on the right track. Any bullying will be reported to Melania. Thank you!
15 | Dan Gust | 0 | 10154764842381336_10154766721046336 | They claim they are vetting these refugees (a lot of whom have no papers) but claim the backgroind checks on gun buyers are broken...
16 | Susan Brereton | 1 | 10154764842381336_10154766755176336 | Amazing that Obama and spouse are so critical of Trump and his words, but ok to listen to rappers....How are those words any different !!!!!!
17 | Leslie Mccullough | 0 | 10154764842381336_10154766764606336 | AMEN! She gets it. It's not that we don't like Muslims. We have to face the fact that our economy as it sits cannot absorb all these refugees.
18 | Gabby Johnson | 0 | 10154764842381336_10154766703941336 | Why Donald Trump should never be president & commander in chief. Reason #55 (actually 1)Why doesn't Obama or didn't George W. Bush use the words "Radical Islamic Terrorism". Answer?: Maybe because American troops are in Muslim countries, working with Muslim allies, and you don't ramp up anti-American hysterics, putting your troops in danger. Most 10 year old's should be intelligent enough to figure this one out. But not Sean & The Donald.
19 | Pam De | 1 | 10154764842381336_10154766762011336 | If you can not vet and innoculate them do not bring them in. Return them and help them where the will be more comfortable. We do not need them and nor do they really want to be here and assimulate.
20 | Don Darkman | 0 | 10154764842381336_10154766693511336 | When Trump sends you his people.. He's not sending you his best people. He's sending white trash, rednecks, inbred hillbillies, kkk lovers, neo nazis...and some of them are good I guess??
21 | Ben Pike | 0 | 10154764842381336_10154766790811336 | I've worked with these people...they are no danger to anyone. They just want to be safe. These people don't support ISIS terrorism.

24 | Jamie Moffatt | 7 | 10154764842381336_10154766685786336 | We already have hungry and homeless Americans. How about helping them first before you start importing welfare cases.
25 | Wayne R Johnson | 9 | 10154764842381336_10154766675066336 | All you have to know about how hard Donald Trump will work for America, is look at how hard he has worked to get your vote. Trump has brought to the forefront "Real American Needs" and offered "real solutions and strategies". Hillary's response to Americas needs has been to launch relentless personal attacks on Donald Trump and his Deplorable's. She has offered little if any real solutions.MY vote is for "Solutions to the Issues" Donald Trump is presenting solutions!Trump/Pence(It's a package deal to success).

Why aren't you covering that part of the story? Why don't you become a real news organization and cover what's really going on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

9 | Anthony Cady | 44 | 10154765566336336_10154766542406336 | It doesn't matter because the DOJ is in Hillary's pocket and are going to ruin anything the FBI uncovers and/or never prosecute. Lynch the AG, former Bill Clinton appointee, Assistant AG Kadzik, Podesta's personal buddy...
10 | Patty Lang | 21 | 10154765566336336_10154766557411336 | SOMETHING should have been done by NOW! This is a Corrupt Government and NOTHING is being done about it! DOBB's is the BEST REPORTER!

It goes very deep within the circle of money between Saudi, Qatar, Morocco and the Clinton Foundation. Our government is a cesspool of corruption! Oh and Newt's book, Treason!
12 | Staci Napoli Dauphinais | 12 | 10154765566336336_10154766554941336 | Why no indictment now! Arrest her for lying to the FBI and sending classified emails to people with out proper clearances! Prosecutable to normal Joe Blows!
13 | Donna Rose Ireland | 10 | 10154765566336336_10154766554501336 | There was an article out saying Guliani saying he had sources telling him things was going to result in an investigation to find out who in the FBI is leaking info. Guliani has since scaled back what he said. I hope Klein recognizes that giving out info. from confidential sources could open up an investigation into that based on his interviews also.
14 | Hon Dike M Uzoukwu | 0 | 10154765566336336_1181224115277263 | Ed Klein! Why would Comey keep his job if he is found to have engaged to deny another person from serving. President Obama has an obligation and responsibility. Let us assume that an investigation is ordered against Director Comey, will he be asked to step down? If he pledge to fidelity is called into question, our trust on his loyalty to serve us fairly becomes an issue for he serves all Americans not political parties. I am afraid that the Witch hunt of the Clintons has now gone too far. Mayor Giuliani said that Trump have a bombshell against Hillary Clinton that will alter the elections. Surprisingly, it happened as Mayor Giuliani promised. How did he know what Comey will say in advance? It gives ordinary people pause. No one is perfect. Whatever makes Hillary Clinton made, she apologised already, so why can't we just get along and move on and pray to God to heal us from the scars of division?
15 | Kendra Rold | 16 | 10154765566336336_10154766575096336 | Angela Rold Lauren Flem really Obama wants to fire Comey...hmmm what are you afraid of Obama everyone might find out that you are just as much of a scumbag as the clintons!
16 | Crystal Rogers | 13 | 10154765566336336_10154766546306336 | the DOJ will block anything dealing with Hillary...and if by chance they do get around the DOJ..obama will pardon her or if she wins the election she will pardon herself and her whole crime family
17 | Angie Phifer | 6 | 10154765566336336_10154766555646336 | Yep....Ole Comey will be lucky IF he even has a job in 2017 !! He is being made a scapegoat because his feet have been put to the fire. Now they want to get rid of him because he has nowhere to turn. In with the Clinton Slush Foundation, and obligated as Director of the FBI to do his job. Sure glad I ain't in his shoes!! But that is what greed and the love of money will do for you. Sorry  Dude, but you brought it on yourself !!

What I‚Äôm about to tell you are only the facts ‚Äì historical facts, not rumors, not hearsay just plain undeniable facts.(This is only a small percentage of a much longer list)Of the two candidates running for president:Only Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress.Only Hillary Clinton was fired from a job for being unethical.Only Hillary Clinton ordered the deletion of over 30 thousand emails after she was ordered to hand the server containing them over to the Feds.Only Hillary Clinton got the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges and then laughed about it during an interview.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about Benghazi.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about her emails.Only Hillary Clinton lied about being under sniper fire after landing in Bosnia.Only Hillary Clinton lied about actually lying to the American people.Only Hillary Clinton was involved in ‚ÄúCash Cow ‚ÄúOnly Hillary Clinton nationally belittled her husband‚Äôs sexual harassment (and rape) accusers.Only Hillary Clinton is a career politician.Only Hillary Clinton will not release her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banks.Only Hillary Clinton is tied to Monsanto.Only Hillary Clinton was labeled ‚ÄúExtremely careless ‚Äúabout national security by the FBI.Only Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class. Surprising right? Watch the speech.Only Hillary Clinton benefited from the DNC rigging an election. Bernie never had a chance.Only Hillary Clinton had to return stolen items from the White House.Only Hillary Clinton said the Benghazi victim‚Äôs parents were lying.Only Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her based on her gender.Only Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI and found to have put national security at risk.Only Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place! Fact ‚Äì all facts!Only Hillary Clinton regularly cussed out and belittled her Secret Service detail.But you are going to vote for her because‚Ä¶. you don‚Äôt like Donald Trump? That is insane!I will never understand how any moral person in good conscience could vote for this woman.
4 | Sherry McEntee Butler | 13 | 10154765262016336_10154766453326336 | Talk about Pay for Play - Hillary will set up an unsecured server so other countries can hack confidential, secret, and top secret emails that she puts there in turn for a nice donation to the Clinton foundation and exorbitant speaking fees for her and Bill.  Not as clean as it looks, Hillary - no mistake here!

10 | Judi Wirtjes | 2 | 10154765262016336_10154766489446336 | Not all of them obviously. There are still far too many willing to vote for a career criminal that has committed crimes against America. I think they are the minority now, thankfully.
11 | Paula J Drummond | 4 | 10154765262016336_10154766460216336 | So here's the REAL story.Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS.

15 | Ken Woodward | 4 | 10154765262016336_10154766460386336 | only a few more days to find out....see if Hillary Bamboozeled her way into office by playing to the lesser informed Voters.
16 | Joshua Healy | 1 | 10154765262016336_10154766562366336 | I really hope Ben Carson is right. I'm very worried about this election. If Hillary wins, I'm almost definitely moving out of the country. Hillary Clinton will be the death of America.
17 | Tito Dhe Mali | 6 | 10154765262016336_10154766443241336 | To my big surprise I see in US a third world country propaganda style campaign by Mr Trump by telling people what they want to hear, 'promising them the moon, which is not for taking' - as they say in UK. The message has already been sent to the Washington establishment, loud an clear, but we must vote with our head using our common sense.. Hillary isn't an ideal choice, but voting for such a unreliable, unable and unsuitable character like Trump for the top job in the world, would be like stabbing ourselves in the back. Let's think rationally about this..

19 | Stevie Starr | 5 | 10154765262016336_10154766450481336 | Smart enough to know that Hillary is liar and she thinks she's above the law. It would be a disgrace to have her elected as President.
20 | Marsha Horner | 1 | 10154765262016336_10154766442226336 | Right. That's what we thought in the last 2 "elections". Corruption abounds in the liberal party and I would not put it past them to win this election by cheating. God help us all.
21 | Joe Federico | 1 | 10154765262016336_1137783193002255 | I hope your right Dr. Carson. 40 to 45% of this population are socialist liberals. I doubt there is any real intelligence there. They know not what they do.
22 | Jim Hawkins | 0 | 10154765262016336_1075444969221402 | Why in the world couldn't we have had a 1st black president that had the ethics,morals,character and integrity of Dr Ben Carson? Instead, we got a POS!

They nominated a reality tv star with no political experience, who lost $1 billion in one year, who cheated on at least 2 of his wives, talked about sexually assaulting women, can get into a four day argument with someone over a tweet, claimed bankruptcy 4 times, refuses to release his tax returns, is a deadbeat who doesn't pay service providers, and who is generally disliked by at least half of the country. The voters aren't that smart.

"You have to look at where the man is today and I think he's changed a lot in the last, especially, ten years."

3 | Wendy Brodersen Anderson | 109 | 10154764935201336_10154766367251336 | I'm so sick of people focusing on stupid things Trump said years ago. Who cares? Anyone who says that they have never said something sexist, racist or just plain stupid in the past is a liar. Guess who else is a liar? Don't vote for the liar! Vote Trump!

5 | Les Huff | 18 | 10154764935201336_10154766383111336 | If you look at Hilary she still doing the stuff she did in Arkansas but at a bigger scale. I pray none of her aids comes up missing. When they become a weak link they disappear or die.
6 | Teddy Hammonds Sublett | 25 | 10154764935201336_10154766400146336 | Trump loves America...he shows it at his rallies, and how he relates to the people....As he says "What do we have to lose?"

He dealt with Hillary in 1988 when the Rose Law firm came to their college to pitch them and he said there was such an evil aura about her he talked to them for 20 minutes and said he would get back to them. She threatned him that if he did not go their way. he would never get the financing

9 | Steven Sharpe | 5 | 10154764935201336_10154766435986336 | If you are against trump and want to hurt him then why not just vote for him just think all the money and luxury lifestyle he won't be able to go back too, instead of relaxing and playing golf building his business bigger and better, he will be growing America bigger and better, Trump2016 get out and vote!

11 | Jane Chew-Bentley | 3 | 10154764935201336_634051510108313 | DEAR GOP‚ÄúYou created the Trump candidacy. You unleashed a wave of hate of our first black president that swept through the Republican Senate and House. It washed over your party members, leaving an indelible stain of racism. Even as that black president was being sworn into office, you plotted to make sure Republicans would block anything that he proposed, no matter how reasonable or how badly needed. You made both your hate and obstruction respectable. Trump is a logical result. He is your man. You bought, and fed lies to your minions who now are his supporters. They were paid for and energized by you. The spectacle of a Trump candidacy is not "Making America Great Again", it is making America the laughing stock of the free world. The adolescent schoolyard bullying and gutter snipe rhetoric that he relishes are now being adopted by your other major candidates. What you, GOP, have given us is a race that looks more like a variety show or a death match fit for the Roman Colosseum than a campaign to elect the most powerful leader on earth.‚Äù - Pots, Pans, And Politics
12 | Rick Elbarolped Meadows | 2 | 10154764935201336_692658400908966 | He's changed just since he started in the primaries. His exposure to the stories by "regular" Americans has brought about a seriousness he didn't have in the primaries. He has seen how We the People have been treated and heard our stories and it has affected him in a good way. God bless him.

16 | Paula J Drummond | 9 | 10154764935201336_10154766377701336 | So here's the REAL story.Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers.copied from a post in Truth and Action by Marty Wolf, a Harvard Professor

24 | Phyllis Pearson Staten | 0 | 10154764935201336_634062703440527 | How can you dismiss what Trump said at the beginning of his campaign. He spewed so much racism and hatred. He can only focus on the wall, Blacks. Muslims and who Bill Clinton has done. He still haven't come up with his tax forms. He never says what will make America better cause he had no idea.When you wake up Wednesday we will have our 1st Female President

He is definitely a better man from all this.

Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers.copied from a post in Truth and Action by Marty Wolf, a Harvard Professor
8 | Rhonda Sanders Eads | 4 | 10154765560291336_10154766347266336 | I appreciate your coverage of the Presidential election, I am a Trump fan and am hoping and praying for a Trump victory! However, have you, or are you covering the situation in Dakota? What is going on there is so unAmerican! Is it even going to matter who gets elected? Can Fox News inform the American people on what's going on there? Or are they even allowing you to do so? It's horrific, and in my opinion much more important than this presidential election!!!
9 | Judy Atkinson Plachta | 1 | 10154765560291336_10154766553491336 | Tucker is ok but not prime time material. I miss Andrea, Gretchen and Greta. The Five is ruined for me now, can't stand Greg's drivel or Juan's nonsense. Miss On the Record, still enjoy O'Reilly except when Greg or Miller are on.
10 | Rick Solano | 7 | 10154765560291336_10154766292576336 | When Trump loses and his supporters riot the appropriate punishment would be to make them finish middle school.
11 | William Cogeos | 2 | 10154765560291336_10154766333951336 | Well paul, now that you will  not be watching FOX anymore after tuesday, you should try and tune into Rachel Maddow  for one week, she will try and explain why Trump lost, in terms even Trumpsters could understand.
12 | Paula J Drummond | 2 | 10154765560291336_10154766354711336 | The Europeanization of America.... bring the middle class down. Only have the  rich and the poor. Then the rich and the government have total control of the people. Wake the heck up America!! Take your country back or you won't have one. Close your borders and take care of your own people first. Bring the jobs back jobs and grow  your middle class. Washingtons gravy train has grown way to BIG. Drain that swamp! Vote Trump! It's our only chance. Who else is going to spend over a 100 million dollars of their own money to fund a campaign to help his country ...? Really Vote Trumpüá∫üá∏

Wants NYPD to hold this off till after the vote that is wrong we have a right to know. After this if Hillary wins no we elected a person who goes to a resorts that caters to this and does not turn it over to the law. God if this is true we are in trouble the DOJ is there to protect us know them. Why is the DOJ not protecting the rights of the under age kids if this is true and why are they not pulling her out till this issue is cleared up and will not let us not to know till after the election till it is too late? Is it so Hillary can dispose of their crimes and people, Type in Little Saint James Island off The Virginia Islands you will find it also in Google earth that is the place.
15 | Eileen Curran | 0 | 10154765560291336_10154766545251336 | Tucker! WOWIE!! If u persist as do most of Fox staff to always mess with the "conversation" by bringing on nastiness winners, like Juan,Julie,Geraldo, Professor Looney toones, Charlie G. the list  goes on and on.

17 | Leo Decaj | 7 | 10154765560291336_10154766291886336 | The crooked Hillary spends more money to lie to people  ,,then Trump,, so that means Hillary will spend and spend the tax payers money just like Obama.. looks like we going to be in deeper debt still.. But Trump looks out for our money,, so if your stupid enough to get higher taxes then Hillary is your ignorant choice... OR be Smart and Vote for Trump..
18 | David Courtney | 2 | 10154765560291336_10154766317556336 | Great move. Funny though that Tucker gets the same show that was hosted by Greta, who couldn't stand Tucker and stated he would never be welcome on her show again.
19 | Linda Jean Buonomo | 2 | 10154765560291336_10154766305396336 | On November 8th, EVERYTHING changes.Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American people.The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election.For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don‚Äôt have your good in mind.The political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry.The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries all around the world.It‚Äôs a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you. The only force strong enough to save our country is us.The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American people.I‚Äôm doing this for the people and the movement and we will take back this country for you and we will Make America Great Again.#TRUMP <3

21 | Brian Rule | 0 | 10154765560291336_10154766336381336 | Do you want God to forgive all your sins?, it is written in the bible: Repent of all your sins, and accept Jesus Christ as your Saviour, it's very simple, just repeat this short prayer: Father God, I recognize that I am a sinner, I repent of all my sins, i confess with my mouth that Jesus Christ is my Lord and my Saviour, and i believe God the Father raised Jesus from the dead, Jesus come into my heart right now, Amen. It is written in the bible: Romans 10: 9 That if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. And all your sins will be forgiven, God only forgives sins through Jesus Christ. I also invite you to a Christian church, and tell the pastor you want to accept Christ into your heart, and he will pray with you and you will be saved, Jesus Christ loves you, God bless you.
22 | Rita Kirsch Thieme | 0 | 10154765560291336_10154766480206336 | This is great news. I saw Tucker's broadcasts and he clearly has genuine affection for his guests. He'll do well, I'm sure.
23 | John Henry | 13 | 10154765560291336_10154766299721336 | The 40th governor of Illinois (Rod Blagojevich) is currently serving 14 years in prison for running a "pay for play" scheme to fill the senate seat vacated by Obama in 2008. That's 14 years for 1 "pay for play" violation. Hillary has committed more violations than we can even count between her State Department and the Clinton Foundation, so why isn't she running for president from behind prison bars???
24 | Carol DeAngelis | 2 | 10154765560291336_10154766301641336 | Will enjoy seeing you in the evenings but will definitely miss you on Saturday mornings.  Congratulations!

Today on "FOX & Friends Weekend," David Webb talked about how Americans feel right before the vast majority of voters head to the polls.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Liana Cross | 255 | 10154764782516336_10154766196271336 | Quite Honestly!....I am sick of the Government telling me how much insurance I need and taking half my income to suit their wishes!! No wonder people quit working and just collect Food Stamps!!! They're sick of funding the habits of the RICH and eating Peanut Butter to survive!!
2 | Deborah L. Reed | 149 | 10154764782516336_10154766196146336 | I am getting that sinking feeling again... I just can't imagine a term of CLinton's again... I can't believe we are going to suffer for 4 years... day in and day out of divisive rhetoric and  corruption..
3 | Marlon Chowthi | 53 | 10154764782516336_10154766196456336 | Like the next VP (Mike Pence) said "Its time for Republicans to come home" and they will restore freedom liberty and justice for all. No more protecting politicians for their wrong doings.
4 | Henry Best | 38 | 10154764782516336_10154766207301336 | The liberal democrats are failing, nobody buying their lies anymore! When crooked Hillary loses on Tuesday, the Democratic Party will be out of power for many years to come.
5 | Bryan Smith | 38 | 10154764782516336_10154766202526336 | Debra you must not have a doom and gloom attitude you need to be positive everything is going to be fine Donald Trump is going to win the presidency and turn this country around and put it back on the right track !!! But it's up to you and every other American to get out on November 8 Tuesday leave your home stand in line be patient cast your vote for Donald Trump along with the other Republican candidates we must hold onto the house and the senate that way Donald Trump will have an easier time of it to make things happen !!!
6 | Steve Kutra | 14 | 10154764782516336_10154766217196336 | Me, too. They have no idea what my life is like. Not only do the wealthy have no idea, they don't care. President FDR did and his wife and I think maybe Trump does.
7 | Stephen Mckiernan | 24 | 10154764782516336_10154766198726336 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.
8 | Gerard Dela Cruz | 13 | 10154764782516336_10154766239641336 | This brother sees through the BS, I guess he is not the Emotionalist type... He's an Intelligent man who've seen the Inner cities worsen.  He's seen that this Country has too much Gov control.  He is sticking with the issues at hand... He realized Jay Z and Beyonce don't put food on the table. Neither do they put roof over his head!!... They can't sing and dance over this Countries Issues!!  Big up My Brother!!
9 | Michael Packer | 3 | 10154764782516336_10154766222266336 | What i see here is a bunch of unhappy Americans. Clinton and Trump are both no good. It is time for the American citizens to take back the country before it is too late.
10 | Scott Christensen | 8 | 10154764782516336_10154766213271336 | 100% right. I'm tired of hearing Politician/Lawyers tell me that "This is what America is about", and "This is what it means to be an American". I don't believe in bringing in unskilled refugees who will just be a drain on our economy while they collect welfare, and I do believe in my Constitutional right to bear arms! That differs from what our government believes.
11 | Lola Morgan | 1 | 10154764782516336_10154766247446336 | It's not just the politicians, seems to be people in general,piping their opinions,giving orders. Seems I can't even use my debit card at a business, without some broad, or stud telling me.how.to do it. I may be 84 , but am not stupid. I told a.lady just this week,"keep your trap shut,.or you will be eating this card." Every electronic.device does not work perfectly,everytime, have to re_enter card, but , might know, some floosy,untidy,female,behind me will tell me how to do it. Not my first RODEO.
12 | Don Cloud | 4 | 10154764782516336_10154766255871336 | Well,a lot are and the others that I see clapping behind Hillary at her campaign rallies are actually applauding a criminal. Would those same supporters walk into a prison and clap for the inmates? I doubt it. Think about that for a moment.
13 | Lois Chears | 9 | 10154764782516336_10154766203586336 | Some Democrats, Bernie supporters, African American and Hispanics now registered Republicans voting Trump/Pence. Some early voters are changing their vote to Trump/Pence. People are waking up. Glad to have you in the regular redneck basket of irredeemable deplorables. Drain the swamp. Make America Great Again. Trump/Pence November 8, 2016.
14 | Clive Peddle | 1 | 10154764782516336_10154766214681336 | So if Clinton wins that must mean that Americans aren't sick of the so called elite and political class. Look. Hillary's awful but if you think Trump will be a good president then God help America.
15 | Michael Ballard | 3 | 10154764782516336_10154766261156336 | Lies, Deception, and Corruption, OBAMA and Hillary Clinton's offer to the people of America.ANDThe promise of more free stuff to the"give me free stuff" people that vote for a living.ANDAnd the MEDIA just promote, feed, and accept her LIES....
16 | Danny Daniels | 1 | 10154764782516336_10154766331431336 | He may be right, but Trump and his team of misfits are all unfit. "I never thought he had the temperament of a 2-year-old,‚Äù said former Trump supporter Lori Goldberg Burch. Nothing else matters when you have such a poor temperament. Vote Hillary
17 | Rocky Robinette | 3 | 10154764782516336_10154766210051336 | People are sick of career criminals running our government. People are pissed off that the checks and balances are in on the corruption. We the people are running out of options, it's coming down to the 2nd Amendment.
18 | Ray Rottler | 8 | 10154764782516336_10154766194306336 | And to support Hillary is supporting corruption. You can't fix Washington sending another corrupt person into office. If she was to be elected she would have the Lincoln bedroom for sale to the highest bidder. She should never be allowed to run, and she should never be around classified information again!
19 | Frank Ferlito | 2 | 10154764782516336_10154766249636336 | I don't no if you can see him but he is a black very intelligent man, I keep warning you blacks and latino's she is telling you what you want to hear and if she gets in she will through you away like a dirty dish towel open your eye's
20 | Lee Preston Shattuck | 2 | 10154764782516336_10154766226696336 | That is the Sa√∫l Alinsky doctrine (Hillary's mentor) ... to turn everyone dependent on government and aimless blobs so they can be 'manipulated' .... Trump for President!
21 | Brad Seale | 0 | 10154764782516336_10154766425981336 | The overwhelming majority of overreach by the fed govt is accomplished by utilizing the reinterpreted commerce clause. This will be addressed at CONVENTION OF STATESThis is a nationwide effort by the states to implement an Article V, which will address term limits(legislative and judicial), fiscal constraints, and limitations on federal power and jurisdiction.

22 | Earl Nicholas | 2 | 10154764782516336_10154766327396336 | There is a cancer in this country  it's destroying our churches our schools our government our Constitution our way of lifeWe need to take back the country and restore the values it was founded on and rid our country of this cancerWe must remove the leeches on our society  and send them back to where they came from They didn't care enough about their own country to stay and try to make things better for their people  they came here illegally to ride on the American wallet and destroy this country Vote Trump
23 | James Rozman | 1 | 10154764782516336_10154766424971336 | Yep, praying the Holy One of Israel reveals the whole truth about Clintons, Obama WH Administration, the DNC, and the Congressional members involved in the deceptions and corruption by Monday, allowing all of them to reap what they have sown the past thirty plus years.
24 | Ronnie Leccese | 3 | 10154764782516336_10154766232256336 | The great unwashed, uneducated basket of deplorables are on to you our corrupt government. We want you out, we  want term limits and NO MORE lobbyists.
25 | Len Larsen | 3 | 10154764782516336_10154766234711336 | These are the teachings of Saul Alinsky that Hillary Clinton and Obama follow! How do I know? I researched. I found that Obama wrote about Saul in his books. Hillary wrote about him in her thesis. Does any of this scare you?There are eight levels of control that must be obtained before you can create a social state:1. Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! What do you see? Before you deny its not true,...How did Saul Alinsky know the U.S. was heading toward a Social State 46+ years ago? It's a good question to think about!!!Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"! Wake up and Vote for Trump, he is our only hope to rid our country of the stinking rotten corruption!Help make our country great again

4 | Jessie Madden | 7 | 10154763217926336_10154766185576336 | Do a story on AT&T ripping people off. AT&T is pure evil. Back in may we upgraded to the direct tv and unlimited wireless plan because we were told for that and our phones our bill would be less then $300. So of course we switched. That was a flat out lie. So now since may I have to call and get put Bill lowered to the correct price. Today I spent 3 hours almost on the phone being hung up on while I waited for supervisors and being told there was nothing they could do. Quinton at the Ruston Louisiana store flat out lied to us and AT&T is not even sorry and refuses to honor what we were quoted. So we will be canceling soon and no longer giving our money to such evil. If you decide to try and trust AT&T read the papers, and don't be surprised when your bill is almost $100 what you were quoted. I'm not the only one. There are so many stories of the same thing about AT&T just Google them.

The mainstream media don't mind when people like Jay Z and Hillary Clinton use this term?!? So look, I'm a nigga/negro. And as a nigga/negro, I support Donald Trump. I can't wait to see what he will do for African Americans that have been treated so unfairly by Democrats. African Americans that have been exploited of their votes by corrupt Democrats. Polls show that Trump's support amongst African Americans doubles that of Mitt Romney from the last elections. This speaks volume. Trump cares about ALL Americans, and he wants ALL Americans to live the American dream. This is important to me because I also have an American dream. Trump Train will clean up Washington DC. #NiggaForTrump

10 | Len Larsen | 2 | 10154765984801336_10154766248571336 | These are the teachings of Saul Alinsky that Hillary Clinton and Obama follow! How do I know? I researched. I found that Obama wrote about Saul in his books. Hillary wrote about him in her thesis. Does any of this scare you?There are eight levels of control that must be obtained before you can create a social state:1. Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! What do you see? Before you deny its not true,...How did Saul Alinsky know the U.S. was heading toward a Social State 46+ years ago? It's a good question to think about!!!Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"! Wake up and Vote for Trump, he is our only hope to rid our country of the stinking rotten corruption!Help make our country great again

The 4.9 percent unemployment rate is half of what it was in the depths of the recession in 2009. On Friday, in its monthly employment report, the Department of Labor said that average hourly wages jumped 2.8 percent, to $25.92, in October from a year earlier, the biggest such increase since 2008.Add these findings to a recent report from the Census Bureau showing a decline in the number of people in poverty and the percentage of people without health insurance, and it is clear that by almost every economic measure the country is doing better than it was just a few years ago.Mr. Trump refuses to acknowledge these truths"
22 | Lynn Roberge | 3 | 10154765984801336_10154766304606336 | It‚Äôs so imperative for people to understand one thing about Donald Trump, he is not running for office to increase his salary or net worth. If anything, he has spent a lot of his own money on the entire campaign and Crooked Hillary has NOT. He's not a politician and because of that he's not politically correct and corrupt like most of the politicians in Washington. Trump really loves this country and the people in it and he knows that he is the only chance we have at a country that is free again, whose morals and values parallel those of our founding fathers. This country was built by God loving folks who wanted change - that‚Äôs exactly what Donald Trump is. He is not controlled by the special interests and the evil media and does not heed the negative stigmas that are placed upon him. He is driven by only one thing ‚Äì he knows that this country needs dire change and he is the only shot we‚Äôve got to save our country. So please, on November 8th ‚Äì go vote and go make a difference in this country. Aren‚Äôt you tired of the growing control the government has on our lives and the ALL the corruption and lies? It‚Äôs time to take our Country back. Trump/Pence üá∫üá∏
23 | brian steele | 0 | 10154765984801336_10154766350626336 | Here‚Äôs what Trump supporters don‚Äôt seem to understand:1) CONTROVERSIES AREN'T THAT BAD: The things Hillary‚Äôs accused of aren‚Äôt as massive or consequential as conservatives claim. Using a private server wasn‚Äôt a malicious act. At worst, it was foolish and secretive, but everyone from Jeb Bush to Scott Walker to Colin Powell to Marco Rubio have used private emails in some fashion. Yes, Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State when the Benghazi embassy was attacked, and we lost 4 lives, but prior to Benghazi there have been 13 embassy attacks with 60 deaths and the Secretary of State wasn‚Äôt blamed. While there were details to parse, it is a risky job serving in dangerous countries for the State Dept., and lives are at risk. Blaming H. Clinton is just a cheap way to pretend that the world isn‚Äôt a dangerous place, and try to smear her.2) NEVER BEEN PROVEN GUILTY OF SQUAT: She has never been indicted for anything. Frankly, she is remarkably clean. The emails that have come out have shown a savvy politician. Pay to play? Not really. She knows people, and influence peddling is a part of that job, but there have been untold investigations over the years into the Clintons, and if you don‚Äôt wade down the conspiracy well, the worst they‚Äôve come up with is that Bill couldn‚Äôt keep his dick in his pants. They are politicians. Good politicians. Are they perfect? Hell no, but to withstand the assault they‚Äôve faced for three decades and come out this clean is remarkable.3) THEIR WORST VERSION OF HILLARY IS STILL BETTER THAN TRUMP: Even if Hillary was guilty of the things she‚Äôs accused of, she‚Äôs still a much better choice than a racist, megalomaniacal and stupid demagogue with a narcissistic personality disorder that has sexually assaulted women and then bragged about it to an Access Hollywood host. Even if she did delete emails and not send in troops to Benghazi, even if she is a corrupt and morally bankrupt politician, she would still be better than the cartoon dictator the other party has presented. That is what the Trump supporters, with their feverish swoons over ‚Äúemails,‚Äù don‚Äôt seem to understand. She may be a shady politician, but Donald Trump is everything bad and wrong with our country, and cannot be allowed anywhere near real power. Period.

7 | Gary Doan | 119 | 10154765923206336_10154765924801336 | We have witnessed the largest, most elaborate political coverup in history. Obama's Department of Justice, the Mass Media, the DNC and Hillary Clinton have almost succeeded, by attacking Trump. Their defense, was to go on offense and they flooded the media, with claims of violence, even rape. The violence was found to be planned and instigated by paid Team Hillary goons, who even rehearsed before hand. Their offense was all staged and fake. It‚Äôs all fake, the fake rape lawsuit was even dropped the week before the election. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt, dishonest politician to ever run for office.
8 | Lois Chears | 58 | 10154765923206336_10154765945946336 | Obama and Hillary seem desperate and angry. They didn't count on being exposed. Corruption flows downhill and it starts at the top.

Point is just with fed taxes and health care cost, you will be living of 25%of your income not including new state taxes and property taxes, gas taxes, utility taxes, cell phone taxes, the rise in food prices will sky rocket to cover those cost for most employers. Before you even cash your check and Pay rent or Morgage or your car note .

But maybe you have a better sense on how all the protesters against him caused riots during his stay.. We're going to work by including Mexico as our main assets on 2017 budget drafting.  Lower the taxes unlike Hillary & businesses will stay in America!Increasing taxes will eventually have big corporations leave us.. This way it'll bring us back a primary surplus! So then he can help the president of Mexico bring back jobs to his country & his people! Wall is part of the treaty.. How come Clinton needs celebrities too obtain assurances the ones voting for her don't slip away... Then again she could of rigged some ballots...

3 | Giulio Braga | 111 | 10154765110896336_10154765816521336 | Well‚Ä¶ the first female president should be someone to be proud of, not a felon who cheated and lied. She will be more remembered for her scandals than for being the first female president. Is Trump perfect? no, he isn't, but clinton is who will make your life a real hell. Think about it.

4 | Bruce Heslop | 36 | 10154765110896336_10154765815876336 | The reason why Wiener came into play in this is bcs he was suspected for Child porn and low and behold Clinton emails :)
5 | Zach Kerman | 43 | 10154765110896336_10154765814426336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?

7 | Corrine Winckler Fritz | 8 | 10154765110896336_10154765848961336 | Trump says this to a crowd of people who don't understand that "probably" does NOT, mean "did"; that citing "sources familiar with the case" is NOT the same as citing "sources directly involved with the case"; that opinion and speculation is NOT the same as facts, proof, or evidence. Look at Trump repeatedly claiming Hillary is about to be indicted with no PROOF to support that claim. Look at Trump claiming President Obama yelled at and berated a Trump supporting heckler when President actually stood up for the protester's right to free speech, treating the likely veteran with dignity and respect. If Trump lies about the small stuff, how can you trust him on the big stuff?
8 | James Elliott | 1 | 10154765110896336_10154765961536336 | According to multiple sources, after the NYPD confiscated Anthony Weiner's laptop which was filled with Huma Abedin's emails they continued their search and discovered the property of Hillary Clinton in the form of emails that implicated her and Bill in the most heinous and serious crimes.  An NYPD source just claimed that within the emails on that device, Hillary and Bill are directly implicated ins a MASSIVE child sex/trafficking ring along with their friend, and convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. According to the source, ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs much more vile and serious than classified material on Weiner‚Äôs device. The emails DETAIL the trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary on their pedophile billionaire friend‚Äôs plane, the Lolita Express.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking an international child enslavement and sex ring‚Äú These claims were backed up by other NYPD sources as well: Jeff Epstein is a level-3 registered sex offender and the media ignores the fact hat Bill Clinton flew 26 times on Epstein‚Äôs private Jet and allegedly visited Epstein‚Äôs sex slave island. Now that Hillary has also been directly implicated, the media cannot ignore this any longer! The NYPD source makes specific claims about her involvement. He says, ‚ÄúHillary has a well documented predilection for underage girls, and Mr. Weiner could not bear to see those details deleted.‚Äù http://redstatewatcher.com/article.asp?id=46461

She's good, but she's not magical and the naysayers are buying into the lies. Thank goodness Beyonce and J understand the long term implications of not having a prepared and intelligent leader.

She dwarfs what is happening in South Korean just now. There the people are out on the streets, but not in th eUS.

6 | Zaya Shiba | 1380 | 10154765663521336_10154765752071336 | Worst Secretary of State of all time. You're a flip flopper, you don't really care about minorities or women's rights, all you care about is pleasing your bosses.
7 | Peter Steiner | 844 | 10154765663521336_10154765759701336 | I was asked how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste from a fellow deplorable Trumpian.

15 | Yvonne Lane | 180 | 10154765663521336_10154765749526336 | Father God, we pray that in this election, Your children will get out and vote. We pray for spiritual wisdom now for people to see and to know who they will vote for. We pray that evil will not win in any county, in any state, and in any of the higher office of the land. Father, we pray that the truth will come out, and that any candidate in any of these races across the country, that have any ill will gains for their purpose to get into office for any position will not succeed. We pray that only the true, the humble, and the good hearted people will succeed in this election. Lord, we know that the ones we want to win are all not believers, but pray that one day they will run into Your Son Jesus and have their lives transformed for ever as He did for us. We pray that all of Your children across the globe will in the next few days get on their knees, surrender to You, weep for our country, and repent. Lord this is Your land and we ask You to heal our nation. Bring us out of "Egypt", bring us out of "wilderness" where we have been wandering in circles, and bring us to the "Promise Land". We pray for the Holy Spirit to go across this nation like the wind and start a revival. For men and women of God stand up and say "No More!" We will not allow evil to prevail, we will not sit back and let our brothers and sisters be persecuted, we will not let our babies be killed in the womb, and we will not turn our cities and country into Sodom and Gomorrah. Father, thank You for giving us a voice. Thank You for giving us the right to vote. Thank You for all of those who have died for our freedoms and voting privileges. We all come together as God's children, the chosen saints, to declare this election and this day. "Chose today for yourselves, whom you will serve? For me and my household, we will serve the Lord" We collectively pray this in Your Son's Precious and Holy Name, The Name above all names, the King of kings, The Lord of lords, our Teacher, the Lover of our souls, the Christ - Jesus Christ, Amen! HallelujahSoli Deo Gloria - Glory to God Alone!

They are lying, dirty cheats willing to sell out America for personal enrichment. I thought democrats overcame that stigma however it is as true today as it was 150 years ago and even prior to that. No morals whatsoever.

20 | Jerry Livernois | 109 | 10154765663521336_10154765761711336 | Thought for the day: would you rather put your children on a school bus driven by somebody who has 30 years of experience but has had multiple accidents and has a criminal background or would you rather put your child on a school bus with a new driver? Think about that. A vote for Hillary Clinton is like voting for that bus driver who has had multiple accidents and a criminal background. You are entrusting the future of your children and your grandchildren to this woman if she wins. If you were voting for Hillary, stop-and take a minute and think about that....#trump2016
21 | Jim Crane | 89 | 10154765663521336_10154765760496336 | Well‚Ä¶ before you cast your ballot on Election Day, take a long, hard look at your looming insurance premiums and ask yourself, ‚ÄúWho can make America‚Äôs healthcare affordable again?‚ÄùRemember the promise made by President Obama?‚ÄúIf you like your health care plan, you‚Äôll be able to keep your health care plan ‚Äì period,‚Äù he said.That‚Äôs what he promised to folks.Many liked his health care plan ‚Äì but because of ObamaCare they won‚Äôt be able to keep their healthcare plan.‚ÄúIn an Obama administration, we‚Äôll lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year,‚Äù he said.But thanks to ObamaCare, the family‚Äôs premiums will have skyrocket increases next year.Instead of delivering on his promises to the American  families, the president handed them a wheel barrel full of Grade-A fertilizer.And if you think your insurance premiums are too expensive now, just watch what happens if Hillary Clinton gets the keys to White House.So before you cast your ballot on Election Day, take a long, hard look at your looming insurance premiums and ask yourself, ‚ÄúWho can make America‚Äôs healthcare affordable again?‚ÄùThank you-

Aye, fight and you may die. Run, and you'll live... at least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willin' to trade ALL the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take...

4 | Tony Harrison | 1797 | 10154765603591336_10154765619526336 | Pretty much. Especially when Michelle Obama stated that Trumps comments shook her to her core, yet she invites convicted felons/rappers to the White House. Smh.

God help us if Mr. Trump even thought of some of the words that these two, and others, use on a daily basis. These are the people that Moochella lauds as "role models" for young people!

12 | Dickie Cox | 148 | 10154765603591336_1180408135387504 | That's right, Trump said the word P***y, on an audio, 11 yrs ago, and the Left went crazy... Michelle Obama said she has girls to raise and that was inappropriate for them, next night after a show said Beyonce was a role model. Half naked, female, shaking booty hole to audience. How many times did Jay Z say N***a?, and curse words?, all applauded the entertainment. This is the epitome of what has to change in this country.
13 | KS Valenti | 131 | 10154765603591336_1115426921844147 | Mr Trump, my baby sister is coming to vote for you on Nov 8th in Ohio. She will be attached to her chemo-machine, being treated for stage 4 cancer. She is bringing the machine with her. She's hoping to get a ride from one of her friends. I live in Minnesota, so it will not be me taking her. I want you to know how important it is to her that you become the next President of the United States. #TRUMP2016
14 | Clint Kelfer | 98 | 10154765603591336_10154765619636336 | It is. She damns Trump for using "bad" words and saying bad things yet endorses people who actually lived by the words they speak
15 | Jeff Lee | 81 | 10154765603591336_10154765619261336 | I don't know who is more pathetic, Hilary Clinton or Jay Z. Hilary Clinton, in a desperate attempt to lure the black vote breaks out Jay Z ?? How fuc$ing pathetic !!!
16 | Brittany Rolland | 82 | 10154765603591336_1184378554969583 | How is Hillary winning? I know nobody that supports her. She draws 100s to her rallies. Trump draws 100s of thousands. When they go live all I see are angry or laughing emojis for her and either hearts or thumbs up for him. She has to use celebrities to draw people in... and even then Trump still kills her numbers... please explain this to me
17 | Forrest Gowdy | 76 | 10154765603591336_1754969411433832 | So worried about what Trump says with children watching but your ok with the racist cop hating Jay Z preforming at her rallies!! Media where's the reporting on this??? ABC,cbs, NBC , CNN , crooked media!!
18 | Peggy Sellers | 86 | 10154765603591336_10154765619731336 | it's a shame that Hillary needs celebrities to get people to vote for her...(or do they?) Why do celebrities and their candidates think we are lemmings who follow blindly? When candidates and celebrities use each other to get people to vote for them they do the American voter a real dissservice. I am not stupid! I vote with my heart, soul and conscientious...not because some celebrity is stumping for them!
19 | Ana Consuelo | 49 | 10154765603591336_10154765630241336 | Hillary IS SO UNFIT and has NO MESSAGE that she has to have rappers and stars come out.  I think it will backfire. The American people are the stars at Donald Trump's rallies!!!!!Make America GREAT Again!
20 | Christine Mitchell Saris | 52 | 10154765603591336_1115435131843326 | I'm Not the author of this but it is too good not to share..... "Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn‚Äôt make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, ‚ÄúTrump is arrogant.‚Äù My friend questioned if one man could make ‚Äúthat much difference in the world today.‚Äù To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, ‚ÄúReally, what has Trump done?‚ÄùI said, ‚ÄúIn June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren‚Äôt properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it‚Äînews now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren‚Äôt liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees‚Äîif you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to ‚Äúliberals.‚ÄùAs the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he‚Äôs not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk‚Äîmeaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ‚ÄùAt this point, what do you have to lose?‚Äù We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year‚Äîone guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I‚Äôve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we‚Äôre in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That‚Äôs your right. Just don‚Äôt ever say he‚Äôs not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh‚Äôs News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise ‚Ä¶ and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase‚Äîthey're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America‚Äôs problem isn‚Äôt that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it‚Äôs high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they‚Äôre not simply the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù as you‚Äôve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them ‚Äúdeplorables.‚Äù The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year."

"The black community knows that you have racism on both sides."

Leslie Wimes, founder of the Democratic African-American Women's Caucus, joined "FOX & Friends Weekend" to discuss African-American turnout for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Chris Suggs | 834 | 10154764774916336_10154765441366336 | Here's a real fact for Black democrats. All of the slaves owned in America were owned by a democrat. The Republican Party was created to free the slaves and let them earn money not keep them in poverty
2 | Terrence McGoldrick | 471 | 10154764774916336_10154765440671336 | The inner cities are being crushed by Obama's policies. I don't know why anyone would want another four years of the last eight crushing policies and horrifying years.
3 | John Henry | 257 | 10154764774916336_10154765449326336 | actually, the black community is starting to use their brains. They realize that Donald Trump was never accused of racism until he started running for president. They also realize that Trump has way too many high profile black endorsements to be a racist. And they also realize that Trump is their real ticket to economic prosperity, and they're tired of the democratic lies that have been repeated over and over for decades!
4 | Jesse Goodman | 181 | 10154764774916336_10154765444601336 | Obama and Hillary will promise the Black American's the Moon, but all you gonna get is Talk, Neither have or will keep their word. I can Not vote for Hillary.
5 | Lois Chears | 74 | 10154764774916336_10154765454666336 | Some Democrats, Bernie supporters, African American and Hispanics now registered Republicans voting Trump/Pence. Some early voters are changing their vote to Trump/Pence. People are waking up. Glad to have you in the regular redneck basket of irredeemable deplorables. Drain the swamp. Make America Great Again. Trump/Pence November 8, 2016.
6 | Michael Keith Fordham | 55 | 10154764774916336_10154765444166336 | Hillary and Obama have proved the racist policies and double standard by the left. With all the proof of lies and cover-ups fir anyone who does vote for her your either racist or biased.
7 | Cory Alexander | 52 | 10154764774916336_10154765504016336 | Racism actually exists on the dems side. Hilary idolizes a woman who started an organization you may have heard of called planned parenthood. The woman she idolizes created that program to exterminate minorities and impure blood lines. As for the Republican side, well the only racism there is what big media was paid to say is there. Wanting illegals out and un vetted refugees out is not racist.
8 | Tempest Lee Reres | 57 | 10154764774916336_10154765456956336 | African American's need to wake up and open there eyes to what the Dem party has done to them for years. All i have ever heard from most of them are that Republican party is racist. Do they not know that Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves and he was a Republican . The Dems have poisoned the minds of them. The picture is so clear and i just don't understand why they don't see this. All the states that are blue states have the most poverty than the red states. Wake up everyone and make this vote count. TRUMP/PENCE will Make everyone's America Great Again. He is the only one who has given the American People a voice for once!!!!
9 | Lois Chears | 47 | 10154764774916336_10154765460346336 | Obama and Hillary seem desperate and angry. They didn't count on being exposed. Corruption flows downhill and it starts at the top. It reaches as far as other countries. Democrats and Republicans are worried about Trump becoming POTUS and exposing all of them.
10 | Tammy Mccoy | 28 | 10154764774916336_10154765532741336 | So let me get this straight, America is $19 TRILLION in debt and Barack Obama is spending Millions of taxpayers dollars to actively campaigning for a candidate who is now currently twice under a criminal investigation by the FBI. Barack Obama will one day answer to the American people. The scariest part isn't the corrupt cronies but the millions of Americans who don't care and will still vote for Hillary Clinton.
11 | Albert Hebert | 17 | 10154764774916336_10154765525401336 | Totally correct. Hillary would have done better using the confidence game. Seeing President Obama , Joe Biden , and even Katy Perry doing multiple stops A day looks Desperate for sure.
12 | Dennis Gould | 27 | 10154764774916336_10154765561051336 | Deplorables, Needy Latinos, Taco Bowl, Basement Dwellers and Super Predators. Those aren't Trump words. They're offensive Hillary Clinton and DNC words used to categorize entire groups of people. Hillary says that Trump should be nice to people? Perhaps she should look in the mirror and lead by example.
13 | Jimmy Smith | 28 | 10154764774916336_10154765506196336 | I'm asking everyone to share the post "Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn‚Äôt make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, ‚ÄúTrump is arrogant.‚Äù My friend questioned if one man could make ‚Äúthat much difference in the world today.‚Äù To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, ‚ÄúReally, what has Trump done?‚ÄùI said, ‚ÄúIn June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family. Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren‚Äôt properly installed using proper law. Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it‚Äînews now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect. Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren‚Äôt liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall." Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees‚Äîif you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage. Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to ‚Äúliberals.‚ÄùAs the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he‚Äôs not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct. What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk‚Äîmeaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.

14 | Dexter Franklin | 15 | 10154764774916336_10154765597046336 | Pres Jackson was a slave owner and a Democrat, southern Democrats founded the KKK, southern Democrats were for Jim Crow laws and against the civil rights act. Democrat run cities are rampant with crime and corruption. Why do you black folks still vote Democrat?
15 | Christina Sisneros | 15 | 10154764774916336_10154765566361336 | Hillary is acting like this election is a run for president in the High school student council handing out free tickets for a concert just to get vote from African Americans! !! Does she think they are that stupid sure they took the tickets they were free but that's the only reason! !!! Grow up Hillary things don't work that way! ! ! !
16 | Jerry Berard | 9 | 10154764774916336_10154765505746336 | If the democratic socialist party was doing anything for black people then why are they in jail ,on welfare and in low income housing,! I'll tell you why ! They want to control you and keep you on the plantation so to say !As long as they train people not to work and on the plantation they will keep the vote ! Republicans want to get people out of the slums and give them the tools to succeed
17 | Diana Lavallee Pickard | 6 | 10154764774916336_1772544329661167 | If you were born in America, no matter your color, you are an AMERICAN!  Only African born who became American citizens can use the two word label.  I strongly feel if our black community dropped African American and became just Americans as that is who you truly are, a lot of negativity would go away.
18 | Terry Blanton | 6 | 10154764774916336_1772540976328169 | The thing is, I have never heard a liberal black, man or woman, say anything that wasn't racist.  Just as I've never heard a damocrap in government make a speech where they didn't tell one group of Americans to hate another group.  In the '60s and before. damocraps used to tell whites to hate blacks; now it's telling everyone to hate Christians and republicans.
19 | Marco Joan Caiani | 3 | 10154764774916336_1772577709657829 | Listen lady racism is everywhere do you think that you black people are not racist? I mean really, are you saying that blacks are racist against whites because of what happened 200 plus years ago and because some, much fewer people are racist today. You will not eliminate racism completely if a person's heart is wicked that's how it is black or white hatred is in both. Stop this crap about whites only being racist. There are probably more blsck racists today than white
20 | Sonia Dotson | 6 | 10154764774916336_10154765495811336 | Who cares about Clinton,? This not about her, it is about We the People of the United States. We of every kind are concerned over our joint survival both globally independent and financial strong both domestically and abroad. We are not so foolish and self focused to only consider each others skins but consider our citizenship and unity by it. It is not about her. It is about We the People.
21 | Richard Biazus | 12 | 10154764774916336_10154765499026336 | This is what a President is supposed to sound like, "a hand up not a hand out" Obama is pushing racial segregation and shackling the lower class with a new slavery called Government Assistance. People have become so blind they thank him instead of seeing the long term affects of the ulterior motives. It is time to break free and unite as Americans.
22 | Samuel Nimmo | 2 | 10154764774916336_1332251640132766 | This is how bad the Democrat party is and how they feel about these voters. They choose to throw concerts instead of engaging in conversation. They think you are too dumb to understand the policies but easy enough to get by giving free Jay Z tickets too. Lmao Democrats, tossing cheese to the rats.
23 | Joann Williber | 5 | 10154764774916336_950013281810015 | Don't forget Hilary's long time friend--The leader of the KKK----Robert Byrd--- Hilary is only for African Americans when she needs VOTES-She had 30 years to help --what makes you think she will help the people now?
24 | Rick Slatter | 5 | 10154764774916336_1772535342995399 | If Nixon had not brought in the Southern Strategy then maybe African American maybe inclined to vote Republican. Every time Trump mentions them he mentions ghettos, he does realise there are Middle and Upper class African American' as well right?
25 | Melly Mel Woodruff | 4 | 10154764774916336_10154765570356336 | Everyone is worried about there vote cause it counts so much .. I'm sorry but in 30 plus years killary hasn't done one thing for black or white ... the fact is unless you have big money you don't even hit the radar... in all out facts the government and Congress and the POTUS and Hillary are just WHAT WE DON'T NEED....

The estranged husband of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin was spotted riding a horse at the $25,000-per-stay center as part of "equine therapy."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Tyler Hooker | 4362 | 10154764986846336_10154765281801336 | Not sure the best therapy for him involves mounting and riding
2 | Zach Kerman | 1792 | 10154764986846336_10154765280786336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
3 | Marlan Gero | 1284 | 10154764986846336_10154765284506336 | I'm sick and tired of those who say Hillary has no great accomplishments. I would say staying out of prison for the crimes  she committed in the last 4 decades is a great accomplishment.  People I am being sarcastic.
4 | Thomas Haneisen | 816 | 10154764986846336_10154765300811336 | $25k to ride a horse to heal him from sexting kids? Pretty sure a bag of rubber bands is less than a dollar and will still cure him of his "ailment ".
5 | Heather Ren√©e Bowersox | 216 | 10154764986846336_10154765293236336 | He probably shouldn't be riding anything. His therapy should include not riding versus riding. And possibly a shock collar for every time he thinks of having sex. Just a thought. Now back to the real world.
6 | Greg Iceberg Bergstresser | 177 | 10154764986846336_10154765290481336 | Dude should be in general population prison!! He's a predator of children just like Clinton!! He's the worst type of person!! And those that support him and in his circle need to be investigated!!
7 | Leif Sikl√≥ssy | 162 | 10154764986846336_10154765282046336 | The underage sext scandal of disgraced Democrat Anthony Weiner is slowing down the momentum of the Clinton campaign by reminding voters of the way that Hillary Clinton tried to hide the shady crimes she was preparing and committing while storing her email correspondence on a server in the basement of her primary residence. #NeverClinton

9 | Hrnandz Fina | 49 | 10154764986846336_10154765314431336 | I hope he has 24/7 bodyguards.... now that he and his Saudi spy wife have flipped on Crooked Hillary, no telling what type of 'accident' he may have.
10 | Dan Morales | 38 | 10154764986846336_10154765318801336 | 25k per day, I wonder who is paying for that/ The DNC maybe? To keep him stashed away from cops and reporters until after the election? Let's see how long his "therapy" lasts past next Tuesday.
11 | Geisha Serafin | 32 | 10154764986846336_574052722779508 | It's okay for Michelle Obama to surround herself and daughters with people like Miley Cyrus, Beyonc√©, JZ, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry, Arianna Grande, Lena Dunham.  Wow, I'm so glad that I'm a deplorable and don't have to live with out of touch people who only live in their bubbles and not with real friends or people.  If you notice these star studded people only have one thing in mind üí©CRAP.

13 | Donny Martel | 19 | 10154764986846336_574047016113412 | Obama and Hillary have made a complete mockery of the American justice system and there is no possible way to fix it until they are both indicted for treason. This guy should be under police protection until all the crooks and abusers are arrested and prosecuted. What`s the next headline going to read, Weiner falls off horse and breaks neck! Wtf.
14 | John Fitch | 22 | 10154764986846336_1664142790550252 | His therapy should consist of getting kicked in the junk repeatedly by the horse....might not cure him, but would be fun as hell to watch.
15 | Vera Thompson | 28 | 10154764986846336_1236639983073749 | So sexting underage minors as a political leader lands you in a $25K equine therapy rehab... While the common Joe would be labeled a sex offender for the rest of his/her life and probably a stint in jail. Makes sense. These people are all criminals. Send them all to prison!! Monsters!
16 | Mike Shockley | 13 | 10154764986846336_1664152570549274 | ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,‚Äù the NYPD Chief said. ‚ÄúThere is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that. People are going to prison.‚ÄùThese are the reported words of an NYPD Police Chief. In the department, a Chief is only one rank beneath the Commissioner.The NYPD Special Victims Unit was tasked with researching former Congressman Anthony Weiner‚Äôs laptop. It is likely that they had not idea that the sexting addict‚Äôs wife, Huma Abedin, had somehow saved emails that would expose Hillary Clinton‚Äôs career.How bad is it? Reportedly, the information is bad enough ‚Äúto put Hillary and her crew away for life.‚Äù The words were spoken to True Pundit.After finding more than 500,000 emails related to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs time as Secretary of State, the NYPD informed the FBI. FBI Director James Comey was ‚Äúforced‚Äù to open an investigation.What would have happened if Comey had chosen not to act?The NYPD said, ‚ÄúWe have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that. People are going to prison.‚ÄùFBI Sources say that Abedin and Weiner are cooperating with them, and the two are shopping for separate immunity deals.One official said, ‚ÄúIf they do not cooperate they are going to see long sentences.‚ÄùThe emails may implicate members of Congress and one member of the Senate, as well.Authorities are subpoenaing the cell phone and travel records of Abedin and Weiner, especially those records that pertain to the Bahamas.Why are the Bahamas important? Convicted sex slave pedophile Jeffrey Epstein ran a party island there, where he allegedly pimps out underage boys and girls to international dignitaries.NYPD and FBI sources believe that Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein‚Äôs guest at least six times, probably more. Bill Clinton has been reported, by multiple sources, to have traveled there more than 20 times.Below are a the bullet-form highlights of the case.Evidence links to:Money launderingChild exploitationSex crimes with minors (children)PerjuryPay to play through Clinton FoundationObstruction of justiceOther felony crimesThe investigation includes:Abedin forwarded classified and top secret State Department emails to Weiner‚Äôs emailAbedin stored emails, containing government secrets, in a special folder shared with Weiner warehousing over 500,000 archived State Department emails.Weiner had access to these classified and top secret documents without proper security clearance to view the recordsAbedin also used a personal yahoo address and her Clintonemail.com address to send/receive/store classified and top secret documentsA private consultant managed Weiner‚Äôs site for the last six years, including three years when Clinton was secretary of state, and therefore, had full access to all emails as the domain‚Äôs listed registrant and administrator via Whois email contacts.This case is bad and it appears to be getting worse as we go along.

20 | Josh Bister | 9 | 10154764986846336_764161417065868 | So many scandals connected with the Clintons it's pathetic. If she gets elected she will cover them up permanently. Then the crookedness continues for most likely eight long years. I don't think this country can survive it.
21 | Sergey Malovatov | 30 | 10154764986846336_702654976556365 | Five Questions to Hillary ClintonHillary Clinton goes to a gifted-student primary school in New York to talk about the world. After her talk she offers to answer questions from the kids.One little boy puts up his hand. Hillary asks him what his name is."Kenny," he says."And what is your question, Kenny?" she asks."I have three questions," he says. "First -- what happened in Benghazi? "Second -- why would you run for president if you are not capable of handling two e-mail accounts? "Third -- what happened to that six billion dollars that went missing while you were Secretary of State?‚ÄùJust then the bell rings for recess.Hillary tells the students that they will continue after recess. When they resume Hillary says,"Okay, where were we? Oh, that's right, question time. Who has a question?‚ÄùA different boy -- little Johnny -- puts his hand up.Hillary points to him and asks him what his name is."Johnny," he says."What is your question, Johnny?" she asks."I have five questions," he says. "First -- what happened in Benghazi? "Second -- why would you run for president if you are not capable of handling two e-mail accounts? "Third -- what happened to that six billion dollars that went missing while you were Secretary of State? "Fourth -- why did the recess bell go off 21 minutes early? "And, fifth -- where's Kenny?‚Äù
22 | Judith Burrill | 11 | 10154764986846336_10154765288776336 | OFF TOPIC - why does Kennedy even have a job ? here's she is reading the electoral map, she spews nothing but anti GOP crap on her show, then she does a schizophrenic turn about and creates a new persona excited about Trump ? Phony.

25 | Taz Ganiyu | 0 | 10154764986846336_1604355059867810 | If only one just a measly one work email of Hillary Clinton's gets discovered inside Anthony Weiner's laptop, their marked classified, or a Clinton Foundation/ State Dept cozy partnership, the Trump train will all be thanking him. Sometimes blessings come out of detestable situations/persons.

The woman suing Donald J. Trump has reportedly backed-off her accusations.

1 | Giulio Braga | 7233 | 10154765173996336_10154765176591336 | If they‚Äôve paid people to start violence at rallies, then I‚Äôm sure they probably are paying women to say they were harassed by Trump. There is no longer trust, they even ruined Bernies chances, they will do anything to win.
2 | Louis Colosi | 4298 | 10154765173996336_10154765177926336 | I was asked how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste from a fellow deplorable Trumpian.
3 | Godswill Forche | 3046 | 10154765173996336_10154765175811336 | So let me get this straight, Hillary Clinton & her evil corrupt cronies condemned Donald Trump for making a vulgar statements eleven years ago in "private", and now they invite Jay Z who is lewd, vulgar & demeaning towards women & his wife Beyonc√© who is a racist Black Panther sympathizer to perform on her behalf? Hillary Clinton keeps taking hypocrisy & pandering to whole new disgusting levels.What's Hillary gonna do next? Pass out free hot sauce bottles at the door & have a comedian tell ya mama jokes intimations?
4 | SummerLauren Pendleton Crowder | 1708 | 10154765173996336_10154765181011336 | Im shocked, no really... i mean the fact she had zero evidence, witnesses, and had changed her story 10 times and wanted a huge amount of money did not send up any red flags at all...
5 | John Yori | 934 | 10154765173996336_10154765183076336 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your Facebook status if you support and will vote Donald J. Trump for President
6 | Harley Kesselman | 271 | 10154765173996336_10154765175461336 | I wonder how many articles we will see in the media about this....Very few I'm sure!
7 | Matthew Kranz | 150 | 10154765173996336_10154765185346336 | They're absolutely scared out of their minds and how could they not be? Between the flood from wikileaks and the avalanche from the F.B.I., it was only a matter of time before the Earth started shaking below their feet. Now we're seeing their true colors. They don't care about the will of the people. They only care about staying in power no matter what the cost. Did you see how fast Hillary's whole "When they go low, we go high" Campaign went out the window once things started going down hill? Obama as well. All they do is attempt to smear Trump and his supporters. I've got a bad feeling about what might happen if Clinton does win. I'm not entirely sure the people are going to accept it this time.
8 | Jarrod Hamlin | 206 | 10154765173996336_10154765176216336 | What if Hillary said "I don't believe black people have the right to vote or hold any political office"?She would be destroyed. Mocked and persecuted. No one would vote her except maybe some back woods rednecks. She wouldn't even make it past the first round. Right? So why is it that she can support the killing of babies and has come this far? Think about it. Our conscious is so seared. We have greyed the area of right and wrong. Hillary is a part of the greatest genocide this world has ever seen. And so are her supporters. Over 55,000,000 babies have been aborted and murdered in America over the last 20 years. Ripped from their mothers wombs with a vacuum. Did you know if you are charged with even touching a sea turtle or bald eagle egg you can be fined tens of thousands of dollars and up to 20 years in prison. But you kill a human child and the government will help pay for it?!?!? That is so screwed up. And one day you'll be a grandparent and your grandkids will read about this. Just like you read about MLK and the marches against segregation. And they'll ask, "what did you do grandpa/ma when all those babies were being killed?"  Will you answer "nothing. I didn't want to rock the boat". Or "I voted for Hillary because it was time for a woman". Or will you say "I stood up and voted for the person who wants to save human life. I marched. I faced persecution for my stance. But I did everything I could to fight for those babies."If there is EVER a time to be a one issue voter, THIS IS IT!!!!!I want to be able to look back and say I tried. From the moment of conception both science and scripture say that's a person. And they deserve to be fought for. "You formed my inmost being; You knit me in my mother's womb. I praise you, so wonderfully you made me; Wonderful are your works! My very self you knew; My bones were not hidden from you, When I was being made in secret, Fashioned as in the depths of the earth. Your eyes foresaw my actions; In your book all are written down; My days were shaped, before one came to be."Psalms 139:13-16
9 | Robert Laird | 97 | 10154765173996336_10154765195296336 | *Warning - Political Post Incoming*I do not care if Donald Trump called a woman fat. I do not care if he tried to sleep with a woman or if he likes "beautiful" women. I don't care if he said things in reference to women in private that offended someone. I honestly don't care about any of this slander!I DO CARE that he sent a plane to pick up 200 Marines who were stranded after desert storm. I care that he supports our police officers and first responders. I care that he supports guns and the 2nd ammendment. I care that he stands behind our military. I care that he supports the death penalty and is AGAINST abortion. I care that he supports enforcing immigration laws. I care that he wants to destroy radical Islamic groups. I care that he supports COAL. I care that he wants to do away with common core and aid in our repair of the education system. I care that he wants to abolish Obama Care. I care that he wants to reduce taxes and build the middle class back. I care that wants to bring jobs back to our country. I care that he wants to fix our trade agreements and do away with NAFTA and TPP. These are the things I care about in this election!Him talking sexually about women does not bother me. Were they mean words? Yes. Were they words spoken in PRIVATE? Yes. Have you ever talked to your friends about the opposite sex in private and said things? I'm positive all of you have. News Flash!! Women have been sexualized for centuries!! In today's society we even have Jay-Z, Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne and every single other rapper helping to establish that platform, but people are ok with music blasted all over the radio degrading women. Ever heard of Victoria Secret? Or their fashion show? Ever heard of Hooters? Did you know there are strip clubs all over the United States? We live in a society where sex is used for sales, viewers, and attention. People are ok with all of this and until all of these things are different, women will continually be viewed this way. I don't agree with all of it, but I'm continually forced to see it and accept it.Your precious Obama couldn't change the way women are viewed or referred to and Hillary can't either. I feel sorry for the women Donald has belittled and said terrible things about. But I'm still much more offended by what Hillary Clinton has DONE over what Donald Trump has SAID... PERIOD!!!! So Trump doesn't do well at the debates, maybe he even sounds childish. But he is speaking the truth! Just because he's not a polished politician like Hillary or Obama doesn't mean he's unqualified to be president. He cares for this country, not growing the size of his pockets. That man has so much money he could never spend it all. He gets NOTHING out of being president! I'm standing for the man accused of saying mean words. I'm standing with Trump!I'll never back a woman who is under three different scandal investigations, possible murder at Benghazi, and the secretive email scandal which has been nothing but lies from the beginning. Or how about the child rapist she defended or the women she has abused thru her husband? The watergate scandal or the 4 billion dollars she simply lost? What about all the death of individuals surrounding Clinton investigations? What about all the money the Clinton Foundation has received and continues to receive from country's that don't have Americas interest at heart and stand for things I dont agree with, like killing gays and women. The SCANDALS and LIES are HUGE on her RECORD and then she flip flops on every other opinion based on who she is talking too. Heck, her accent even changes based on where she is talking at. Her lies are so bad now she has to tell lies to cover up the lies shes already told. Let us also NOT forget what Bill Clinton stands for and who he is. His cheating, affairs and womanizing are all completely noted as well! I refuse to stand with this or support any of it!Copy & paste & pass it on! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpForPresident
10 | Kari Lynn | 104 | 10154765173996336_10154765195286336 | ANOTHER BOGUS ACCUSATION: Listen: you say you go to a party and get raped-----then, you go to another party at the same home where you were raped before?????????? No, no woman could be THAT stupid! Jane Doe is another money grabber who will do and say anything even at the expense of destroying the only thing she truly owns--that being her integrity.
11 | Daniel Martin | 64 | 10154765173996336_10154765181691336 | She never existed. They demanded she come to court, and that's when it got dropped. It's just crooked Hillary and the vile, nasty liberals doing what they do best... going low.
12 | Gene Cole | 46 | 10154765173996336_10154765188731336 | If there had ever been any merit to this case, Hillary would have already hired Gloria Allred to take this girl in to protective custody to see to it that she testified. Clearly, that was not the case.
13 | Steve Phillippy | 60 | 10154765173996336_10154765188401336 | They got what they wanted anyway. Doofs will still run around saying he is a rapist, just like they say he makes fun of handicapped, that he is a racist and hates women. All bogus. It doesn't matter the sheeple still will say and think it like the mindless, useful idiots they are.
14 | Stephanie Walters | 41 | 10154765173996336_1007535152706417 | This accuser's attorney is none other than Lisa Bloom who's mother just happens to be Gloria Allred! This woman is a staunch supporter of Hillary and represents the former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos,who as its been reported accepted 500k from Gloria Allred to accuse Trump of sexual harrassment. I guess the poison apple doesn't fall too far from the tree!
15 | Marcella Eric Kudaka | 44 | 10154765173996336_920208838115837 | I'm sick and tired of those who say Hillary has no great accomplishments. I would say staying out of prison for the crimes  she committed in the last 4 decades is a great accomplishment.
16 | Shellie Grisham | 24 | 10154765173996336_707360346096206 | Donald Trump was never accused of any of these things before he decided to run for president. The left always paints the opposition in the same light. He's a rapist, a bigot, a horrible person blah blah blah. The same song and dance...
17 | Cameron Eberhart | 43 | 10154765173996336_10154765178591336 | That's because she knew she would get beat down by the media when the TRUTH was set free !!  Another Clinton scandal I can assure you went bad !!
18 | Dennis Watson | 30 | 10154765173996336_10154765189476336 | I need to ask all y'all a question please give me replies what is wrong with us becoming friends with Russia don't you think would Russia be in our allies we will be unstoppable no other country would dare mess with us including China they won't be able to stop us everything we got here in America is made by China we don't charge them taxes bringing all their stuff in but they charge us to bring our stuff over there can you tell me what is wrong with this picture and why shouldn't we be friends with Russia
19 | Belinda Leah | 21 | 10154765173996336_705438399625423 | How do we threaten a "Jane Doe"?And why if this absolutely horrifying crime occurred and ruined a life would said person forget it for 30 years and then back out right before she received justice? Lies..all to destroy a man for cash.Men are jailed everyday for false accusations of rape..this should be criminal just as a man who would do something such as this to a woman is criminal.
20 | Luba Pankiw Lallouz | 16 | 10154765173996336_1614090398894631 | Personally I think Hillary should be the one who should be sued for libel and all the lies she has been spreading about D.T. "without proof" during this campaign for the last year and a half!   Makes me wonder how much Hillary paid these women who accused D.T. of these sexual improprieties?  Perhaps one of them hopefully will admit it!
21 | JudyLea Irwin | 15 | 10154765173996336_1844175112487027 | This accuser's attorney Lisa Bloom is the daughter of Gloria Allred who reportedly paid an "accuser" $500,000 to falsely accuse Trump of improprieties.  Trump has denied all these accusations, and has said he will sue these women for the false accusations.  There is no evidence against him.However, there is plenty of written evidence against Clinton for his trips on the Epstein Lolita Express plane to his island site for under-aged sex with girls and boys.  Now, rumors are saying that Hillary went there, too, but I have only seen the log of the plane's trips showing Bill Clinton as a passenger.  The rumors are saying that Hillary went, and that wiki-leaks will show evidence, but I have not seen that yet, so I won't assign that crime to her. There are plenty of other crimes documented against her ... she is definitely unfit to lead this country. :-(
22 | Kathy Gronau | 22 | 10154765173996336_1792824130960635 | After hearing about Gloria Allred and her shenanigans, I now wonder about all the accusations against Bill Cosby. This is just absolutely crazy. People being paid to say stuff about others for a payday and a payout. It's sickening.
23 | Glenna Nance Miller | 12 | 10154765173996336_1007557692704163 | Of course she dropped the case because it simply isn't true!  If it were true she would have prosecuted years ago instead of dropping it then. She no doubt was paid by the opposition to reopen it at this time, but can't go thru with it because it never happened.
24 | Phillip Schmiedeskamp | 15 | 10154765173996336_1007539396039326 | All of these accusations are attempts by Hillary and the DNC to try to bring Trump's poll numbers down. One by one they are proving to be unfounded. The corruption within the DNC is unbelievable.
25 | Sean C. Blevins | 13 | 10154765173996336_1007544366038829 | I saw a statement one time that said: "I'm more offended by the things Hillary does than the things Trump says." It really spoke to me because Hillary Clinton is committing horrible acts against her country: Benghazi, the email scandal, paying women to lie about Trump. Donald, all he's done is say a few harsh things to some people. Is that really the worst thing in the world for a politician to do, is say "mean" things? Besides, Donald Trump was a celebrity before running for President, so he's very well known already, and he's NEVER been accused of being racist or raping anyone until he ran against the Democrats. They'll say quite literally anything to derail their competition.
