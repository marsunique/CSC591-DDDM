In its settlement, T-Mobile will pay a $7.5 million penalty while $35.5 million will go to customers in the form of discounts or data upgrades.

10 | Brian Carter | 10154001876100950_10154001904240950 | POINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary? She has left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her or knew too much!#CROOKEDHILLARY defends Planned Parenthood, and allows them to kill millions upon millions of babies to die every year, but has a grandbaby of her own. WHY IS ABORTION NOT MURDER, BUT IT IS A HOMOCIDE WHEN A PREGNANT WOMAN IS SHOTAND KILLED. #HILLARYtheBABYkiller#TRUMP/PENCE 2016 IF YOU WANT TO LIVE FREE IN AMERICA WITHOUT THE FEAR OF BEING KILLED BY HILLARY CLINTON OR HER GOONS.
11 | Brian Carter | 10154001876100950_10154001924325950 | Hillary Spokesman Showed Reporter Phone, What Happens Next PROVES ItPosted by Matthew Bernstein | Oct 21, 2016 | Liberal CorruptionThe numerous amounts of WikiLeaks releases have shown that the media has been on Hillary Clintons side the entire time! They have shown that New York Times reporters are asking what they can do to help Hillary and her failing campaign.Every mainstream media source, outside of Fox News, has had a clear form of bias against the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump. Whether it is their refusal to air any of the WikiLeaks releases or they consistently air comments made by Trump over ten years ago, they have shown that they are for Clinton.There is something else to add to the mix. There is video evidence that shows that NBC reporter Andrea Mitchell appeared to receive a question to ask from Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill. Not only did she receive the question, but also she even ASKED it!This came after the Wednesday night debate when Clinton was speaking with reporters for a little while. What occurs is that Clinton is speaking to the crowd and Merrill can be seen behind her typing on a phone. After he is done typing he then shows the phone to Mitchell, who does a quick nod in approval.Now nothing is actually said between the two and it’s impossible to tell what is on the phone, but the fact that the media has been coordinating with the Clinton campaign in the past shows that this is more than likely. Not to mention that she looks at the phone and nods before asking the question.Plus, the question that was asked wasn’t hard hitting at all. “How did you feel when he [Trump] said, you know, ‘Nasty woman, nasty woman,’ and ‘You’re a puppet,’ and… the issue of Vladimir Putin?” What kind of a question is that? Not to mention that it was Clinton who originally called Trump a puppet and he just sent the comment right back.But these are the types of questions that the media has been used to asking Clinton. There is nothing about her policy, nothing about the WikiLeaks releases, and absolutely nothing substantial! The question was how she felt because of a comment that Trump made.Naturally Clinton took the opportunity to attack Trump for not accepting that Russia is tied to the efforts of WikiLeaks. But again this type of question is exactly what Clinton has been getting all campaign. They’re all about how she feels and anything related to thatHow is that relative to anything that the voters have to go through? There are more important issues that need to be discussed, like the terrorist threat, Clinton’s continued assault on Russia, and jobs! Yet they are more focused on asking how she felt after some comments?And now this shows that members of the media might be receiving questions to ask Clinton from members of her staff? But there is also something else that should be noted. After Merrill appeared to give the question to Mitchell, he seemed to text something else to someone because he gave a “check your phone” gesture to someone else.It could possibly be another question that a reporter is going to ask! We don’t know whom he was sending the text to, but considering that he showed Mitchell a question that he wanted her to ask, nothing is out of the question.Naturally Mitchell denied everything about it. “I was on live and couldn’t see in the crush of the gaggle – but no way would anyone try to give me a question. That would never happen.” If that is the case, then you wouldn’t mind telling us what was on that phone.After all if it was something non important then you would have no trouble saying exactly what was on it. And considering the fact that the media has been in the pocket of the Clinton campaign for a long time, you would do whatever you could to make sure that you didn’t get caught in this. But all you give is that denial?That just raises more questions. But it also shows something else. The media will say and do anything to deny their involvement with the Clinton campaign. This evidence shows that clearly Mitchell liked what was on Merrill’s phone! Otherwise she wouldn’t have nodded in agreement.Plus if the media really wasn’t biased, why are they only giving the softball questions to Clinton and not to Trump? They never ask how he feels after Clinton attacks him. No they only ask him questions that they should be asking the both of them!But this isn’t the first time that the media has been completely against Trump. They have been helping Clinton since the start! They have shown that they have been helping Clinton with some of her scandals and everything that is involved with it. This includes some of the news media that is cutting feeds when people bring up the WikiLeaks scandal.They actually cut the feed and try to play it off like it was an accident. That couldn’t be any less of the truth because it happened seconds after the Congressman brought up the WikiLeaks releases.Not only that but as stated before, the New York Times has been controlled by the Clinton campaign as well. They are actively doing what they can to make sure that nothing bad about Clinton gets posted.Share this article to show that Clinton’s campaign staff might be telling the news media exactly what questions to ask. This just happened with Andrea Mitchell. The evidence shows that she was shown something on one of her staffers phones and then she asked a softball sized question.This is just another reason that we need to vote for Trump.

They aren’t going to ask anything substantial about the electionhttps://youtu.be/FqYQ2OtggPw

The officer is seen on the video apparently kicking the man in the head as he lies on the ground — with his hands cuffed behind his back.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Rob Ward | 10154001776165950_10154001799965950 | ... The Police haven't just recently become violent. They've always been violent. But now we all have cameras in our hand. We sometimes criticize our addiction to technology, but it is our phones that will inevitably force the cops to change.
2 | Ben Moreland | 10154001776165950_10154001789605950 | The media has lost all interest in being fair and balanced. Instead of being a vessel for the propagation of news, it has transformed into an arm and leg of the Democrat Party.
3 | Joseph Boutote | 10154001776165950_10154001843035950 | I say, give all the cops (including obumers and clintons) a month off. All you brave little people will then have to protect yourselfs. See how long you last.
4 | Jack Griffin | 10154001776165950_10154001851505950 | Oh we are back to the bad cop stories.. You run out of attack material on Trump?   Exactly who will be police when nobody will take this thankless job?  I'd have more sympathy if these were innocent people instead of crooks that would cut your throat for 10 cents
5 | Mike Wood | 10154001776165950_10154001804305950 | Was listening to your commentary. CBS is complaining that Mr. Trump is acting irresponsibly by calling you out. We are not being mislead by Trump. Ms. Brazille, one of your own (sic) journalist is passing questions. You must believe that we are too stupid to see the way you try to "steer" the public in a certain direction. Trump is not irresponsible, he's calling you out for what you are. You are not used to people calling you liars and deceivers. This is what you are. The fourth estate is on life support. Edward R Morrow and Ernie Pyle are spinning in their graves. Do you even remember unbiased reporting? How about courage and integrity? These words have to have some meaning? Check the dictionary, it's been a while since you've practiced both.
6 | Jamey Carnes | 10154001776165950_10154001843630950 | So what! He is a freaking criminal piece of garbage! If you stop treating this filth like they have rights and treat them like the vermin they are, you will cut criminal activity in half!
7 | Rose Kessinger-Fornash | 10154001776165950_10154001812010950 | Would someone please find the man that was arrested and let him know that this video exists. This arrested man should know there are good people in this world , even strangers that care enough to take time to report this type of abuse.
8 | William H Lanteigne | 10154001776165950_10154001925265950 | The cure is simple enough: if the judge finds out that excessive use of force was used in an arrest, the charges should be dismissed "with prejudice" (that's legalese for "[s]he can't be charged again"). And if that leads to lawsuits against police, so be it, the police unions can pay the legal bills. OR, police can stop usurping the courts' authority by meting out "street punishment."
9 | Susie Lott | 10154001776165950_10154001862880950 | Penalties should be so much harsher when law enforcement commits a crime. This rotten officer put the lives and reputation of other good officers in danger.
10 | Steve Matos | 10154001776165950_10154001870185950 | I am 100% supported of police , but some should not be Cops " Time to find a different job , I would not and could not handle being a Officer of the Law " cause many make the job so tough and stressful when we don't know what compliance with the law means , Instead of following orders , it's No I don't to ! You are Harassing Me ! €<<>~>You Pig !! No respect for the Law , If only people would at civil these things would not happen or less of this would happen ..
11 | Judy Peterson Sheldon | 10154001776165950_10154001898780950 | This kind of cruelty needs to stop. No provoking no movements.. I am just going to kick your head anyway because....I want to! So totally cruel and unnecessary!
12 | Christian Arvisais | 10154001776165950_10154001794700950 | For those who still think Hillary did not lie to America and the FBI and jeopardize our security  here is proof in a video Hillary created .http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/21/clinton-lectured-state-dept-staff-on-cybersecurity-in-2010-video.html#http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/09/02/clinton-told-fbi-she-had-no-training-how-handle-classified-documents/89651862/
13 | Arnie Jenks | 10154001776165950_10154001802680950 | That must be why people run from the law, they don't want to get beat up after being handcuffed.
14 | Timothy Ellison | 10154001776165950_10154001812130950 | Well take his badge away and give him a major mental evaluation. Don't these cops understand this is like the Millennium where there's cameras everywhere and everybody carries a camera. My God we can't even hardly leave your house without being on camera this day in age. And the law enforcement officers are that stupid to do stupid acts like that to begin with let alone knowing that they're probably being caught on camera.
15 | Kiki Hemphill | 10154001776165950_10154001795425950 | Anyone who justifies the actions of this officer is clearly an irrational human being.
16 | Augustine Taylor | 10154001776165950_10154001787525950 | Do the same to the cop and see if he thinks his civil rights are being violated
17 | Terry Ridley | 10154001776165950_10154001794745950 | Good for the the officer, more than likely the dude was cussing the officer. Thugs Criminals Kill
18 | Maria Resendes | 10154001776165950_10154001824420950 | It's just unbelievable the guy is down why kick him? This cop is a poor excuse for a human being
19 | James Thomas | 10154001776165950_10154001980030950 | "Joseph Boutote I say, give all the cops (including obumers and clintons) a month off. All you brave little people will then have to protect yourselfs. See how long you last." Well Joseph, I'm locked and loaded with that said about the criminals. with all due respect to the good police officers out there, I support them but not the bad ones. I sincerely hope, the good ones feel the same way
20 | Priscilla Sue Thomason | 10154001776165950_10154001800230950 | There is no excuse for these officers, to have kicked this man, while he was on the ground and handcuffed.
21 | Malachi Wright | 10154001776165950_10154001816315950 | Just here to see the folks who are gonna find a excuse for the police.
22 | Mark Anthony Williams | 10154001776165950_10154001803460950 | We need to do something about these police brutalities & act swiftly
23 | Adrian LaHaie | 10154001776165950_10154001860230950 | I reserve my anger at the Feds until I know what this person did.
24 | Carolyn Leonard | 10154001776165950_10154001863590950 | This is why some people do not trust cops. This is criminal. Cops are not above the law themselves.
25 | Christopher Merryman | 10154001776165950_10154001997725950 | who cares,if he is a Trump supporter,he deserves to get kicked,lol

Whenever Lauren Vinje was feeling low while she waited for her 3-pound, 14-ounce baby girl to grow in the NICU, she pulled out this picture. Looking at that great big smile on her little girl's face, she realized: "Life is so precious.”

4 | Shanti Keyz | 10154001710895950_10154001763320950 | You people and the Hilary bs. Any mother that wants her child can have her child. Wtf. You are all extremest crazies. So how many welfare families are you 'happy' to support? How many crack babies are you happy to adopt? Get off your high horse.
5 | Keith Kent | 10154001710895950_10154001784610950 | You liberals don't believe these premie babies ate anything but just globs of cells that can be ripped out of a woman's body, you hypocrites
6 | Edward Palacio | 10154001710895950_10154001755630950 | Holy shit I can't wait till this election is over so all you deplorables can crawl back into your holes.
7 | Henry Commons | 10154001710895950_10154001764660950 | Two bad people think that children in the mother's womb are not human beings and deserving their rights as human beings.In the U.S., people like Hillary Clinton, who is running for POTUS, do not believe the child in the mother's womb is a human being and does not have a U.S. Constitutional right or a right to live in the Third Trimester or even 3 to fours days from due date. That is messed up.
8 | Briana Roper Burris | 10154001710895950_10154001806665950 | My twins were preemies as well! They were born 5 weeks early at 35 weeks 1 day. My daughter was 3 lbs 12 oz and my son was 4 lbs 11 oz. stayed in NICU for 17 days. The twins will be 3 months next week! I am a twin myself. I was born at 30 weeks weighing at 2 1/2 lbs.
9 | Brittney Hillerich | 10154001710895950_10154001844500950 | Awe cute little baby. Looks like he's saying, "I'm glad my mommy didn't abort me, like Mrs. Clinton says she could have done. Some babies my size and age are killed by their mommies and we don't have a choice or voice. Did you know that some babies that are just like me, have to have their little arms and legs ripped off one at a time. It really hurts them, they can feel it, but can do nothing. Then a really sharp clamp grabs their little heads and squeezes it crushing their skull. If their brains are not squashed, they go on to live another few agonizing minutes until they draw their last breath. Thank you mommy for loving me and not murdering me before I had a chance at life." Seriously though, precious as ever that baby.
10 | Kathy Siegrist | 10154001710895950_10154001789020950 | WTF people! Politics? Really? Can't you say WOW a beautiful babyBut booboo lets spread political Bill shit instead! Y'all make me sick
11 | Stephanie Garza | 10154001710895950_10154001987780950 | My sweet step-daughter just gave birth to her first daughter. She was a preemie, also. I've seen the most precious smiles on her face when her Mommy spends time with her (which is almost all day, everyday). She is so very loved, by us all. She has a big brother who can't wait until Mommy brings her home. He actually gets mad when Mommy says that they won't let her bring her home until she gets stronger. As for Grandpa and I, we can't wait to hold her and kiss her and tell her how much we love her. She continues to get stronger every day. She's a treasure and a gift and we all fully intend to dote upon her. <3 Keep fighting, Maia!
12 | Dawn Larson | 10154001710895950_10154001745980950 | Babies that preemie would routinely be killed under Hillary's belief in unrestricted, unregulated abortion. This is a child, not a fetus .. yet pre-born babies that are older than this one should die for a political cause? Why?

They are committing voter fraud as I speak!! Where is the FBI?? Where is the media?? This is a disgrace. Why should Trump say he will accept the results of the election when we all know it IS RIGGED!!! I am so upset that nothing is being done!! If this was a Republican there would be hell to pay!!

3 | Sabrina Cook | 10154001647260950_10154001820075950 | This is highly offensive. The gorilla is breastfeeding in public. Doesn't she know that boobies are for sex and she is sexually assaulting her baby by breastfeeding her? I mean, why doesn't she wear a cover? The male gorillas are going to get all excited because her nipples are showing. How disgusting.
4 | Javier Tovar | 10154001647260950_10154001656915950 | That gorilla is taking care of that child just like harambe took care of that stupid little kid
5 | Ken McWilliams | 10154001647260950_10154001843825950 | I can't believe she's breastfeeding in public! Someone cover them monkey boobies up before Jesus sends another hurricane this way!
6 | Stephanie Schmidt | 10154001647260950_10154001923275950 | It's really sad that female people are considered gross and sex symbols so they can't breast feed around people because it's gross and not natural. Glad they haven't made it gross for animals to be able to breast feed their young. Yet there are some people out there that probably think it's offensive or hot 😒.
7 | Maria J. Gomez | 10154001647260950_10154001901860950 | It's amazing without the intelligence that us humans have she knows to care for that child, sucks some women can't even come close to that.
8 | Zabi Habash | 10154001647260950_10154001719455950 | Simply Beautiful, now only if they were released back into the wild. A cage is a cage no matter how glamorous it might be.
9 | Cathy Galvin | 10154001647260950_10154002004125950 | The beautiful tenderness that this mommy is showing this incredibly tiny little gift is the most beautiful thing. The tenderness of a mother. You can tell she's a wonderful mother. ❤️
10 | Brian Wilga | 10154001647260950_10154001651270950 | Harambe would have loved to have a child
11 | Jimmy Don | 10154001647260950_10154001726985950 | She really should cover her breast while feeding ;)
12 | Summer MacPherson | 10154001647260950_10154001812325950 | And she gets to breast feed in public without humiliation!!! Animals are better!
13 | Joanne Voss | 10154001647260950_10154001667630950 | I absolutely love animals especially gorillas. Looks like she's smiling 👍😍
14 | Nicholas McClellan | 10154001647260950_10154001858835950 | I can now say that I have seen gorillas taking better care of their children than some of the human mothers i have been around
15 | Rose Singer | 10154001647260950_10154001720885950 | If only humans had a bit of animal in them...
16 | LaShunda Birks | 10154001647260950_10154001704035950 | Best mom ever...I hope the dad stays in their lives as well!👍🏾
17 | Heidi Kelley | 10154001647260950_10154001732210950 | Something to warm your heart and make you smile! This actual made me tear up!! Tom Maggie Heather
18 | Robert Roy Jr | 10154001647260950_10154001722330950 | Harambe could have saved the species, but...well, he had too many secrets
19 | John Reed | 10154001647260950_10154001710170950 | Too bad uncle Harambe was murdered by Hillary - Steve Elliott James Gannon
20 | D Allen Clark | 10154001647260950_10154001815100950 | Hey? No breastfeeding in public!!! Hahaha! Wish her and baby long time of health and happiness!!!
21 | Susan Rahill Simon | 10154001647260950_10154001754155950 | It really does look like they're smiling at each other.
22 | Kristy Hoa | 10154001647260950_10154001962410950 | Awww... just look at the way the mother is holding her baby and looking at her. Its so human like!
23 | Jayne Kaulius Love | 10154001647260950_10154001797550950 | I love it when mom kisses her baby's hand...nothing like a mother's love
24 | Jack A. Travis | 10154001647260950_10154001718425950 | A tiny ray of hope for the species???? They live captive in a zoo....how is that a ray of hope????
25 | Kimberly Konkel | 10154001647260950_10154001773990950 | Hopefully no idiots put their child over the side of the fence and the fall in and this one gets shot too. 😠

Clinton "created this mess," top aide said in email exchange.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mike Left | 10154001603005950_10154001626240950 | Ya know it is kind of funny that I have not come in contact with even one Hillary supporter any where I go. Either there aren't any, or they are too ashamed to admit it.
2 | Catriona Birnie | 10154001603005950_10154001614295950 | Actually at the time she was not Secretary of State and also she didn't go, so I just love how you can read a little piece of a hacked email ( not even hers) and then become judge and jury
3 | Linda Critelli | 10154001603005950_10154001795650950 | Talking about Clinton Foundation, Pure evil, these poor people suffering and Hillary and Bill received billions and billions of dollars to help Haitians, yet Haiti didn't receive little to nothing to help them.  There is a special place in hell for baby killers and taking advatange of the weak and poor.https://www.facebook.com/AlexanderEmerickJones/videos/10154648862743459/?pnref=story
4 | Scott Partridge | 10154001603005950_10154001969715950 | I'm leaning to Trump now with all of her corrupt under the table deals along with her foundation everyone is stating they really do not pay taxes on and use it for a tax shelter.....Trump this year and we will see who is in the next election in 4 years. Sorry she burned Bernie and has to pay the price for that..!
5 | James Lester | 10154001603005950_10154001631830950 | Why isn't CBS talking about trump grabbing women. All this talk about emails why won't you report on the horrible things yrump has said?
6 | Teri Tipton Cottone | 10154001603005950_10154001838340950 | Where is the story about project Veritas? You made sure and covered protesters at Trump rallies pepper spraying 2 little Hispanic girls in the face.. Now that you know DNC operatives were paid to do this, where is the follow up story??? http://www.cbsnews.com/news/two-girls-allegedly-hit-with-pepper-spray-at-donald-trump-protest-in-california/
7 | Matthew Quiterio | 10154001603005950_10154001798050950 | Stop talking shit about Donald Trump! the reason why you all say bad things about him is because you are all scared he right about topics and scared he goes and office and finds out the real truth . You all scared that Donald Trump Shares with America information that the government was hiding from the citizens . Example: what hides at area 51 ,USA gold reserves and other confidential files that the public should know. Hillary Clinton has been in office for so long and nothing was ever done good, war affairs and maybe those deleted e-mails have to do with the fact she knows illegal trades or e-mails with important information that she never replied! We in Canada get to see all the Nonsense that goes in the U.S.A and we want Donald Trump ,You all in U.S.A , you not outside to see what we see from our yard!
8 | Gill Jingle | 10154001603005950_10154001659650950 | Democrats will retain the White House in 2016 because they are less awful than Republicans. This is so obvious that even ill informed and chronically obtuse “moderates” can see it.
9 | Gill Jingle | 10154001603005950_10154001660100950 | Hillary Clinton has made it crystal clear. Anyone who votes for her is voting for greatly expanded warfare in the Middle East and probably military confrontation with Russia elsewhere as well.
10 | Sam Gadalla | 10154001603005950_10154001939375950 | Smoke and mirrors, no proof of ANYTHING! The 25 year GOP Clinton witch hunt continues with millions of dollars spent and NOTHING to show for it!
11 | Gill Jingle | 10154001603005950_10154001662995950 | And, fundamentalist extremist Evangelicals pastors and leaders prayed with Trump, yet they did not know he had cheated for nearly 2 decades on his government, which “In God We Trust!” What a religion! Poor Uncle Sam!
12 | Gill Jingle | 10154001603005950_10154001665070950 | Foreign policy of the tribe of the U.S. is not a functional democracy, instead, it’s a repressive and corrupt oligarchy propped up by a blank check from Washington.
13 | Tom Lacerte | 10154001603005950_10154001707720950 | Secretary of State Clinton was keeping our national security secrets in her home. She deleted 30,000 government e-mails; we don't know what was in them. Hillary Clinton exposed our national security secrets to our enemies. People have gone to prison, for far less than what Hillary Clinton did.
14 | Gill Jingle | 10154001603005950_10154001659515950 | Both Hillary and Trump are awful presidential candidates! “Third party” politics at the national level in America today is, and long has been, a dead end.
15 | Stoney Williamson | 10154001603005950_10154001825575950 | Indeed there is something new in the air! The lies and criminal acts of Hillary and her associates is coming to the public compliments of Wikileaks. There is no need for the "mainstream media" anymore. You people attempt to silence the proof of Hillary and her cohorts, you divert any questions in reference to the revelations that has been revealed to the public! When confronted with what has been done at her direction or on her behalf she blames Russia. She does not deny the emails, she blames someone else for informing the world of her criminal activity.
16 | Benjamin Smith | 10154001603005950_10154001644120950 | And she's the best candidate huh? We are  the blind followers are we? Trump's arrogance is nothing compared to this! Lol
17 | Tom Lacerte | 10154001603005950_10154001647510950 | Hillary Clinton says one thing, to her billionaire buddies in private. Hillary Clinton says something completely different, to the American people in public. Hillary Clinton is a two-faced liar.
18 | Yvonne Clerebout | 10154001603005950_10154001609355950 | 'Podesta has warned that some emails may have been edited or altered by the hackers prior to release, though the Clinton campaign has yet to publicly identify an instance of that happening.' Bitches, If you knew it was doctored you would have said so by now and debunked the whole mess. Any innocent person would. You nasty woman.
19 | Gill Jingle | 10154001603005950_10154001666020950 | Theresa May is the UK PM, and if Hillary Clinton becomes the next US president, then the world will witness another GW Bush and Blair axis of evil to create more illegal wars around the world! Hillary has supported every single war the tribe of the U.S. got involved in any other countries since Vietnam. She is a continuation of G W Bush administration.
20 | Jason A Mojica | 10154001603005950_10154001604970950 | 2012 - Julian assange is a hero to the left when he leaked secrets of the BUSH wars!2016- But now that he released the truth about Hilary's crimes he's a spy controlled by Putin and trump
21 | Jack Bo | 10154001603005950_10154001710755950 | Why are you idiots not reporting on this? Wikileaks drops bombshell connecting Podesta with Putin. Podesta's daughter receives 75000 shares of energy company. 75,000 shares. Thats 75,000 shares. Wow 75,000 shares. And they don't report. Dirty pricks.
22 | Amy Smith | 10154001603005950_10154001854580950 | Did you miss the RIGGED set up for crooked, criminal Hillary At the debate? nothing she does is above board. Shameless! http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-21/hillary-debate-podium
23 | Ginger Taylor | 10154001603005950_10154001929810950 | It has been proven through under cover investigation Hitlary and the Democratic party used NAZI Brown Shirt Tactics against Trumps supporters at his rallies. Look at the Okeefe under cover videos.
24 | Gill Jingle | 10154001603005950_10154001660255950 | Hillary is a candidate of war, a consortium of war, and neo-con war lover belligerent bellicose female. In her second debate with Trump, she banished all doubts that she saw no reason to hold back in Syria. A vote for her is a vote not only for war, but for war on behalf of Al Qaeda. If she speaks about no-fly-zone in Syria, in fact it would be an act of war in which the U.S. would not only have to fire on Syrian forces, but on Russian and Iranian forces, too. Instead of peace, the result would be a vast escalation.
25 | Gill Jingle | 10154001603005950_10154001664530950 | Trump has one thing going for him that is sadly lacking in all the other candidates, all the party honchos, and all the flannel-mouth, stuffed-shirt fake politicians who are presently in office. What is that? He tells the truth, at least it sounds like the truth to a lot people.

1 | Fe Nicole | 10154001548720950_10154001568240950 | I'm confused about how this story has anything to do with politics....
2 | Mary V Leach Leyendecker | 10154001548720950_10154001664650950 | USA daily life is more than politics and may I remind that electoral votes will elect 💋
3 | Joseph O'Connell | 10154001548720950_10154001550615950 | CNN is in Hillary's pocket. CNN is owned by AT&T/Time Warner, which donated to Hillary's campaign. Corruption runs deep in the Clinton camp.

Meet some of the biggest social media influencers in the world, including Kim Kardashian West, on Sunday's 60 Minutes: http://cbsn.ws/2eqnK1i
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Maria Lynn | 10154001498955950_10154001551835950 | What is this country coming too.not a role model for any young girl..we have better...start looking..local towns all over the USA...start ...Wonderful role models..she is NOT who I would want my daughters or granddaughters to look up to...WHAT has she done????
2 | Je Colon | 10154001498955950_10154001515235950 | You rather put a woman who made films of fornicating than putting somebody like Candi Rice or other women who have contributed some kind of leadership? What is wrong with you liberals?
3 | Pablo Lora | 10154001498955950_10154001569780950 | Biggest influencer? man, you really got that wrong. I have never heard a speech from her motivating or influencing young woman to be and do better, she's just and exhibitionist, thats all.
4 | Amber Pham | 10154001498955950_10154001594550950 | "Some of the biggest social media influence." CBS how did you come up with this idea? Stop telling people what to think. Needless I say about Kim Kardashian
5 | John Monick | 10154001498955950_10154001644740950 | This crap amazes me,,people who get rich from exploitation of their ,ass,tits,looks,,and they have influence on world topics,, does anyone ever consider that what's wrong with the world ,,might just be the crap that has influence,,
6 | Sonia Baracoso | 10154001498955950_10154001612380950 | Interviewing this zero hollywood talent and skill moron is a complete waste of time. Is she gonna say her next nude photoshoot? Duhhh
7 | Paul McCormack | 10154001498955950_10154001571385950 | Wouldn't have with Mike Wallace still there... She's the manifestation  of society's misplaced ideals and blind allegiance to fame. When so many talented people labor in obscurity, wondering if they have a place and purpose in this world, 60 Minutes reaffirms that pretty and popular can land you a shot in prime time. "Social media influencer" isn't a job description. It's a cancer on society. Such people perpetuate unrealistic, unhealthy ideals of what constitutes success. 60 Minutes, I will not be watching.
8 | Machelle DeRon | 10154001498955950_10154001776135950 | Oh Noooooo 60 Minutes, seriously? Please don't try and help legitimize this fake@$$ person.....I definitely won't be tuning in.....I need a break for all the politics and fakery
9 | Tony Pepper | 10154001498955950_10154001511785950 | Shows how low we've sunk. Dumbed down by Democrats and teacher unions. Keep em stupid and dependant and they'll look at the shiney object.
10 | Linda Haider | 10154001498955950_10154001862255950 | Really you couldn't find real women that are positive influences on our young women. I have a granddaughter and nieces and this piece of trash isn't one I'd want them looking up to.
11 | Frank Komola | 10154001498955950_10154001964910950 | The last thing in the world I want to hear or see is a celebrity , especially on a program with the respect that 60 minutes has earned in the past. Very disappointed in the decision of 60 minutes to air this episode.
12 | Justin Kaplowitz | 10154001498955950_10154001843140950 | Don Hewett & Harry Reasoner wouldn't spin in their graves over this story.........They would break out of their coffins and their Zombie selves would seek revenge against the people who thought this was a good idea.
13 | Susan Roudie | 10154001498955950_10154001594870950 | What she's actually saying is she's a master manipulating marketer because she's sold nothing and made 100 million. Kinda like the pet rock.
14 | Kerrien Jari | 10154001498955950_10154001770335950 | Haha, he actually asked her, "what's your talent?". That's hilarious. I was about to say her and her family only good at 4 things, sweet talk, smiling face, boobs and butts.
15 | Michael Shippole | 10154001498955950_10154001567010950 | Actors couldn't act so they became dim witted reality stars, now the dim witted reality stars are social media stars. Lol just goes to show how bad entertainment is in the US today. No one is buying what theyre selling.
16 | Abdelhamid Bertal | 10154001498955950_10154001888215950 | I can't believe this one made it to 60 minutes. If Don Hewitt was still alive, she would not have been interviewed. Miss the old crew ! After this you should just kill the show guys !
17 | Carla Harris | 10154001498955950_10154001742395950 | ...or some kind of patheticness on our part that we obsess over her. I think we could all stand a little group therapy...lol
18 | Jimmy Don | 10154001498955950_10154001637690950 | So no influence. .. she's a rich b*tch that acts like it was clothes and not her acting like a slut on cam that got her and her shameful family famous.
19 | Kim Turner | 10154001498955950_10154001817585950 | This is the stupidest thing I've heard saying she has talent I'm not watching this   what's happening here interviewing her I thought 60 min had class
20 | John Porter | 10154001498955950_10154001593620950 | You REALLY didn't need to do this. This whore of Babylon should be ignored at least. At best, she should be sent to Afghanistan so we never need see her or that ass again.
21 | Nathan Bratsko | 10154001498955950_10154001756090950 | That fact idiots like her and Kanye and the rest of those airheads have influence, is exactly what is wrong with this world. They encourage people to be dumb.
22 | Michael Justin Banfield | 10154001498955950_10154001832585950 | I try to avoid her, but it's hard to escape this b.s. She's laughing all the way to the bank. It seems the more people hate her, the more money she keeps making.
23 | Ernest Spoon | 10154001498955950_10154001721980950 | 60 Minutes featuring Kim Kardashian is a symptom of the moral rot and lack of social responsibility of the domestic Main$tream Media.
24 | Mark Allgood | 10154001498955950_10154001509180950 | Billy Graham Issues STUNNING Statement on Donald Trump…No One Expected THIS!By R. M. - October 17, 201603896Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter   Trump is on target for what he promises to all Americans. The left isn’t that happy about the way he introduced the campaign, and told everyone that he dreams of big and safe America. Hillary’s supporters and the media came up with everything they could ever think of in order to get Trump out of the game. Not so fast, people! Your audio doesn’t mean a thing.Even Graham told everyone how he sees things, and that brought joy to everyone who cares about this country. Unlike people who hate Trump, he said a few good words that surprised us all. In a good way, of course. In your face, haters!Via Patriot JournalThey are epitome of hypocrisy. Most of the people decrying Trump give a pass to Bill Clinton, when as president he committed adultery with an intern. They continue to give a pass to Hillary, who protects her husband despite allegations of rape.And they ignore serious crimes Hillary committed when secretary of state.On the other hand, conservatives, who believe in such virtues as forgiveness, have been willing to look passed Trump’s remarks. We have enough common sense and decency to know everyone messes up, now and again, and needs our understanding and forgiveness.From Conservative Tribune:While the media couldn’t understand why, Rev. Franklin Graham did. He wrote a stirring Facebook post that moved Trump so much that he re-posted it on his Facebook account.“A lot of people are slamming evangelicals for supposedly giving Donald J. Trump a pass,” Graham began. “That’s simply not true. No one is giving him a pass. I’m certainly not, and I’ve not met an evangelical yet who condones his language or inexcusable behavior from over a decade ago.“However, he has apologized to his wife, his family, and to the American people for this. He has taken full responsibility. This election isn’t about Donald Trump’s behavior from 11 years ago or Hillary Clinton’s recent missing emails, lies, and false statements,” Graham continued.“This election is about the Supreme Court and the justices that the next president will nominate. Evangelicals are going to have to decide which candidate they trust to nominate men and women to the court who will defend the constitution and support religious freedoms.“My prayer is that Christians will not be deceived by the liberal media about what is at stake for future generations,” Graham added.The left don’t understand this, because they are mostly secular humanists. They are unable to appreciate such a powerful virtue as forgiveness, because they don’t believe in a God who can forgive our every trespass.They are under the delusion that you must be perfect or else. Either you live up to their warped standards or they’ll throw you under the bus. That’s what happened to Alec Baldwin a few years ago, when TMZ accused him of a homophobic remark. All his liberal buddies were quick to disown him, despite any real evidence.The left will never be able to understand, because they refuse to. They simply have their own agenda to protect, at all costs, and cannot conceive the ability to grow or change.Pro-Hillary Americans can’t understand that Trump is what this country needs. They are aware of his potential, but still refuse to admit it. Well, we know that, and we support Trump. Nobody cares about your opinion, Dems!What do you think about this? Comment bellow and share this story on Facebook or Twitter to spread the truth.

The companies are in “advanced talks” for a cash-and-stock deal that could be finalized as early as this weekend.

1 | Eduardo Kote Enriquez | 10154001490940950_10154001879015950 | i don't think that's going to happen at&t is to large company and would be kind of like a monopoly. it'll just be rejected but you can try u never know
2 | Joseph O'Connell | 10154001490940950_10154001496400950 | Fact: CNN is owned by Time Warner.Fact: Time Warner donated $5M to the crooked Clinton foundation and to Hillary's campaign. CNN is therefore biased and untrustworthy. CNN is in Hillary's pocket. CNN is trying to influence the outcome of this election.AT&T is in the works of purchasing Time Warner. Then AT&T will be in Hillary's pocket. Yikes.
3 | Mike Wright | 10154001490940950_10154001492790950 | The media is gonna full blitz for Trump, now that Hillary has been beaten by Jill Stein. Or, should I have said, beaten by the average joe. Jill Stein is the American that will serve Americans.
4 | Georgia Bailey | 10154001490940950_10154001575365950 | How do they think of this as a monopoly?  These companies are buying up all the options that were out there.
5 | Lori Wrobel | 10154001490940950_10154001602090950 | AT&T bought or merged with DirectTV this year right? Huge Company!
6 | Joe Armstrong | 10154001490940950_10154001527080950 | Hillary Clinton wants to establish a 65% inheritance tax on the savings and property of every Americans relatives, parents, grandparents or any other relative who "God Bless Them" pass away.  This means she wants the Federal Government to take a one-time grab using the IRS to take 65% of everything these hundreds of thousands of people strived to build and save for their entire lives.  It means as close relatives pass on in life, those they worked their entire lives will only see 35% in inheritance.  Now, don't forget...your state inheritance taxes would also have to be added to that number and would approximate on average another 15% of the total amount of the inheritance you will probably be expecting.Which means, in essence, every American would receive about 20% of the inheritance you thought you'd be getting.  Those who built their savings and properties wanted it all for you...Clinton wants to share a bit of it with you!Once this is law...just remember, you voted for Hillary.  Oh yeah, btw...Obamacare is going to double your costs in the next two years and Clinton is not getting rid of it.

1 | Barry Beck | 10154001396405950_10154001413635950 | Former pastor? Do you advertise a former McDonald's employee held up a 7/11 or that a former gardner or lineman robbed a bank. His former occupation has nothing to do with the fact that he's a douche today.
2 | Norma Jay | 10154001396405950_10154001448150950 | This is why I REALLY pay attention to behavior. Since 9/11 I've been watching behavior in public. Too many addicts, criminals, evil & mentally ill.
3 | Terri Freeman | 10154001396405950_10154001584365950 | Came her to see the irrelevant political comments. And there they are. For fucks sake people. This has nothijg to do with the election!

4 | Kristie McKeever | 10154001396405950_10154001538245950 | The Bible speaks of such people... that once the Holy Spirit washes away our sins then we turn back and rebuke the Holy spirit out, any evil that was in us brings back of its friends... on drugs or possessed... still the work of the devil.  Glad that child is ok... poor little one and poor momma.
5 | Mavis Bute | 10154001396405950_10154001607120950 | Something seriously is wrong with this man. He probably was seeing little man. He should be checked by a doctor. Certain illness dose cause these old people to do things too. Reason why they give a lot of trouble too.
6 | Chuck Rusher | 10154001396405950_10154001561765950 | NO ! His former profession does need to be mentioned. It sayes something about these jerks that go into the ministry. Wonder why they fired him from being a pastor.
7 | Lori Hozjan | 10154001396405950_10154001540440950 | This guy obviously isn't working with a full deck. Not all cylinders areFiring!! This guy has to be a total nut case!!!! Who does something like that??? I don't care how fussy that baby was there is no tolerance for this assanine behavior.

8 | Erin Stephens | 10154001396405950_10154001750770950 | Prayers for the mother of this baby. I'm sure she has nightmares about this. I hope she can get through this traumatic experience, thank God the baby is OK.  Hopefully this man can be helped...if not, may he rot in a cold cell.

FBI records show Obama used at least one pseudonym when communicating with Hillary Clinton  when she was Secretary of State.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Thomas Briggs | 10154001306460950_10154001315760950 | The idiot President contacted her with a code name. He knew all about it and lied to the Americans saying he found out about it on the news. It is sad that we have to tell CBS the facts about what is really happening. CBS, Abc, NBC are all government news propaganda machine.
2 | John McAuliffe | 10154001306460950_10154001311380950 | Obama willingly contacted Hillary, knowingly, on her insecure servers under a pseudonym
3 | Connie Yznaga Davis | 10154001306460950_10154001405655950 | Holy smokes CBS, what's up with you? It's been weeks since you posted a real story about Clinton... I can't believe it. It's a start...way...outdated and minimal, but a start. So, is this just a teaser to show you really are a legitimate news organization with journalistic integrity?? Or is it just a filler so you can get back to trouncing Trump 24/7??
4 | John Guthrie | 10154001306460950_10154001307675950 | My grandfather is voting for Hillary. Tried talking him out of it but he has been dead for a while now.
5 | Ross True | 10154001306460950_10154001312210950 | You shouldn't always believe these national polls you see in the mediaOctober 1980Carter 47%Reagan 39% (Winner)October 2000Gore 48%Bush 47% (Winner)October 2004Kerry 48%Bush 44% (Winner)October 2016Hillary 46%Trump 39% (we can only hope)
6 | Debi St Vincent Mair | 10154001306460950_10154001474750950 | Hillary is NOT good for this country.- As Secretary of State the state department "lost (missing)" $6 billion dollars- she destabilized the Middle East- She caused the death of 4 Americans in Benghazi  and lied to their families!- she destroyed 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena from congress- She accepted money from foreign countries that are tied to terrorism both to her foundation and to her campaign (Saudi money is dirty money)- She believes is late term abortions and will uphold roe v wade - She and the DNC rigged the primaries to beat Bernie Sanders- She and the DNC hired people including the mentally ill to incite violence at Trump Rallies- The main stream media has donated tons of money to her campaign and refuses to cover her crimes - Clinton was in charge of the Russian reset where she gave them our plutonium- which they used to create a nuclear arsenal that they now intended to use on US her in the USA- She is Anti second amendment and in an email said she would use executive orders to ban guns- She called latinos and blacks names (to her you are just her meal ticket, her ticket to the White House, she has done nothing but keep you all slaves of the government!)- Her husband has raped multiple women and she has threatened these women to keep them quiet. - as Secretary of State she was involved in a pay to play where donations would get you favors - She would fundamentally destroy the constitution by appointing Supreme Court justices that will impose their ideology as opposed to the rule of law* please for the love of God and Country think about what she will do to this nation. It will be worse than Obama. Please look places other than the main stream media that are in her pocket! Pray. Please make an educated decision
7 | Randy Blunk | 10154001306460950_10154001439645950 | Bill Clinton meets with DOJ Lynch for payoff/threat, 5 members of Hillary's office need immunity, one worker plead the 5th so many times he'll probably be in the Guinness Book of World Records and we just now make this connection? It used to be that reporters actually dug this kind of stuff up, but that was before the big money came and bought all the stations out and puked out the voice of whoever paid the most. It is a real shame that our 'mainstream' media is as corrupt as our government. Clinton makes Nixon look like an Eagle Scout.
8 | Gary Eckman | 10154001306460950_10154001339405950 | You guys understand that server was not a big deal, That is why no one gave a crap. The GOP turned it into a witch hunt. Guess what? No crime was committed. Sad for the GOP! Trump did rape women and will start ww3 though, so keep fishing. PUTIN for president! Right Trumpers.
9 | David Doroteo | 10154001306460950_10154001629645950 | That was the reason why they did not indict her, because if they did they would have done the same to Obama. Which would have completely destroyed their agenda.
10 | Lise Melin | 10154001306460950_10154001350520950 | Would love to see emails from Trump's campaign, or any other campaign for that matter. We all know this is inherently unfair. These emails were hacked by Russians and distributed by WikiLeaks to influence our election, and now we're learning that might not be the most disturbing aspect of this crime.
11 | Sandra Kay Durrant | 10154001306460950_10154001482430950 | Why aren't the FBI investigating the bombing in North Carolina that is a federal offense, again a cover up of the things Hillary Clinton is doing. Thank God no one died in the bombing makes you wonder though would the FBI investigate it.
12 | Matthew Quiterio | 10154001306460950_10154001798345950 | Stop talking shit about Donald Trump! the reason why you all say bad things about him is because you are all scared he right about topics and scared he goes and office and finds out the real truth . You all scared that Donald Trump Shares with America information that the government was hiding from the citizens . Example: what hides at area 51 ,USA gold reserves and other confidential files that the public should know. Hillary Clinton has been in office for so long and nothing was ever done good, war affairs and maybe those deleted e-mails have to do with the fact she knows illegal trades or e-mails with important information that she never replied! We in Canada get to see all the Nonsense that goes in the U.S.A and we want Donald Trump ,You all in U.S.A , you not outside to see what we see from our yard!
13 | Scott Partridge | 10154001306460950_10154001972300950 | I'm leaning to Trump now with all of her corrupt under the table deals along with her foundation everyone is stating they really do not pay taxes on and use it for a tax shelter.....Trump this year and we will see who is in the next election in 4 years. Sorry she burned Bernie and has to pay the price for that..!
14 | Peter Levine | 10154001306460950_10154001713030950 | When is cbs going to pick up the story of the 12 million donation the the foundation for a meeting with Hillary they took the money and soon after was given a change of status by our State Dept. When are you going to be a real news room scooping the stories no matter who it is. Right now you are not fooling anyone your the media wing of the Dems are you not just embarrassed I would be your a joke
15 | John Wade | 10154001306460950_10154001576825950 | How could anyone vote for a women who stole furniture from the state department? Not to mention she actually stole from from the White House. She ia just a common thief
16 | Richard Gougeon | 10154001306460950_10154001548425950 | Here is a survey not coming from the mainstream media supporting Hillary Clinton which reflect the real voter intents .The Rasmussen survey showed Trump at 43 percent support while Clinton was at 40 percent. It found that 87 percent of voters have locked in their votes. Among these, 48 percent supported Trump and 46 percent back Clinton. So deplorable for Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.
17 | Tom Lacerte | 10154001306460950_10154001724430950 | Bill Clinton had a secret meeting with Attorney General Lynch at the Phoenix airport, while Hillary Clinton was being investigated by the FBI. That was not an innocent coincidence. Obama's Justice Department doesn't prosecute Clinton for exposing national security secrets on her private e-mail at home. Obama's Justice Department gave all of Clinton's aides immunity for their crimes. Obama's Justice Department did everything they could, to get Hillary Clinton elected. Obama cannot be trusted.
18 | Meredith McCurdy | 10154001306460950_10154001978085950 | *** yawn ***  This is so old. People have tried for years to smear President Obama and Hillary Clinton to no avail.  They somehow keep rising to the top. When they go low....we rise high! #StrongerTogether!

21 | Tom Lacerte | 10154001306460950_10154001713330950 | Obam was Secretary of State Clinton's boss. Why didn't Obama know that Hillary Clinton was using a private e-mail server? Ignorance is not an excuse..

23 | Bob Ottaviani | 10154001306460950_10154001500350950 | Barack H. Obama is the Greatest President of Modern TimesIt is difficult to compare presidents outside of a narrow context of time. It is like trying to compare baseball players, like Ruth and Aaron, or football players, like Johnny Unitas and Peyton Manning. For athletes, the games they play were different then; and for presidents, not only the country, but the world is different.There is no way of knowing how a president today would have fared when faced with the prospect of the First or Second World War, or how they would have handled the advent of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. These are answers we can never have answered, and speculation is pointless. Despite any internal similarities, the external contexts cannot be ignored: Korea is not Vietnam and Vietnam is not Iraq.What we can do is judge them by their accomplishments, by how they faced the challenges of their time. Coming off arguably one of the most disastrous presidencies in our history, that of George W. Bush, who cut taxes yet involved us in two un-paid for wars, and crashed our economy and that of the rest of the world as a result, we found ourselves with our nation’ first black president.Not only did Barack H. Obama face the deeply entrenched racism of the nation that elected him, but a Republican Party determined to obstruct his every move, to make him a one term president and that term an utter failure. All the while, he had to face his real work, that for which he was elected: digging our nation out of the hole into which his predecessor had dragged us. And it was a deep hole. Hated by the world, our economy in shambles, two wars continuing and with no real end in sight, let alone any idea of what, exactly, would constitute victory, Barack Obama stepped up to the plate, and like Babe Ruth calling his shot, made his play. Like Ruth, he hit it out of the park. This is not hyperbole. The facts prove it.The wars are over, the economy is booming. Unemployment, like gas prices, are dropping and we have seen record levels of job growth. By any measure of success, including that of Republican candidates in 2012, his presidency has been a success. Even businesses and Wall Street agree that Republicans are killing the economy, and the evidence proves that the economy grows more under Democratic than Republican presidents. And not only did he end the wars (and without getting us into any of the new ones proposed by Republicans) and restored the economy, but he helped speed along social change by embracing marriage equality, kicking DOMA to the curb and ending Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell; he has supported women’s rights, including equal pay and the right to manage their own reproductive rights; He has fought for workers and for a living wage; battled on behalf of the environment; and fought for the rights of immigrants. And with the Affordable Care Act, known fittingly as Obamacare, he has given all Americans access to healthcare for the first time in our nation’s history.His list of accomplishments, even minus any opposition, would be staggering. Considering the odds against him, they are truly monumental. In all these areas, he has made life better for Americans. Not just for the rich, but for all Americans.Right off the bat, President Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize. This was a measure of the world’s relief at being rid of President Bush as much as anything else. The world heaved a sigh of relief. And that alone spurred the much-needed cycle of healing. But it is what President Obama did as himself, rather than as not-Bush, that has really sealed his legacy. We have just seen that he has been named by Americans as the most admired man in the world for the seventh straight year. There is good reason for that. And it is not because he is FDR or JFK or even Abraham Lincoln. It is because he is Barack H. Obama, and that is no small thing in itself. He was, like so many other great men in our nation’s history, the right man in the right place at the right time. And he answered the call.He may not have been as liberal as some of us would have liked, but neither was he as far left as Republicans imagined. That he seemed to them to be a Marxist shows not how far left Obama was but how far Right they had moved. In many respects, Obama is a Republican out of the past, embracing many policies once embraced by the GOP. These make him much more of a centrist than someone to the far left of the political spectrum. But that might have been exactly what we needed in 2008.Some have complained and continue to complain that Obama did not bring the change he promised, but he did bring change, and a great deal of it. Republicans have asked if we miss Bush yet. No, resoundingly, we do not. We can quibble, but it would be wrong to judge him according to what he did or did not do from our own personal lists of things we wanted done. What matters, and what alone matters, are the results.And the results, as I pointed to above, are spectacular. Despite a steadfast refusal to do their jobs, despite every roadblock Republicans could put in his path, President Obama has persevered, with class and with style, holding his head up proudly like the American he is, sharing credit for his successes and accepting responsibility for his failures.It is impossible not to compare Bush and Obama: the man who got us into war and the man who got us out of it; the man who destroyed the economy and the man who restored it; the man who alienated the world and the man who makes friends of enemies, including Cuba.

25 | Stoney Williamson | 10154001306460950_10154001826995950 | Indeed there is something new in the air! The lies and criminal acts of Hillary and her associates is coming to the public compliments of Wikileaks. There is no need for the "mainstream media" anymore. You people attempt to silence the proof of Hillary and her cohorts, you divert any questions in reference to the revelations that has been revealed to the public! When confronted with what has been done at her direction or on her behalf she blames Russia. She does not deny the emails, she blames someone else for informing the world of her criminal activity.

Investigators say two women panicked when they found their 94-year-old father dead in his home. So, they buried him in the yard.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Diana Mendoza | 10154001239175950_10154001253210950 | They are what? In the 60's or 70's? Never married.  Yet they still collected and used his social security? If they don't get them for the dad's death, Social Security will get them for theft.
2 | Brandy Curtis | 10154001239175950_10154001312540950 | Okay, first, no where in the article did it say the daughters collected his social security,  so just stop with that.  Second, good point, who comes home and find a dead elderly relative and panics but still has the where with all to bury them? Third,  why would a brother who hasn't spoken to the man in nine years,  that's atleast four years before he died, know to report him missing? Fourth,  why did the daughters lie and say he moved up North, defeats the "they were keeping his social security" theory? And finally, who was the mysterious third person,  who knew he was buried in the back yard, to tip the police off?
3 | Dawn Fields-Walker | 10154001239175950_10154001242680950 | Bet they kept collecting his social security checks. Why panic.
4 | Sherri J Shipley James | 10154001239175950_10154001260715950 | People have been known for this as long as no fowl play and the daughters were not benefiting from his social security see nothing wrong with it.
5 | Harry T Miller | 10154001239175950_10154001260420950 | What is wrong with these crazy people! Hope social security makes them pay back every dime they stole! And his spirit bothers there conscious and they leave this life in a painful, miserable way!
6 | Sharon Greenawalt | 10154001239175950_10154001293395950 | I don't understand the panic part. Unless he was paying their way and they wanted that to continue.  Or maybe they couldn't afford a funeral and didn't know what to do. Very odd, the whole thing.
7 | Michelle O'Need | 10154001239175950_10154001508700950 | Michelle Obama's mom has been living in the White House all this time, declared herself the nanny and will collect 160k in pension. Nice, huh? For taking care of your own kids
8 | Maria Resendes | 10154001239175950_10154001343305950 | Come to think of it it's not a bad idea dad is home, in the backyard, it's cheaper too funeral charge an arm and a leg theses days
9 | Barry Beck | 10154001239175950_10154001269810950 | We once buried our own. In some places it is still done.
10 | Yuri Diotz | 10154001239175950_10154001329025950 | Big mistake. You have to go through the funeral industrial complex first. Can't die without getting fleeced
11 | Yvonne Clerebout | 10154001239175950_10154001288760950 | Joe Biden inciting violence saying he would beat Trump. What a horrible thing to say, not only was he inciting violence against Trump and his supporters but he's telling kids it's O.K. to use violence against opponents. Ugly, Nasty man.
12 | Taylor Madison | 10154001239175950_10154001275955950 | How strange! Who comes home to find a deceased relative and takes them out to the yard and buries them?! What back alley living is this?
13 | Kristin Brazelton | 10154001239175950_10154001796420950 | Well they'd have to be in their 60's-70's... you'd think they'd know better?
14 | Gabrielle Beell | 10154001239175950_10154001549125950 | Why would you panic that doesn't even make sense unless they are doing something illegal...
15 | Kathy Sullivan Tate | 10154001239175950_10154001254530950 | So disrespectful ! What about calling 911 if you didn't do anything wrong?
16 | Kerrien Jari | 10154001239175950_10154001978925950 | Tried to avoid the funeral cost, that would be my first guess.
17 | Joe Anthony | 10154001239175950_10154001246015950 | Why panic if you did nothing wrong? Right?
18 | Jim Polo Sr | 10154001239175950_10154001563190950 | Really. Your grandfather is not your pet parakeet. ...How many laws did they violate? What a disgraceful way to handle the death of a close relative.
19 | The Truth is Here | 10154001239175950_10154001239675950 | Dear person reading this,I hope your day has been going well, if not, I hope it gets better You are an amazing person who will inspire others to do great things so keep up the hard work. FOLLOW US TO LEARN THE TRUTH !

The end is near! Early voting has officially begun in counties across North Carolina, and fed up voters are thrilled: "We just wanted to vote and get it over with" http://cbsn.ws/2eu7vMP

1 | David Nealy | 10154001176820950_10154001275220950 | I live in NC and the state just voted in a republican house, senate and governor last go around. I really do not see HC  taking N.C. I do believe the media is  trying to make it sound like its a close one for ratings, but I am pretty sure reality is about to slap them in the face.
2 | Lola Tortola | 10154001176820950_10154001182375950 | November 9th , when the election is over, can not come soon enough. At this point, everyone has made up their minds who they are voting for, no one has anything new to bring to the table, and I pray the divisions amongst friends and family will be repaired, and quickly. Looking forward to a break from all of the vile rhetoric and bashing, from all sides.
3 | Shane Snyder | 10154001176820950_10154001195690950 | If I've learned anything from the media this week it's that American's simply can NOT rig our very secure and complex election systems... but, Russian's can.Meanwhile, CBS is still not reporting on democrats actually admitting to voter fraud and voter intimidation.#RIPJournalism https://d1sb17b1leotpq.cloudfront.net/rigging-election-%E2%80%93-video-ii-mass-voter-fraud.html
4 | Scott Partridge | 10154001176820950_10154001973770950 | I'm leaning to Trump now with all of her corrupt under the table deals along with her foundation everyone is stating they really do not pay taxes on and use it for a tax shelter.....Trump this year and we will see who is in the next election in 4 years. Sorry she burned Bernie and has to pay the price for that..!
5 | Ron Griffin | 10154001176820950_10154001287635950 | Hillary is killing 9 and 8 month term babies that is enough not to vote for her. She stated it in the last debate. To vote for her will add your name to God's judgement on this genocide.
6 | Jack Griffin | 10154001176820950_10154001828290950 | Like anybody put up signs.. This is the first election that I saw only one sign and it was for Hitlery.... Dems attack anybody that dares disagree with them..... If Trump had no chance of winning they would not be attacking him 87 times an hour.......... Libs are scared sh-tless
7 | Ruben Pereida | 10154001176820950_10154001483590950 | Its just the beginning. We are going to be a divided nation until we can come together and understand the other sides interests. We as a people have a long way to go to be united again no matter the outcome of this election.
8 | Joe Jensen | 10154001176820950_10154001270845950 | Such a biased news media. Why don't you tell about the corruption that the Clintons have perpetrated for years against their adversaries.

Gee that sounds like a fair poll!Hidden within their details is this little factoid: of their 1,179 respondents, 23.6 percent were Republican and 57 percent were Democrat. This is in a state where voter registration is 35 percent GOP and 30 percent Democrat. It’s so biased and skewed that it cannot possibly be considered an accurate poll. Period.

In 1975, actress Lynda Carter first brought "Wonder Woman" to American TV screens. This year, the superhero turns 75.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Damian Blankenship | 10154001123755950_10154001545910950 | Lynda Carter's birthday is July 24th, 1951, making HER 65. I realize it says "the superhero turns 75", but the writing is piss poor.
2 | Diana Crosby- Wilson | 10154001123755950_10154001302375950 | Just read in the New York Times that they are actually petitioning against Wonder Woman because it's not ideal to have a " fictional big breasted White woman in a shiny costume be a representative of strong women" that an actual living person should have been chosen. Me personally I love Wonder Woman and don't see why she can't a positive role model.
3 | Evelyn Campbell | 10154001123755950_10154001970975950 | Um why are they honoring her an actress. When there's thousands of regular humanitarians around the world?
4 | Josephine Palacios | 10154001123755950_10154001234285950 | She looks so amazing for 75 yrs old. Wow..... she is really wonder woman
5 | Hauoli Paz | 10154001123755950_10154001188370950 | What a great role model she was for young women going up in the 70s!  We had so few women in any roles for self modeling
6 | Gloria Schmitz | 10154001123755950_10154001139680950 | The U.N. has time for this?  Oh my God, are we in for it!
7 | Gary Eckman | 10154001123755950_10154001348095950 | Look out Lynda, Trump could be lurking at the UN? be careful. He is a pig.
8 | Tim Moorhead | 10154001123755950_10154001237060950 | She's a Wonder Woman alright.

Donald Trump rallies to an Ohio crowd and reminds the audience the system is "rigged."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Alex P. Reed | 10154001036390950_10154001055840950 | Sad thing is, there's a lot of gullible people who believe him. It's funny how Hilary Clinton is so easy for some to ridicule, when before this election, you didn't give a damn about Donald Trump or what he stands for. Bandwagoners.
2 | Gary Eckman | 10154001036390950_10154001042950950 | Rigged by Trump and putin!This happened today, Half the sites we all used were hit by a Wave of Attack. The ddos servers were pushed too hard and shut down. This is what Putin brings to the party! This is what Trump wants!Trump should be ashamed of Hugging putin! Shame.Putin is a disaster, and not a friend to the USA! Neither is Trump!#ddos #putin #trump #loser
3 | Mykal Plum | 10154001036390950_10154001078270950 | He knows his followers are ignorant enough to believe anything thrown at them. Remember when Trump said he could shoot somebody and not lose any of his followers? They are that gullible.
4 | Terri Lynn | 10154001036390950_10154001084990950 | So it's rigged if you lose, but what if Hillary loses?   Is it still rigged then?Sore loser, sad man trying to represent this great country of freedom and democracy.
5 | Gloria Hemlepp-Chavez | 10154001036390950_10154001083185950 | It's only rigged when you are clearly loosing. Funny for someone who likes calling people "losers," he is the "bigly-est" of them all 😂
6 | Suzanne Genow | 10154001036390950_10154001174865950 | The election is NOT rigged.   Trump is losing ALL on his own because of what he stands for.    For him to continue with this ridiculous talk is degrading and undermining the democracy of the US and ALL of us as FREE citizens to make choices.
7 | Debra Watters | 10154001036390950_10154001151145950 | Nothing is ever Trumps fault! His business's that failed? someone else's fault. All of the hundreds of Women Trump has admitted to assaulting!, I never said That! Not My Fault! It's Hillary's fault! He is the biggest Loser ever!! He will deny ever losing in his life! It's a rigged system!! Lost awards for his tv show! Rigged system! It's true Donald everyone is against you!!
8 | Tammy Hart | 10154001036390950_10154001183825950 | The media is so biased against Donald Trump...people are confused cause they only hear bits and pieces of Hillary Clinton so they don't believe most....but they sure can put all trumps shit on the news.....biased assholes
9 | Lola Tortola | 10154001036390950_10154001125615950 | November 9th , when the election is over, can not come soon enough. At this point, everyone has made up their minds who they are voting for, no one has anything new to bring to the table, and I pray the divisions amongst friends and family will be repaired, and quickly. Looking forward to a break from all of the vile rhetoric and bashing, from all sides. We need a break!!!
10 | Michael Clark | 10154001036390950_10154001121325950 | C'mon now, does this really sound to you like a guy that's trying to be the president? It's rigged alright but he's part of the rigging. There's 4 candidates on the ballot but you only get to hear from the red one and the blue one. After Ross Perot in 92, the rules changed to only allow candidates in the debates if they had 15% of the vote. Who decides if a candidate has 15% before any votes are even cast? The polls. And we accept the polling results right? Ross Perot would never have been allowed to debate if the 15% rule had been in place. Sure it's rigged.  And we just pretend it's not because the others two candidates would just lose anyway, right?
11 | Nabil Saad | 10154001036390950_10154001121230950 | We got it LOSER, I do believe you just felt the taste of losing and that is why, any thing not goes your way it is Wrong or Rigged....You'll not lose this election but the world will lose respect for you and your scams....We Got it Duck...
12 | Byron Grant Sr. | 10154001036390950_10154001196500950 | The only thing that's being rigged is the minds of Donald Trump supporters who don't realize they're being bamboozled by a con artist/pimp/hustler ...
13 | Missie McKinley Allen | 10154001036390950_10154001140340950 | well what do you expect President Donald Trump it was all G W Bush's fault now it is all your fault!!   They all must be real proud to be a supporters of a woman (and i use that term very loosely) that not only killed 4 Americans in Benghazi but she also wants to kill babies too!! Maybe you should watch 13 hours...most of it is true but they left out the part where after hours and hours of calling for backup and assistance Chris Stevens was raped, sodomized and tortured to death by the very people she receives donations from!! And oh yeah but Trump says mean things about women!! Almost forgot!!
14 | Jason R. Weir | 10154001036390950_10154001612985950 | This is the biggest cry baby I have ever seen. Everything is rigged if he's losing. It's funny, I don't remember any of his disciples talking about the 22 million missing emails from the Bush administration or the danger of non-existent weapons of mass destruction.
15 | Ann Schoonover | 10154001036390950_10154001226165950 | Masters of deflection... Thank you, Trump and Company for (trying to) tear America down in contrast to your stupid campaign slogan.
16 | Michael Woodworth | 10154001036390950_10154001214955950 | Would love to see the Stuff in his campaign!!! Hahahahah politics ain't pretty but it's has to be done!!!! And It's not Hillary!!! But he keeps saying Hillary Clinton email!! No one can control someone else's thoughts except Donald Trump!!!
17 | David C. Nasworthy | 10154001036390950_10154001726615950 | Weren't you guys just caught falsifying polls for the DNC?Don't you think we can see for ourselves how well Mr Trump doing in our own states? Then we read your polls and "stories" about how well Clinton is doing and we KNOW your being, not only biased, but fraudulent. How long do you expect the decent tolerant majority to take that? You're supposed to be one of the"checks and balances" in this society, instead you have become a society of tabloid journalists, available to whoever your bosses are told to support.
18 | Tonia Dicus Schuck | 10154001036390950_10154001382795950 | VOTE FOR JOHNSON!!! Gary Johnson owns his mistakes & moves forward. He's honest & real! I am voting for him because of that & the fact that he is passionate about making this country better for us all. He'll be the middle man between the republicans & democrats & I really think he'll get them to work together to get things done. He's one of US. He will always do what's best for US & not the wealthy or huge corporations. He'll be fair to the young & to the old,which is why I feel he's polling so high with millennials. He's not going to worry so much about taking care of other countries bc that's not our problem & we shouldn't be in the middle of their problems in the first place! He's gonna keep our military where they belong. Protecting us & our freedoms. Which is why he's polling so high with active military! And he's gonna save us MILLIONS by doing this!! He's gonna give us back control of our own lives. He's gonna legalize marijuana which is gonna save us all by stopping big pharma from controlling us in so many ways & save MILLIONS by letting all of those people out that are imprisoned for petty marijuana related crimes. Seriously, the #1 arrest is for marijuana related crimes?! That's INSANE!! There are far more important things our law enforcement, courts & prisons could be spending their time & money on! Imagine how much we'd save if marijuana was legalized & how many jobs would be created in each state to meet the demands medicinally & recreationally &  finally we'd MAKE some money off of it by taxing it the same way we do liquor & cigarettes!!He's gonna create more programs to help people with deadly drug addictions instead of putting them in prison & costing us more money! Johnson & Weld are so real & down to earth, I feel like they'd listen to any one of us if we had something to say & even more, they'd help in any way they could!! SAY NO TOBIG GOVERNMENT & YES TO JOHNSON!! ❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️
19 | Cristine Sarkine-Watson | 10154001036390950_10154001082290950 | He's an ass the crap he says that has everyone in a uproar exciting riots then comes back with systems are rigged neither one should be able to run
20 | Adam White | 10154001036390950_10154001577350950 | he's correct,just look and listen to the recent dnc tapes,they intentionally rgged the conventions using violence and paid protesters,so what makes us think they will not rigg the voting booths and mail in votes...vote trump people
21 | Michael Spear | 10154001036390950_10154001248290950 | Media whores. Of course it's rigged. Democrats have lied and cheated during every aspect of this election and you think all of a sudden they are going to develop a conscience ? You've got another think coming.
22 | Waunema Reagan | 10154001036390950_10154001439640950 | I wish your morning  and evening  news spent equal time reporting good and bad and both candidates.  You show your favoritism to the point I want to turn you off. My expectations of a news report regarding the candidates is that you report facts on both and allow us, the public to decide.
23 | Ricky A Don | 10154001036390950_10154001430565950 | Can I say the American justice system is rigged against minority? ? No i cant because no white person believe that only when this orange ugly face nut ass say so its rigged. .get the hell out of here..
24 | Brian Simpson | 10154001036390950_10154001112750950 | To all who read this stuffIf your all happy and like everything that's going on , well , vote for Hillary , but if you see what's going on and don't want to see our country turn into a country that Hillary wants , then vote Trump . Myself will be voting for the right "man" for the job .
25 | Dave Neal | 10154001036390950_10154001245350950 | Here is what they have been doing in all the polls that have Hillary leading.Hidden within their details is this little factoid: of their 1,179 respondents, 23.6 percent were Republican and 57 percent were Democrat. This is in a state where voter registration is 35 percent GOP and 30 percent Democrat. It’s so biased and skewed that it cannot possibly be considered an accurate poll. Period.http://thefederalistpapers.org/us/poll-shows-trump-5-points-behind-in-az-just-one-huge-problem

When doctors told Joey Maxwell his beloved golden retriever, Maverick, wouldn't make it much longer, he determined to give the dog one last special day. What happened next blew him away.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Krupali Kaneyalal Tejura | 10154001029150950_10154001069710950 | May you and your wife keep special memories of maverick forever in your hearts. What a special soul, thank you and thank you Lowe's for helping out in a time of need.
2 | Laura McDowell Pierce | 10154001029150950_10154001198255950 | What a precious story. Dogs love us unconditionally. How I wish that we as humans could do that towards one another. I will pray that your precious baby will be around much longer for him to continue to spread love and receive love from all those around them.
3 | Billy Liljeroos | 10154001029150950_10154001112565950 | Thanks for making me cry............. I will do the same thing for my buddy Bandit when that time comes hopefully a long time from now.  he will get the best of everything
4 | Mary Velez | 10154001029150950_10154001632165950 | I am not a dog person, but your story was so touching, I am in tears as I write this, may Saint Francis watch over Maverick.

12 | Dewayne L. Morgan | 10154001029150950_10154001034870950 | Congress just announced the most outrageous waste of taxpayer money designed by Obama.First Grandma Marian Robinson, 79, will receive a lifetime 160K government pension when she leaves the White House next year, according to congressional budget statements.According to documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mrs. Robinson earned the lifetime pension for “services rendered as full-time/in-home caregiver” for granddaughters Malia, 18, and Sasha, 15, during President Obama’s two terms in office.This is shameful, blatant stealing!They are going to pay her $160,000 every year for the rest of her life for babysitting her own granddaughters. WHAT A CORRUPT FAMILY!A pension that’s THREE TIMES bigger than the average American family’s income. She babysat her own grandkids.

And, all those strangers uniting to help was a true testament of how, no matter our differences, we really care about others.

Timothy Cardinal Dolan saw a different side of Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump before the big roast at the Al Smith dinner.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Cully Ray | 10154000948160950_10154000966700950 | If - IF - this is true then I have to ask, WTH is Trump playing at in public? He, as a candidate, has stired up more hate and division than I have seen in 50 years. What is his goal???
2 | Bambi Flategraff | 10154000948160950_10154001034605950 | 🇺🇸🇺🇸 It's no longer about Republican vs. Democrat.It's all of us Americans vs the Politicians, the media, special interests, lobbyists, foreign countries, Wall Street, the drug companies, hollywood, and the Washington elitist.Never again will we have a chance to take our country back from the globalist agenda they're cramming down our throats, It's now, or never.Please get out and vote, do it for your children & your grandchildren. Stop the Muslim invasion of our country and our way of life. Be true to your country, your values, and your heritage. Vote for the American, not the politician.God Bless.🇺🇸🇺🇸
3 | Ali Omar | 10154000948160950_10154000949510950 | Trump is better than Hillary . Hillary is against any change , choose Trump if you want change.
4 | Cammie Nguyen | 10154000948160950_10154001123840950 | Conspiracy theory, anyone? Here's a thought. This is all a setup to get Hillary in office. Trump and Hillary are secretly working together and Trump is a mole for the Democratic party, purposely sabotaging his campaign to ensure Hillary's victory. I mean, no one is literally that stupid to do and say the things he's said, right? Right? Right? 🤔 But then again, Trump has always defy the odds.
5 | Tina-Bill Cartell | 10154000948160950_10154001054530950 | Cardinal Dolan said that the two of them spoke ( Trump and Clinton) and he stated what Trump had said to Clinton witch was decent but he only stated that Clinton replied but did not state what her reply was. Now either I missed something or her reply wasn't so nice just the same as her hand shake in the photo....Trump shook hands with her but her hand was far from a hand shake. Just as Trump said she is a Nasty Woman! I need to make a edit to my statement above because I did miss read the comment on Clintons reply because she did state that they would have to work together ( not exact quote but close) I miss read and took that to be part of Trumps statement....but still think she is a nasty person.
6 | Dale Smith | 10154000948160950_10154000967395950 | Reason why Hillary Clinton has been Acting sooo SMUG , she knows the Fix is in.Hillary's organized Cabal has The Voting system Rigged— it has been for a Long Time.Washington, DC is Broken,,Both Parties are puppets of the Top 1%,,Hillary Clinton's people.
7 | Jennifer Lee Evans | 10154000948160950_10154000989210950 | Lynn C Daniels I do not find that odd at all actually. I have said from the beginning that seeing as how they were friends that they made an agreement of some sort to not be mad at each other for anything they say about the other and when it's all said and done they will be friends again. I wouldn't be surprised to find out they call each other every night and laugh at all the stuff they make us believe. Not surprised at all.
8 | Roger McMahan | 10154000948160950_10154000964790950 | last time they was in the white house they stole $200.000 worth of stuff and defaced the walls,...as a land owner myself if i had people like that once i'd be crazy to let them back in
9 | Matthew Quiterio | 10154000948160950_10154001800265950 | Stop talking shit about Donald Trump! the reason why you all say bad things about him is because you are all scared he right about topics and scared he goes and office and finds out the real truth . You all scared that Donald Trump Shares with America information that the government was hiding from the citizens . Example: what hides at area 51 ,USA gold reserves and other confidential files that the public should know. Hillary Clinton has been in office for so long and nothing was ever done good, war affairs and maybe those deleted e-mails have to do with the fact she knows illegal trades or e-mails with important information that she never replied! We in Canada get to see all the Nonsense that goes in the U.S.A and we want Donald Trump ,You all in U.S.A , you not outside to see what we see from our yard!
10 | Matthew Kaye | 10154000948160950_10154001048350950 | Hillary has helped us to tenderly hold the Muslim Brotherhood next to our hearts , and to look to Political Islam for guidance and wisdom . Love Islam , and vote for Hillary Clinton . America needs the Muslim Brotherhood more now then ever . America will be Wahhabi by the time Hillary Clinton leaves the White House . Prepare .
11 | Lisa Ann Mcgatha | 10154000948160950_10154001179720950 | It's still TRUMP 2016. I don't believe anything the media has to say any more to many lies and they feed off of Drama. SMDH
12 | Rosemary Niswonger-Muse | 10154000948160950_10154001278005950 | Thank you, Mr Trump for starting this journey for Us! I know you had better things to do, than endure the liars and backstabbers for Us!  I know you had better things to spend your money on, instead of fighting for Us!  I know you're giving up your time with your own family to care about Us! Thank you for sending help, though you didn't have to, to those of Us who are displaced due to Natural Disasters! Thank you for shaking our hands. Thank you for hugging our children. Thank you for Caring about the future of our Grandchildren! Thank you for Loving our Country! Thank you for taking a Stand against Corrupt Government! Mr Trump has the Endorsement of Christian Leaders such as, Dr James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr, and Franklin Graham! Mr Trump, We The People Are Behind You! With much gratitude, An American Citizen!
13 | Bill Hughes | 10154000948160950_10154001726995950 | People booed Trump because they know he was telling the truth and they do not want to admit it. One day Clinton is telling us the Catholic church is a Medieval monstrosity that needs to wake up, the next how much she loves them. It cant be both ways.
14 | Gary Eckman | 10154000948160950_10154001054615950 | Dolan said Trump “turned to Clinton and said, ‘You know, you are one tough and talented woman,’” and Dolan said Trump added, “This has been a good experience -- this whole campaign -- as tough as it’s been.”“Whatever happens, we need to work together afterwards,” Clinton responded
15 | Diana Mendoza | 10154000948160950_10154001006845950 | The fact is they were family friends long before this campaign.   Campaigns can bring out the ugly in everyone including the voters.
16 | Troy Manley | 10154000948160950_10154000995100950 | The only people that booed Trump was the ones from the media that he announced; lol they didn't like getting busted out on all their lies.
17 | Gloria Schmitz | 10154000948160950_10154001143785950 | Why didn't that cardinal there stop the insults? That black woman pastor stopped Trump a couple months ago, saying it wasn't a political rally?
18 | Lou Brody | 10154000948160950_10154001106290950 | Well, it was true.  One of the leaked emails, from Hillary and her team said Catholics were bastardized.
19 | Fred Vicente | 10154000948160950_10154000950095950 | 12 year old girl brutally raped and she is attacked by Hillary. She laughed and blamed the child. And her husband Bill raped at least 4 women as she looked away. Be proud pedophile and rapist supporting Democrat party and liberal media!
20 | Charles Gardner | 10154000948160950_10154000948415950 | Hillary has lied, stole, cheated....shouldn't be on stage❌❌❌Hillary is a lying untrustworthy crook...and already lost❌❌❌
21 | Pamela Antilla | 10154000948160950_10154001036120950 | Cardinal Dolan also said Hillary should appologize to Catholics....dont hold your breathe
22 | Vicki Lague | 10154000948160950_10154001287395950 | IF this is true, then apparently Trump has one opinion in public and another opinion in private. Hmm. Sounds familiar.
23 | Shirley Bateman | 10154000948160950_10154001261340950 | I saw the whole speech, yes both candidates took jabs at each other. But trump got down and viscious and booed more times I can count. Hillary did take jabs but not to the extent trump  did . Hillary  went HIGH & focused why she was there! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0ryocAv8Zw
24 | Dave Denomie | 10154000948160950_10154000954140950 | The "pretending she doesn't hate Catholics" line was not a joke, purely a mean attack, and he deserved the loud booing that he got for it.
25 | Jim Player | 10154000948160950_10154001031825950 | It wasn't private....in was said in front of a Cardinal at a public event.

When she spotted a piece of paper tucked under her windshield wipers, she thought she was getting fined for leaving her car in a parking lot overnight. But when she took a closer look at the writing on the page, she was left speechless...

1 | Terri Freeman | 10154000884160950_10154000906175950 | This story has nothing to do with anything political and yet here they are! Comments about stupid liberals and trump. Goddam. I cant go to the comment section of a single story without someone just having to say some asinine political comment. Please, for the love of all that is good in this world, find something else to talk about for 5 fucking minutes! Having said that, this was a great story
2 | Travis Smith | 10154000884160950_10154000910265950 | That's pretty cool to see that. I've lost loved ones due to drinking and driving so be kind for folks stepping up and not doing it is great. Good for the bar owner.
3 | Rob Swart | 10154000884160950_10154001011915950 | One of the biggest fears of a person who has drank too much to drive is that their car will be towed if they leave it. If those who want to stop drunk driving really want that goal, they need to change parking laws and policies.
4 | Steph Lane | 10154000884160950_10154000973190950 | I wonder how many people would leave their cars parked if they were assured that they wouldn't come back to it in the morning towed or with a ticket. Obviously a driver should still be responsible, regardless, but ijs.
5 | Barry Kintner | 10154000884160950_10154000930075950 | - Good all around - IF she was drinking (had a good evening for her) and I (personally) HATE drunks / drunk drivers, and left her car there (left with someone?) to have a great night too - then came back to a nice note (and the car still there!). - ALL good things.
6 | William Marques | 10154000884160950_10154001063450950 | I wish more Bars would treat patrons this way. There was a time when a designated driver could get free sodas; I pay as much for a Bar soda as most do for thier drinks; now when I leave a club I am walking through a group of Police Officers just outside the door watching for someone to walk to their vehicle. Good thing, they are trying to keep drunk drivers off the road.
7 | Casey Braun | 10154000884160950_10154000933045950 | This is amazing. I have not personally lost a loved one due to drinkng and driving but, my husband will never know his aunt because of it. I'm happy she (the one in the story) didn't drive home and to reinforce the patrons positive behavior for NOT drinking and driving was unnecessary but, very wonderful!
8 | Trisha Byerly | 10154000884160950_10154001111730950 | Wow this is awesome. I'm always afraid to leave my car anywhere cause nowadays you will get your car towed. I'm glad some people still care about others safety.
9 | Laura Jaketic | 10154000884160950_10154001357465950 | What a great read! I wish more establishments did that! They don't even have to leave a voucher for food! Just a kind note would surfice.  Happy weekend everyone!  Take an Uber or Taxi when you go out and be safe! Cheers!
10 | Jill Renae | 10154000884160950_10154001074605950 | How awesome is this! I wish more places did this just because it might encourage people to think twice about putting their lives and others' lives in danger.
11 | Abner Marsh | 10154000884160950_10154001053700950 | It'd be cool if she was drinking that night and got a ride home from someone else! But I didn't see in the article if she said she was drinking? Did that owner just assume she was?
12 | Diana Mendoza | 10154000884160950_10154000982660950 | Obviously they've had issues with drunks leaving and driving off. Now I bet a lot more people will park there even if they weren't customers. Just for the free chicken wings.
13 | Tamara M. Smith | 10154000884160950_10154001627285950 | How does shit like this make the news but boy gets beat in foster care courts surrender child to mom's rapist. All for having ovarian cancer. Mom asked for help. No looses son to a rapist whom also likes minor's have proof he had .. how is this happening n no one will listen? Is it because I'm poor?
14 | Rosie Conley | 10154000884160950_10154000906020950 | This guy is awesome! More bars should do this!
15 | Marlene Morales Blanco | 10154000884160950_10154000953275950 | 👏👏👏 taking advantage of it or not, it doesn't matter as long as it keeps drunk people off the streets 😆
16 | Pythia Sibyls | 10154000884160950_10154000986345950 | I lived above a bar called "Stanley's" across the highway from UIC Pavilion and the horrors I've seen leaving their parking lot left me stunned. People driving the wrong way down a 1 way street. EMPLOYEES being unable to walk to their cars at the end of the night and hitting the fence on their way out. Women being found splayed on the ground in the alley passed out and when management was informed, they took money out of her purse to pay for a cab to take her to the address on her driver's license. Drunken Racist fights spilling out into the street. The staff and owner smoking weed, drinking, and doing coke... Domestic violence in the parking lot.They never, EVER cut anyone off even if they ended up covering the parking lot in vomit! It was truly terrifying what these scumbags allowed and it is refreshing to see a business that actually cares about their patrons and neighbors.
17 | Sabrina Pol | 10154000884160950_10154001042440950 | Canadians, man. So consistently nice it puts the rest of us to shame haha
18 | Saro Rivera | 10154000884160950_10154000906410950 | I starting to believe these stories are nothing but, hog-wash
19 | Engene Pang | 10154000884160950_10154002004755950 | Instead, it was a letter from the manager of Original Joe’s Restaurant & Bar in Sherwood Park, Canada.“Just wanted to thank you for leaving your car parked overnight,” Jay McLean, managing partner at Original Joe’s, wrote. “I’m not sure if you had consumed alcohol at our restaurant or not, but we wanted to thank you for not drinking and driving.”Enclosed, Grzelak-Schultz also found a voucher for 1 pound of chicken wings.“Please accept this as a thank you for being responsible,” McLean wrote. “Life is valuable, have a great weekend.”Grzelak-Schultz was touched.“I was sure it was going to be a ticket or a scolding from someone for leaving my vehicle there for so long,” Grzelak-SchultzI told CBS News. “I was truly surprised and so pleased that the manager took the time to acknowledge my good judgement.”She decided to share the man’s good deed on Facebook.
20 | Marcus James Occhialini | 10154000884160950_10154000893865950 | Wow, look at all of the spam comments...
21 | Delmar Brown | 10154000884160950_10154001731305950 | I wish things were this way right now. Instead we just fight. Ugh
22 | Tammie Faulkner Taylor | 10154000884160950_10154000936710950 | Now random people will leave their car there overnight for free food vouchers!  LolCool story though!
23 | Susan Bryson | 10154000884160950_10154000956940950 | Now every drunk in town will leave their car parked there 😂

A thrift store worker found photos in a tote bag he'd donated of him sexually assaulting a toddler — estimated to be 16 to 18 months old at the time, prosecutors say.

1 | Mary Ragan | 10154000818350950_10154000830185950 | One quick shot to the head is all he needs. People this sick should not be among the living they were born with a malfunction and just drain the system.
2 | Adam Bence | 10154000818350950_10154001011525950 | This is horrible and absolutely disgusting. But can we talk about the post for a second? "A thrift store worker found photos in a tote bag he'd donated of him sexually assaulting a toddler" That sounds like the thrift store worker donated a tote bag which had photos of himself sexually assaulting a toddler. Do you guys not proof read your own stuff??
3 | Crystal Evans Howard | 10154000818350950_10154000825975950 | What in all kinds of hell?? Gawd, when you think you read the worse thing EVER... Hope he was dragged out into the streets and shot.

5 | Demi Lynn | 10154000818350950_10154000987660950 | Trump supporters keep telling themselves that skin color determines whether you are good or bad. I have news for you hyper-partisan mind-controlled clowns: EVIL EXISTS INDEPENDENT OF SKIN COLOR. Lying to yourself isn't helping.
6 | Victoria Sharpe | 10154000818350950_10154000953195950 | The only sentence for pedophiles once convicted she be death! There is no cure or treatment for them. NO SECOND CHANCES!🔪 And hey if all these cops having aggression issues can use pedophiles as target practice.

14 | Carol Ann | 10154000818350950_10154000883980950 | Uhm. Who wrote the headline? They made it sound like the worker donated the bag and found his own photos. Lol
15 | Jeff Singleton | 10154000818350950_10154000925300950 | Why was there even a court hearing and a plea, he should of been tortured and shot. P.o.s.

2 | John Baltmore | 10154000738965950_10154000832425950 | Obama declares war on Russia and Russia takes down our internet and crippled America. I think I speak for everyone when I say "obama shut the fuck up"
3 | T.R. Williams | 10154000738965950_10154000786165950 | Hildebeast blames Russia when the podesta files, via Wikileaks shows she was in bed with Russia buying shares in their energy plant, along with podesta and the rest of her cronies, this is just a ploy this administration to set a false flag diversion
4 | Sorcha Anya Fox | 10154000738965950_10154000743375950 | You report nothing anymore and are just a Democrat propaganda machine. BOYCOTT CBS NEWS.
5 | Kevin Watson | 10154000738965950_10154000744675950 | Yeah, it was turned over to basically the UN. People better get use to being silenced and them blaming it on something else.
6 | Brian Croner | 10154000738965950_10154000812380950 | Talk to John Kerry or Obama about this - they're the ones behind this cyber attack to keep Wikileaks info from filtering into the country.
7 | Venison Turner | 10154000738965950_10154001666635950 | Suggestion: If the DNS is down then website names can't be translated into IP addresses. So if you acquired the IP addresses of sites that you frequent in advance, you could reach them without the DNS servers, right?
8 | Sandy Skinner | 10154000738965950_10154001178190950 | Since Wikileaks has proven how corrupt the media and our government are, I wouldn't put it pass them to play their little games to quiet Wikileaks.
9 | Barry Kintner | 10154000738965950_10154000826785950 | - Ya know - I could have READ this entire thing in 5 seconds - and instead YOU make a damned video that is over a minute. Think of the 'reader' and NOT your 'creativity' - TEXT for articles.
10 | Ben Win | 10154000738965950_10154001718415950 | This was done by Russia because thanks to the big MOUTH of our government and media they told the United States was getting ready to cyberattack Russians sites.
11 | Michael McGan | 10154000738965950_10154000928900950 | Let me guess, it's Russia... (eye roll) Maybe it's because OBAMA turned over control of the internet to the UN.
12 | Melissa Jo Walker | 10154000738965950_10154000770955950 | Hillary has a beautiful smile and a boisterous laugh, that I will say. But when a presidential candidate is accused of serious crimes against the laws regulating the office of Secretary of State of the United States of America,and other very serious matters, it is no laughing matter. Hillary Clinton was confronted by Donald Trump on national television about very serious crimes regarding perjury, obstruction of justice, and treason. She did not answer these questions for the American people, instead she laughed at us! The American people have had these same questions since long before Donald Trump entered the race for president. Hillary Clinton has laughed in our faces America! About very serious matters for which we have demanded answers for years now. And the media doesn’t make an issue of her laughing at America!? What a disgrace and a frightening time for American people that someone that we distrust so much has laughed in our faces and tried to destroy the only man who is powerful and wealthy enough to go up against the corruption of the Clinton crime family. From guns and drugs and money laundering in Mena, Arkansas to the present rigging of a presidential election, we have watched a crime family come into power and attempt to control the media and the truth about the direction of our country. We have proof that she has a public policy and a private policy, and so many more secrets. God bless Donald Trump for being our voice and for standing strong against the all out assault on his character as he fights to expose the truth. Democrats and media and many of the establishment Republicans, like the Bush family, should all be ashamed and disgraced for being so anti- American. This is no laughing matter, this is our Republic for which we the people will stand, until death! TRUMP/PENCE 2016 LET’S TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK

Several international arrest warrants out for him in Russia and England.  Why is this media platform reporting THAT??? We all know the TRUTH except for liberals who have their head in a bucket.

You are digging up dirt, FOR THEM, refusing to tell anything ABOUT THEM...  They are, and will be bringing in thousands of refugees (which the taxpayers will have to support).. Some will be our enemy, killing our people..  She put our country in danger, and broke the law, with her e-mails..  She will appoint judges that will make sure, that a baby can be killed, the day BEFORE it is born..  YOU will be a part of destroying America, IF she is elected..  SHAME on all of you..

2 | Jody Guysinger | 10154000612525950_10154000629300950 | Legally, Hillary shouldn't be able to run for president!Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them.

Those of you that refuse to are not doing this country any good. Hillary and Trump leave a lot to be desired but one of them will be president. We need to heal from this election somehow and move forward as one country.  If you can't then you are part of the problem.
7 | Johnny Layne | 10154000612525950_10154000880610950 | Of course this is the stuff that the media does not want to talk about regarding Trump.Subject: Re: A FEW THINGS WE NEED TO KNOW. ABOUT..DONALD TRUMP A FEW THINGS WE NEED TO KNOW. ABOUT..DONALD TRUMP>>                 Trump Does The Unthinkable -Liz Crokin ....>                                 Entertainment columnist for the "Red Eye Edition of the Chicago Tribune" and as a freelancer for "Us Weekly".>>                       In 1986, Trump prevented the foreclosure of Annabell Hill's family farm after her husband committed suicide. Trump personally phoned down to the auction to stop the sale of her home and offered the widow money. Trump decided to take action after he saw Hill's pleas for help in news reports.>>>>                       In 1988, a commercial airline refused to fly Andrew Ten, a sick child with a rare illness, across the country to get medical care because he had to travel with an elaborate life-support system. His grief stricken parents contacted Trump for help and he didn't hesitate to send HIS own plane to take the child from Los Angeles to New York so he could get his treatment.>>>                       In 1991, 200 Marines who served in Operation Desert Storm spent time at Camp Lejeunein,  North Carolina before they were scheduled to return home to their families. However, the Marines were told that a mistake had been made and an aircraft would not be able to take them home on their scheduled departure date. When Trump got wind of this, he sent HIS plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami to safely return the Gulf War Marines to their loved  ones.>>>                       In 1995, a motorist stopped to help Trump after the limo he was traveling in got a flat tire. Trump asked the Good Samaritan how he could repay him for his help. All the man asked for was a bouquet of flowers for his wife. A few weeks later Trump sent the flowers with a note that read: "We've paid off your mortgage.">>>                       In 2000, Maury Povich featured a little girl named Megan who struggled with Brittle Bone Disease on his show and Trump happened to be watching. Trump said the little girl's story and positive attitude touched his heart. So he contacted Maury and gifted the little girl and her family with a very generous check..>>>                       In 2008,after Jennifer Hudson's family members were tragically murdered in Chicago, Trump put the Oscar-winning actress and her family up at his Windy City hotel for free. In addition to that, Trump's security took extra measures to ensure Hudson and her family members were safe during such a difficult time.>>>                       In 2013, New York bus driver Darnell Barton spotted a woman close to the edge of a bridge staring at traffic below as he drove by. He stopped the bus, got out and put his arm around the woman and saved her life by convincing her to not jump. When Trump heard about this story, he sent the hero bus driver a check simply because he believed his good deed deserved to be rewarded.>>>                       In 2014,Trump gave $25,000 to Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi after he spent seven months in a Mexican jail for accidentally crossing the US-Mexico border. President Barack Obama couldn't even be bothered to make one phone call to assist with the United States Marine's release; however, Trump opened his pocketbook to help this serviceman get back on his feet.>>>                       In 2016, Melissa Consin Young attended a Trump rally and tear fully thanked Trump for changing her life. She said she proudly stood on stage with Trump as Miss Wisconsin USA in 2005. However, years later she found herself struggling with an incurable illness and during her darkest days she explained that she received a handwritten letter from Trump telling her she's the "bravest woman, I know." She said the opportunities that she got from Trump and his organizations ultimately provided her Mexican-American son with a full-ride to college.>>>                       Lynne Patton, a black female executive for the Trump Organization, released a statement in 2016 defending her boss against accusations that he's a racist and a bigot. She tearfully revealed how she's struggled with substance abuse and addiction for years. Instead of kicking her to the curb, she said the Trump Organization and his entire family loyally stood by her through "immensely difficult times.">>>                       Trump's kindness knows no bounds and his generosity has and continues to touch the lives of people from every sex, race and religion. When Trump sees someone in need, he wants to help.>>>                       Two decades ago, Oprah asked Trump in a TV interview if he'd run for president. He said: "If it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what's happening with this country." That day has come. Trump sees that America is in need and he wants to help- how unthinkable!>                                 Donald Trump is a racist, bigot, sexist, xenophobe and Islamophobe --did I miss anything? The left and the media launch these hideous kinds of attacks at Trump everyday; yet, nothing could be further from the truth about the real estate mogul. As an entertainment journalist, I've had the opportunity to cover Trump for over a decade, and in all my years covering him I've never heard anything negative about the man until he announced he was running for president. Keep in mind, I got paid a lot of money to dig up dirt on celebrities like Trump for a living so a scandalous story on the famous billionaire could've potentially sold a lot of magazines and would've been a "huge" feather in my cap. Instead, I found that he doesn't drink alcohol or do drugs, he's a hard working businessman and totally devoted to his beloved wife and children. On top of that, he's one of the most generous celebrities in the world with a heart filled with more gold than his $100 million New York penthouse.>>                       "EVIL SUCCEEDS WHEN GOOD PEOPLE STAND BY AND DO NOTHING!">>                       "Silence makes cowards out of the best of men."--Abraham Lincoln.>>                       SILENCE IS CONSENT......

You know, issues that will affect Americans  depending on who we elect? Foreign policy - National Security and how well they've  been handled in the last 8 years - Our economic status, the GDP at a barely sustainable 1% or our recovery, the worst since 1949 - divisivness like never before - national debt at $20 TRILLION - Yada yada yada!!! YIKES☆☆The McCarthy era was nothing compared to this. Our entertainment and news media use propaganda and are promoting trivial baloney to cover up the big issues affecting America. It's getting very old.  Shockingly, the mainstream entertainment and news media is right there in bed with the rest of the crooks. Your propaganda has made it possible for this to go on for so long.

18 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154000612525950_10154000616040950 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses –from racist slander to misogynistic taunts– is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump’s platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump’s global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States’ responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US’ withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump’s foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight –perceived or real– Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump’s eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot –and that’s just his “fellow” Republicans.He isn’t eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn’t have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party’s elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, “America is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.” De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.1st DEBATE ~ EPIC FAILURE ON DONALD TRUMP’S PART!  AND THIS GUY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT???  I DON’T THINK SO!  HILLARY CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE, HANDS DOWN!!!2ND DEBATE ~ WOO, WHAT A DISASTER.  TRUMP STALKED HILLARY ON STAGE AND WAS OUT OF CONTROL.  NEEDS TO PUT DOWN HE CRACK PIPE FOR AWHILE.  HILLARY WINS THIS ONE TOO.3RD AND FINAL DEBATE.  IS TRUMP OFF HIS MEDS?  TRUMP IS THE KNOWS NOTHING CANDIDATE.  THE ONLY THING HE KNOWS, IS HOW TO LIE.  HE DOES THAT QUITE WELL.  THIS IS A SICK MAN.  HILLARY TAKES ALL.#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence

20 | Tom Lacerte | 10154000612525950_10154000775195950 | The news media knows every little detail of Trump's campaign. But, they haven't found out what Clinton Foundation donors got special favors from the State Department while Hilary Clinton was Secretary of State.
21 | Joseph Pede | 10154000612525950_10154000776725950 | WikiLeaks Bombshell: ‘There Is No US Election’POLITICSOctober 21, 2016WikiLeaks couldn’t have made it clearer in a series of tweets on Thursday – the US election for the President of the United States is rigged. The establishment have selected their President and by hook or crook she will be “elected.”Responding to allegations that WikiLeaks recent leaks have outed it as playing partisan politics, WikiLeaks fired back, “You are not a fan of publishing true information about corrupt ruling power factions who will take power on Jan 20?”There is no US election. There is power consolidation. Rigged primary, rigged media and rigged 'pied piper' candidate drive consolidation.— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 21, 2016On the day WikiLeaks publicized the release of emails from Barack Obama’s personal account, their Twitter account then stated that the outcome of the election was planned from the outset: “What election? It has been clear from the beginning who is going to win. This is, in effect, a power consolidation exercise.”Considering what we now know about the behind-the-scenes rigging of the Democratic primary, the collusion between the DNC establishment and mainstream media, and the fact Hillary Clinton pushed for Donald Trump’s GOP nomination, can you possibly disagree?Are Presidents elected or selected?WikiLeaks emails from Barack Obama’s personal email account reveal that the Bush administration contacted the future president multiple times before the election, secretly organizing the transition of power.The 2008 transition had gone down in history as surprisingly smooth. Martha Joynt Kumar, in a book about the transition, said it “was the best in anyone’s memory, in part because 9/11 made everyone recognize that a transition is fragile time.”Today’s revelations raise questions about why it was so smooth — suggestions Obama was selected by the shadow government, rather than elected by the people, are no longer tinfoil hat territory.The most eye catching email in today’s leak contains a message from John Podesta about an invitation from President George W. Bush to the “President-Elect.”Should that have read “President-Select?” Podesta sent the email to Obama before the election result was known.But it gets even worse.The emails show a transition plan was being worked on long before the 2008 election had taken place. According to an attached memo in one of the emails, Obama was already discussing his transition to office with members of the Bush Administration, including then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, prior to the election.“As you have observed in your interactions with Secretary Paulson, he is apparently eager to involve you and your transition team extensively in his policy choices following the election.“Another attached memo acknowledges that it was unusual to start the transition process so soon.“We are now at the point of deciding how to staff economic policy during the transition, who should be the point of contact with Treasury and how to blend the transition and campaign economic policy talent.Normally these decisions could be made after the election, and ideally after the selection of a National Economic Advisor, but, of course, these are not normal times.“Not normal times? Perhaps not in 2008. But eight years later, it seems nothing has changed. What was “not normal” in 2008 has become very much the norm in 2016.Thanks to WikiLeaks and the unprecedented peek behind the curtains of power they have granted us, the shadow government has been exposed to the light. 2008 wasn’t a smooth transition of power, it was silky smooth power consolidation.WikiLeaks’ variety of journalism – cold, hard, pristine truth – has more than ruffled feathers. The entire henhouse has gone mad. The ruling party are slavering at the mouth, and mainstream media has never been so easy to see through.Watch CNN’s Scott Cuomo, the same guy caught lying to Americans about their First Amendment rights, put himself in the running for a Razzie Award after the network pulled an interview with Rep. Chris Collins as soon as he mentioned WikiLeaks.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agm0hFKSdUwCNN cuts interview feed after Wikileaks is meCNN cuts interview feed after Wikileaks is me

25 | Joe Wilson | 10154000612525950_10154000779575950 | If you vote Hilary this is what she's going to doHillary Clinton stated, "An unborn child has no constitutional rights". In her support of partial birth abortion, I thought I would share the horror of it all. This is the woman, "Hillary" that some will vote for! Brenda Pratt Shafer, a registered nurse from Dayton, Ohio, assisted Dr. Haskell in a Partial Birth Abortion on a 26-1/2 week (over 6 months) pre-born baby boy. She testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. According to nurse Shafer, the baby was alive and moving as the abortionist “delivered the baby’s body and arms - everything but the head. The doctor kept the baby’s head just inside the uterus. The baby’s little fingers were clasping and unclasping, his feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the scissors through the back of his head, and the baby’s arms jerked out in a flinch, a startle reaction, like a baby does when he thinks he might fall. The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction tube into the opening and sucked the baby’s brains out. Now the baby was completely limp.” With forceps, the doctor turns the baby around in the womb to be positioned feet first. The baby’s legs are pulled out into the birth canal. The baby is alive at this point. The abortionist delivers the baby’s entire body, except for the head, which remains inside the birth canal. The baby’s hands and feet move. The abortionist stabs the scissors into the base of the baby’s skull. The scissors are spread to enlarge the opening. The suction catheter is then inserted and the brains are sucked out, causing the skull to collapse. The head slides out easily. Stop this insanity!https://m.facebook.com/story.php...Share this post so everyone knows she's nothing but a murder if you still vote Hilary as President you should have this done to you instead of an innocent life
