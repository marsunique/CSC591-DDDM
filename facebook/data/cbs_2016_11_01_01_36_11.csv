Fellow students, along with a parent in Arizona who overheard a Skype conversation, tipped authorities off to the alleged plot, police say.

A man on a tour said he was trying to impress some girls by sneaking in to the sleeping panda's enclosure.

1 | Sarah Proudfit | 5 | 10154032600835950_10154032628330950 | Ok.Ladies and Gents.No one is impressed by anyone sneaking into any sort of enclosure to pat, fight, poke, or otherwise annoy the predator, bull, ram, or really any sort of creature that someone thought best to enclose. Especially not if the creature in question is endangered. I repeat, No One Will Be Impressed. Mostly they will be sympathetic to the creature. And your stupidity might get the innocent animal killed just because they may rightly want to rip your throat open. Don't Do This.  /endPSA

9 | Tom Sander | 0 | 10154032579520950_10154032709175950 | FBI Director Comey, and the DOJ, in all likelihood could only convict Crooked Hillary in the Court of Public Opinion and therefore have her sentenced by the voters to be prohibited from taking over the White House, i.e., lose the election. This may not have been his purpose, but the destruction of the Clinton Cartel is the outcome never the less. Justice will have been served, albeit Street Justice.The FBI and DOJ (if DOJ would do its job) will easily get multiple indictments against the Clintons and their co-conspirators. However, a criminal conviction(s) is/are improbable given the fact that it only takes one Not Guilty vote out of 12 jurors to get a hung jury and maybe a retrial, e.g., O J Simpson. The Clintons will have access to a billion dollar defense team who will insure the jury is composed of 40-60% (4-7 of the 12) libtards (the same idiots who voted for her--her peers), and they only need to convince one to vote for acquittal. (Most potential GOP jury members will be challenged for cause because they can not be fair and impartial, and because they are smart enough to know how to get out of jury duty--this trial could last many months or even years.) Beyond A Reasonable Doubt is the standard for Criminal Convictions and I find it very hard to believe it could ever happen to the Clintons.A Civil Conviction(s) (More Likely Than Not standard) is possible, but again the jury will be stacked against the prosecution by Clintons' billion dollar defense team. If Ms Lynch is still the DOJ Chief (AG), she will not put her best people on the case to represent the people/USA. It only takes one No Vote to acquit (out of six jurors). (Expect to see many civil suits brought against the Clintons--perhaps they'll lose some of them and Justice will prevail again.)Millions of tax dollars will be spent on investigations, trials, etc., only to result in the Clintons getting by with criminal activity once more.When Trump gets elected, he will hopefully put a stop to the despicable activity of both parties and their minions for at least the next 4-8 years. After that, we'll have to elect pols who put the country and its people first. (Wishful thinking on my part!?!)P.S. One point not mentioned is the possibility of 650,000 e-mails on one computer being a CYA (cover your arse) file. Most folks who ever worked in the DC arena know full well that folks will throw you to the wolves in a NY second. If you want a friend in DC, get a dog. Etc. The Clintons especially are prone to such activities/tactics. Folks like Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin are smart enough to know this, and I suspect this was/is their insurance policy to Get Out of Jail Free and/or to get Reduced Sentence(s) for Cooperation.

14 | Donnie Conley | 5 | 10154032579520950_10154032585985950 | ASSANGE JUST LEAKED PROOF IMPLICATING HILLARY CLINTON IN THE MURDER OF DNC WHISTLEBLOWER SETH RICHELDER PATRIOT ‚Äì The unexplained murder of DNC Voter Expansion Data Director, Seth Rich has troubled many of us who believe Hillary Clinton ordered the ‚Äúhit‚Äù on him.This is not an irresponsible suggestion made in the heat of an election. The man who served as the Chief Investigative Counsel for the House Judiciary Committee‚Äôs investigation and who oversaw the collection of more than 60,000 pages of evidence and hundreds of hours of video interviews while preparing the case for impeachment against Bill Clinton, David Shippers, knows the Clintons‚Äô criminal record as well as anyone and he open admits that he‚Äôs ‚Äúterrified‚Äù of Hillary.Aaron Klein asked Shippers on his investigation talk radio program, ‚ÄúAre you saying, if I am hearing you correctly, that there are legitimate questions that you believe should be asked about the deaths surrounding the Clintons, like Vince Foster and others?‚ÄùShippers replied without hesitating. ‚ÄúAbsolutely. Absolutely.‚ÄùSchippers went so far as to say, ‚ÄúWe know that there were people who disappeared.‚ÄùWhen Rich was found shot in the back his watch, wallet and money, and his cell phone were still on his person.Shortly afterwards, Julian Assange offered a $20,000 reward for anyone who came forward with information that led to the arrest of Seth Rich‚Äôs murderer. When pressed, Assange would no confirm that Rich worked with or for Wikileaks but did say:‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs potentially connected to our publication, and that person has been murdered in suspicious circumstances, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the two are connected. But it is a very serious matter. That type of allegation is very serious, and it‚Äôs taken very seriously by us.‚ÄùAssange‚Äôs concern, of course, is that other contributors to Wikileaks would be dissuaded from continuing their work of providing much needed transparency to a government that has grown out of control out of fear for their lives.Now, the latest Wikileaks release contains an email from Clinton‚Äôs campaign chief John Podesta that virtually proves Hillary‚Äôs involvement:Podesta‚Äôs email confirms that Assange was indeed correct to believe that Hillary ordered Rich‚Äôs murder if for no other reason than to ‚Äúmake an example‚Äù of him in order to deter future leakers.The Clintons operate just like every other crime syndicate.  Those who seek to expose the Clintons‚Äô criminal behavior do so at their own peril.  We have David Shippers‚Äô word on that.If we are to return any form of checks and balances to our political system it is now up to the voters to do their job and finally retire Hillary and the entire Clinton crime family.  It‚Äôs abundantly clear no one in government has the cojones to stand up the Hillary.  If we don‚Äôt vote for someone else, anyone else, the Clinton body count is sure to mount.

If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.   xcvbnm

Number of young children hospitalized for overdosing on opioid painkillers nearly tripled in recent years.

2 | Bobbie Byers-Rios | 3 | 10154032542305950_10154032626435950 | Should have had a bag of weed laying around instead of the pills. They would have thought it was a bag of grass instead of candy. They wouldn't have ate it because it's too dry. Plants over pills!
3 | Maria Resendes | 2 | 10154032542305950_10154032569090950 | Parents are so irresponsible it's unbelievable, between leaving Opioid and guns around the children are suffering the consequences.
4 | Jeff Clark | 4 | 10154032542305950_10154032551055950 | the insurance industry would rather treat the symptoms rather than the cause of one's pain... it's cheaper, and short term-because the person will die sooner than if the person had proper care to cure the pain cause...

9 | Tom Stowe | 2 | 10154032542305950_10154032613815950 | Opiate Medications have been around for a very very long time, at least from what I have garnered from the history of opium. If people are being irresponsible with their medication, or abusing the drugs, it is not that opioids themselves are bad, it is the behavior of the irresponsible or abuser that is bad. I am only speaking for myself based on my experience with opioid painkillers for chronic pain, and I am here to testify that after the correct opioid for me was found after a six year trial period of various meds,  Oxycodone (generic Percocet) lessened my moderate to severe pain and allowed me to sleep sounder and for a longer duration, but in my opinion when the DEA, FDA, CDC, or who ever began the Prescription Opioid War, they have done great harm to those who depended on these medications to allow them less suffering of chronic pain syndromes that can't be fixed with surgeries or other procedures. I was kicked off my oxycodone for No reason other than the doctor who replaced my retiring doctor did not believe in it. That decision has caused a lot of physical pain for me, as OTC medications do not cut the pain. We can continue to blame the opioid medication and go on making legit chronic pain patients suffer, but until someone figures out why so many people are trying to escape their reality, then you will not stop the so-called opioid epidemic by taking away the prescription pain meds, they will only continue to hurt those in need of these medications, and those looking to escape reality will just find another means to do so. If you need these prescription opioid meds, be responsible to keep them from getting into the wrong hands to stop the overdoses.

14 | Collin Hennessy | 0 | 10154032542305950_10154032704405950 | Just give all pain patients IV or IM versions of the drugs.  That will stop most teens from stealing them and experimenting, will prevent children from ingesting them, and will ensure that only people with legit pain issues are willing to accept them.

No charges have been filed after a 59-year-old allegedly assaulted an autistic, non-verbal cross country runner after mistaking the boy for a mugger.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Steve Mestayer | 31 | 10154032456005950_10154032470270950 | Good thing racism is a thing of the past.   I'm sure the 59 year old guy would claim not to be a racist,  but if you immediately think a black male running down the street is a mugger all evidence points to the opposite.   Call it systemic racism if you want, but it's still racism.
2 | Ebony Gordon | 6 | 10154032456005950_10154032557730950 | Smh people are actually defending this man but I'm not surprise at all.Even if he thought he was going get robbed he had no right putting his hands on him.Im sure if it was the other way around the teen would of got charged.
3 | Harry Gill | 9 | 10154032456005950_10154032488660950 | The media at its finest...let's widen that racial gap and inflame tempers! Won't know EXACTLY why until we beat it out of the asshats that attacked him! So media; at least wait until we ALL know for sure THAT was the reason. Don't burn the f'n country down until the jackasses have been convicted at LEAST
4 | James Hanks | 9 | 10154032456005950_10154032488900950 | Still trying to figure out what race has to do with this? Dude that acted a fool, should  be charged with something though. Just don;t see it as a race issue. Just a moron issue.
5 | Benjamin Smith | 3 | 10154032456005950_10154032492835950 | Probably should accompany your non verbal handicap son instead of letting him run around random neighborhoods!  I would assume this guy said something and without a response or even acknowledgment anyone would seem suspicious!
6 | Clayton Christy Mount | 1 | 10154032456005950_10154032549420950 | It's always going to be about race when you put them up against one another but when you put the same race together and shit happens then there's nothing more to the story then your average asshole being an asshole...

‚ÄúI feel [Hillary Clinton‚Äôs] a cookie cutter of the Obama administration. And it‚Äôs not working for middle class, working Americans.‚Äù
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Joseph Kasak | 182 | 10154032357265950_10154032370760950 | I feel like the workers of a Dying industry are not an accurate representation of Middle America as a whole... especially when said dying industry is isolated to a few regions
2 | Jaime Vincent | 150 | 10154032357265950_10154032372610950 | But Trump grew up "rich" and is a celebrity "billionaire". I don't understand why middle class folks, would think he is one of them. He hasn't ever volunteered or held public office, not even school board. I don't get it...not to say Hillary really understands rural PA needs either. But Trump being some sort of savior is an odd choice.
3 | Bryan Skyberg | 108 | 10154032357265950_10154032370365950 | What do these miners want. They need to face the reality. The coal industry is dead. Nothing runs on coal anymore. Trump not going to save their jobs. Nobody can. They need to face the reality of it
4 | Irene Aguirre-Glickman | 39 | 10154032357265950_10154032384135950 | Well just WAIT until Trump gets his little hands on OUR government's money. He won't think about nobody else BUT HIMSELF.  Look what He did with his father's inheritance and his grand nephew who was born a sickly child. His own blood he betrayed!!!
5 | Linda Weaber | 38 | 10154032357265950_10154032396470950 | I really feel sorry for all the coal mining community that believes that Donald Trump is going to bring back their industry. It is a dying industry and unfortunately neither of these candidates can bring it back. But at least Hillary is honest about it's decline.
6 | Sharon Reddick Wooten | 25 | 10154032357265950_10154032441230950 | These people always want to blame the Obama Administration. If The Republican Congress pass some of his Bills this Country would have been in a much better state. Blame your Republican Congress with their Prejudices!
7 | Hylton Josephs | 21 | 10154032357265950_10154032388535950 | Well if they are stupid enough to vote for Trump they are free to do whatever they want. but must reminded they are putting their children'future in the hands of a lunatic.
8 | James Alan Jones | 10 | 10154032357265950_10154032491390950 | Yeah...if I was a coal miner or a tobacco farmer or some other dying industry I would be for Trump too. Democrats are the only hope these people have for retraining and job placement but you can never convince them of that...they have voted GOP all their lives and that is why they still have black lung and live in trailers.
9 | Peter Rodriguez | 4 | 10154032357265950_10154032581210950 | Million of jobs added since the Horrible bush administration. I hope Hillary will be just as good for the economy as Obama was. And my house doubled in value! Hillary 2016!!! (Btw, Trump is an idiot, yes this bad hombre said it!)....
10 | Carl Carlito Nelson | 6 | 10154032357265950_10154032365420950 | I think the way the establishment is out of touch with reality and buddy-buddy with Wall Street and the military and intelligence industrial complex, is the scariest thing we've faced as a modern nation.
11 | Betty Pittman Rowe | 9 | 10154032357265950_10154032372865950 | ...and you think Donald Trump gives a care about the average American? If the USA had a wall around it,I'd say..."go for it"....let's see how that works for you now! LOL
12 | Folasad√© Aderibigbe | 4 | 10154032357265950_10154032406565950 | They ought to blame those big companies for outsourcing their labor and technology companies for making those jobs easier with machince that replace 100 workers. You can't blame that on immigrants and democrats. Also, most young people do not want to work in a factory or run a family business anymore. They want an affordable education so they can get the jobs and salaries their parents never had.
13 | Ryan Sallaway | 3 | 10154032357265950_10154032486115950 | Big Wheel bicycle manufacturers for Trump! Recognize that your industry isn't coming back to its former level of necessity and dominance in the energy market. Sorry, some jobs have to die...and will as we make the transition to more sustainable and healthier forms of energy. Adapt.
14 | Alicia Namoi McGraw | 5 | 10154032357265950_10154032390350950 | Coal is a dying industry. You never put all your eggs in one basket. Trump is not bringing coal jobs back. Even if elected if all you have to offer is skills digging up coal well too bad because I don't see a run on that toy of job but In and Out Burgers is expanding.
15 | CeCe Watson | 2 | 10154032357265950_10154032411060950 | Yikes! This pic made my heart stop. Super dangerous. In today's news, 33 Chinese miners were trapped. Why won't these folks find another job that doesn't require them the meander beneath the earth. Besides, they should take heed of the health issues and environmental concerns if they wish to better enjoy their lives. Personally, I would be one worried wife.
16 | Christal Elerick-Miller | 3 | 10154032357265950_10154032392095950 | Growing up in a heavy coal area,  let me tell you Walmart jobs do not replace coal jobs. The current administration has ignored the job loss in the field. Now they want unions to force a clinton vote?  No way!!!
17 | Scott King Crandall | 22 | 10154032357265950_10154032358190950 | I no longer care about Trump, or his endless lies. Stop giving him free air time, and cover Standing Rock. Shame on you for ignoring the biggest Civil Rights violations since Mayer Daley and the 1968 Chicago Police Department.
18 | James Nelson | 4 | 10154032357265950_10154032368430950 | STEP 1)    Poisoning the wellPoisoning the well (or attempting to poison the well) is a fallacy where irrelevant adverse information about a target is preemptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that the target person is about to say. Poisoning the well can take the form of an (explicit or implied) argument, and is considered by some philosophers an informal fallacy.A poisoned-well "argument" has the following form:1. Unfavorable information (Hillary‚Äôs emails) (be it true or false) about person A (Hillary)is presented by another (Comey & the GOP). (e.g. "Before you listen to my opponent, may I remind you that he has been in jail")2. Therefore, the claims made by person A will be false. I have seen this tactic used by American lawyers many times in my career.  During or just before a big case is to be made the attorneys will poison the well against their opponents merely to discredit them.However, there is never any thought about defending the false allegations in the court of law; only in the court of public opinion.Don‚Äôt be fooled!!!
19 | Dee Nunnery | 0 | 10154032357265950_10154032708705950 | I was born and raised in West Virginia  my dad grandpa and uncle all worked in the mines and they died doing it! People vote for who will make sure your are not transparent so you can survive! I'm with hillary just don't think Trump will do anything for people! I live in Tenn and bush really put us in a bad place I will not vote Republican they are out for themselves and forget everyone else!
20 | Dustin Campbell | 0 | 10154032357265950_10154032529240950 | Democrats don't give a rats ass about these Americans. They don't vote blue, therefore expendable. "Just learn a new trade" yea I'm sure thats cheap and has shovel ready jobs on hand for all of them. "We are gonna need you to stop working and go to school for years to learn solar that we are hoping has a future. We will worry about giving u jobs later to feed your families"
21 | Patricia Kennealy-Morrison | 0 | 10154032357265950_10154032773920950 | They don't seem to realize that Trump is not now, never has been, and never will be their friend. These are hateful sexist racist people, and they have finally found someone who makes it okay to come out and be that way. Their orange pinheaded buffoon of a leader does not have their best interests in mind and has made his blood money by sucking the blood of working-class people like them. But they just don't see it.
22 | Rodney Nursoo | 0 | 10154032357265950_10154032589375950 | Dickheads have been underground to long. America you know this man he the plumber who took your money before doing the job and never returned. America you know this man he the guy who says that he fix everything and does nothing. America you know this man he the dodge use car salesman who told you that your getting a steal of a deal and turns out you got a lemon. America you know this man he a con artists I'm not American and i can see that. Wtf wrong with the middle of America media dumb them out to much now you got nitty wittys everywhere.
23 | Trevor Houghton | 1 | 10154032357265950_10154032603365950 | I wish we had spent a lot more time this election figuring out why working-class people think Republicans have their best interests in mind. There's no such thing as clean coal, and coal mining is not coming back. Kinda like manufacturing. Trump says he'll bring back manufacturing (he can't) and engage in trade wars.  I guess those words are enough for some people. Other aspects of his economic platform seem pretty thin on job creation and pretty big on tax cuts for the rich and corporations.
24 | William Morfeld | 0 | 10154032357265950_10154032450820950 | Coal still produces more energy in the world than any other source. Until there is a viable alternative it will stay. Other countries have tried to switch over to nothing but renewable energy and it did not end well. Look up energy poverty it is a very well documented failure. Do we need to look at other forms of energy hell yes we do we can't go on like this forever. But and it's a big but the alternative needs to be able to replace it all in all the countries and that will not happen due to costs. China is putting coal fires plants online at a record pace despite what our administration says. Even if the coal is not burned in the US it is still being shipped over seas millions of tons at a time. Not to mention people sure love their steel for building and cars guess what that's all metallurgical coal that those plants burn. Is Trump the savior? Not a chance but after the last couple election cycles of democrats in office the country is all but at war with itself. So time to change something anything to do nothing and expect different results is idiotic.
25 | John Meadows | 0 | 10154032357265950_10154032541125950 | Of course they are. Their livelihood is disappearing. What we need to do is train these people to build windmills and solar panels. This is a dying industry because it's filthy and destructive and full of medical problems.

Peter Thiel's unabashed support of Donald J. Trump has stoked some serious controversy among his Silicon Valley peers.
--------------Comments:--------------

2 | William J Smith Jr. | 20 | 10154032275575950_10154032368275950 | I just early voted for Donald J Trump. I am sick of both parties and their elitists. It's time for new leadership. DRAIN THE SWAMP.
3 | Tammy Pepper- Febry | 6 | 10154032275575950_10154032444050950 | ‚ö†If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ VOTE TRUMP!!!

12 | Christian Torres | 0 | 10154032275575950_10154032779270950 | Trump is a pathetic,desperate pathological liar who will throw his red meat out there and see who will eat it up...now you see why he said, "I love stupid people, they will believe anything I say."and "stupid people love me. " How is it Presidential to incite hatred, violence, fighting, and even murder: If any people have not figured out that Trump is a lying fraud by now... they are either complete morons or racists who just like his nasty attacks and feeling they have a voice.

15 | Henrik Ahlm | 0 | 10154032275575950_10154032623225950 | Why vote Clinton and not Trump?It is one of the most simple questions to answer if you got a normal functioning brain.Like the editorial board of one of the world's most respected business newspapers said today:"Mrs Clinton carries enough baggage to fill a Boeing 747. She is not trusted by the majority of voters. But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US. Period!Nobody, who loves America, wants a President, who secretly enjoys a sexsual relationship with Putin. Putin - the serious rumour says - makes Trump crawl on the floor while Putin whips Trumps hairdue with a goosefeather all the while Trump beggs for mercy and cries out loud. The rumour also has it that a certain gay speculator from Silicon Valley likes to join in.And U.S. gun owners - men in black are back on Election day!

18 | Donnie Conley | 1 | 10154032275575950_10154032483185950 | ASSANGE JUST LEAKED PROOF IMPLICATING HILLARY CLINTON IN THE MURDER OF DNC WHISTLEBLOWER SETH RICHELDER PATRIOT ‚Äì The unexplained murder of DNC Voter Expansion Data Director, Seth Rich has troubled many of us who believe Hillary Clinton ordered the ‚Äúhit‚Äù on him.This is not an irresponsible suggestion made in the heat of an election. The man who served as the Chief Investigative Counsel for the House Judiciary Committee‚Äôs investigation and who oversaw the collection of more than 60,000 pages of evidence and hundreds of hours of video interviews while preparing the case for impeachment against Bill Clinton, David Shippers, knows the Clintons‚Äô criminal record as well as anyone and he open admits that he‚Äôs ‚Äúterrified‚Äù of Hillary.Aaron Klein asked Shippers on his investigation talk radio program, ‚ÄúAre you saying, if I am hearing you correctly, that there are legitimate questions that you believe should be asked about the deaths surrounding the Clintons, like Vince Foster and others?‚ÄùShippers replied without hesitating. ‚ÄúAbsolutely. Absolutely.‚ÄùSchippers went so far as to say, ‚ÄúWe know that there were people who disappeared.‚ÄùWhen Rich was found shot in the back his watch, wallet and money, and his cell phone were still on his person.Shortly afterwards, Julian Assange offered a $20,000 reward for anyone who came forward with information that led to the arrest of Seth Rich‚Äôs murderer. When pressed, Assange would no confirm that Rich worked with or for Wikileaks but did say:‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs potentially connected to our publication, and that person has been murdered in suspicious circumstances, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the two are connected. But it is a very serious matter. That type of allegation is very serious, and it‚Äôs taken very seriously by us.‚ÄùAssange‚Äôs concern, of course, is that other contributors to Wikileaks would be dissuaded from continuing their work of providing much needed transparency to a government that has grown out of control out of fear for their lives.Now, the latest Wikileaks release contains an email from Clinton‚Äôs campaign chief John Podesta that virtually proves Hillary‚Äôs involvement:Podesta‚Äôs email confirms that Assange was indeed correct to believe that Hillary ordered Rich‚Äôs murder if for no other reason than to ‚Äúmake an example‚Äù of him in order to deter future leakers.The Clintons operate just like every other crime syndicate.  Those who seek to expose the Clintons‚Äô criminal behavior do so at their own peril.  We have David Shippers‚Äô word on that.If we are to return any form of checks and balances to our political system it is now up to the voters to do their job and finally retire Hillary and the entire Clinton crime family.  It‚Äôs abundantly clear no one in government has the cojones to stand up the Hillary.  If we don‚Äôt vote for someone else, anyone else, the Clinton body count is sure to mount.

5 | Laura McPherson | 38 | 10154032200740950_10154032225405950 | kudos to the employee. He was doing the right thing. He was at his job. He deserve a raise.
6 | Bill Bomberry | 19 | 10154032200740950_10154032227855950 | I know someone who was a Chicago Police Officer for years. He never used his weapon. He was bored in retirement so he became a bank guard. Someone tried to rob the bank and he shot and killed the robber. He quit the job after that. Wasn't worth it. Killing a robber over money at a pizza place? Justified or not, hopefully the shooter will successfully deal with taking a human life.
7 | Teresa McClelland Jeffries | 12 | 10154032200740950_10154032249235950 | Lee Lewis that moron would probably have been killed by that someone's son or dad that was robbing the place with a gun! That son or dad was a criminal and got what they deserved. Too bad he didn't get the other two. This man is a hero. He saved his own life and the life of the other employees.  Insurance won't replace the employees life!
8 | Erik Carvajal | 8 | 10154032200740950_10154032269625950 | Whose to say that the robbers wouldn't have harmed anyone, people sit there on there computer chairs and say it wasn't necessary. I always like to think of it as if my wife or child or mother were in that situation. Would I want someone who could make a difference to "wait and see what happens?" And then the robbers get as much support as the guy that may have saved many lives by  acting. Amazing......smh
9 | Lee Lewis | 7 | 10154032200740950_10154032232590950 | Let them take the money, this is why places pay for insurance. That moron killed someone's son or dad.. over a few dollars, and people are praising him for it.. this world is sick and ignorant!

BARAK OBAMA has been her boss giving orders that caused her to have to plead the 5th. ONLY LOTETTA LYNCH  can form a GRAND JURY and  her instructions directed JAMES COMEY to stop the investigation of HILLARY CLINTONS EMAILS. DONNA BRAZILE-Dozens of times stated she did not feed questions into to the CLINTON campaign. CNN has fired her and denounced her actions. MEGYN KELLY made DONNA BRAZILE claim she was being attacked and she still denied feeding questions to the Clinton campaign. Wiki Leaks proved her a LIAR.HUMA ABEDIN-married ANTHONY WEINER and has over 1/2 million emails on a shared computer that is being investigated by the FBI. Huma also pleaded the 5th to CONGRESS. SHE is the direct spokes person for HILLARY CLINTON and HILLARY CLINTONS close friend and aide. Helped CLINTON find people to delete emails. Wiki Leaks proved her a LIAR.DEBBIE WASSERMAN-SCHULZ was DEMOCRATIC NATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN and close friend to HILLARY CLINTON. SHE helped the DEMOCRATIC PARTY to rig the DEMOCRATIC PARTY PRIMARIES so BERNIE SANDERS had very little chance to be nominated for the DEMOCRATIC PARTY CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE USA. Wiki Leaks proved her a LIAR.NOW I CAN GO ON FOR PAGES UPON PAGES OF THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY OF THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE USA-HILLARY CLINTON. BUT IT WOULD STILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO GET REAL DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS AND VOTERS TO ABANDON HER IN THIS ELECTION. She did not delete emails. She never ever did one improper thing in her 36 year career. Media has never, ever given her preferential treatment. She has never taken money from coutries with connections to terrorists, or that subjugate women or gays. She would never call US citizens deploreable or stupid. She has never made a incorrect decision in her life...not about BEHGHAZI, NOT ABOUT HER PERSONAL EMAIL SERVER, NOT ABOUT PLEADING THE 5TH.  GIVE EVERYONE A BREAK. LIES ARE LIES. Wiki leaks proved her a LIAR.DONALD TRUMP WAS A WOMANIZER...AND CONTINUES TO SAY BAD WORDS. GOSSIP HAS CAUSED HIM MORE TROUBLE IN THIS ELECTION than facts in the wiki leaks, MEDIA CONTINUES TO ATTACK HIM, REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS STILL DO NOT SUPPORT HIM, AND HE CONTINUES SAY THE WORDS THAT CITIZENS WANT TO HEAR...BECAUSE HIS WORDS HAVE PROVEN TRUE. WHILE OTHERS LIE AND DO POLITICALLY CORRECT THINGS...EVEN WHEN MORALLY WRONG. HE WILL NOT CHANGE...THIS IS HIS MOVEMENT, HE BECAME THE LEADER VOTERS RESPECT AND LOVE. THIS IS HIS PLATFORM AND WHEN HIS STANCE IS ATTACKED HE DEFENDS WHAT HE BELIEVES WITH PASSION. HE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BILLIONAIRE...BUT A HUNDRED TIMES MORE IMPORTANT!!SO, I AM TALKING TO INDEPENDENT VOTERS WITH COMMON SENSE...TO JUST GO ON THE DAMN INTERNET...LOOK AT TRUTHS...CHECK YOUR FEELINGS ON WHAT YOU WANT IN AMERICAN POLITICS...because your choices will be AMERICAS future for at least the next 4 years.This deploreable former BERNIE SUPPORTER voter voting DONALD TRUMP. BECAUSE WHEN THIS FORMER WOMANIZER AND BAD WORD DAYER IS COMPARED TO HILLARY CLINTON...he wins in every category that SHOULD ELECT OUR PRESIDENT OF THE USA. Wiki leaks did not find his taxes on the internet...because he is smarter than HILLARY CLINTON.

What did your kid dress up as this Halloween? A pumpkin? A ghost? Boy, bye. Meet little Kylie Rae Brooks. cbsn.ws/2f6soy9
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Missy Guimbellot | 26 | 10154032016675950_10154032055725950 | So dressing children as a singing strippin whore is a thing? Will she be reciting her nasty lyrics as well? Parading her crotch around and humping air as well? Trashy!!
2 | Tim Wenzel | 15 | 10154032016675950_10154032105760950 | Not only dressing your child as her, but encouraging her emulating her should be a chargeable offense. A racist slut as your child's role model, great parenting there.
3 | Juanita Jones Bisig | 5 | 10154032016675950_10154032288880950 | Yeah, she's a great roll model, glorified stripper married to a drug dealer, awesome parenting Diana. And again, thanks CBS News, for the breaking news. Is this supposed to take the spotlight off Killary??
4 | Jessica Leigh | 1 | 10154032016675950_10154032335995950 | Yesss, best costume's for Halloween! Obviously, lil' Bey knows what she is and isn't supposed to do (being that there isn't a picture of her floating around the internet with her middle fingers up), and it probably goes with what she is and isn't supposed to say. Not that her parenting is any of my business. Hopefully this means that she'll grow up to be a strong-willed woman who owns her own body, speaks her mind, and is incredibly famous and fabulously wealthy no matter how many haters there are. <3 You do you, kid!
5 | Melisa Grace | 0 | 10154032016675950_10154032386505950 | There's nothing wrong with this. She's a kid and she's 5. Chances are she doesn't understand the lyrics well and I doubt her mother would let her do anything wrong or bad. She's dressed fine and she looks good. If she wants to dress up as Beyonce that's fine.
6 | Lee Russ | 3 | 10154032016675950_10154032122545950 | So teaching,your kid to act like a white is the new thing. Thank god my kids are grown and have respect for themselves....momma taught them that.
7 | Elle Loy | 15 | 10154032016675950_10154032043645950 | So Wrong!!! Shame in that Mother. You are her Mother not her Friend! Parenting Fail.

14 | True Poizon | 2 | 10154032016675950_10154032086895950 | Hey USA, the world is watching what you do in this election. You have two weirdos running (which begs the question why lol)....but remember this when voting:----Love Clinton all you want....but YOU (yes, you) would be fired from your job and possibly thrown in jail if you did what she did. That right there is enough for me to say No to her. Voting for Clinton is proving that you support corruption, unfairness, and the elite being held to lower standards than the people. Plus, you don't think the GOP will fight non-stop to impeach her----Love Trump all you want. I couldn't care less about his typical jock talk, but imagine if you said those things at work? Fired in 2 seconds lol. I find it strange that Democrats didn't care about Bernie Sanders' rape fantasy book (and I like Bernie), yet they care so much about Trump's words. ----And then what happens after you vote? You think the USA will magically change? I voted for Obama, but the man has done nothing. Minimum wage? Paid leave? Healthcare? Crime? The same. The rich are still richer, poor are still poorer, and unarmed people are getting shot by cops. No change at all. Perhaps a non-politician is what we need, I mean how much worse can it possibly be?
15 | Rob Wade | 1 | 10154032016675950_10154032097545950 | Yep a great role model there if you look up to a racist that whores herself out.

1 | Jim Meiser | 33 | 10154031908540950_10154032127490950 | I'm pro oilfield been doing it all my life  but when a company wants to dig up a grave yard of native Americans I've got a problem with this. Think about it. If it was you're family's final resting place would you want some assholes digging up you're family Graves for a dam pipeline?
2 | Shea Parker | 8 | 10154031908540950_10154032354570950 | Lord, I'm ashamed to be an American. This is one reason are planet is dying. We don't need more pipelines. Our people are dying, and the government doesn't give a shit. As long as their bank accounts are getting full. That's all they care about.
3 | Neftali Herrera | 1 | 10154031908540950_10154032199015950 | Sad thing, the pipe is going to be built, no matter what, the rich don't care about, sacred land, clean water (they drink Evian) what you think, what you want, none of this bullshit, they only care on much cash is coming into their packets, the pipe is getting built!!'

5 | Gary Ford | 3 | 10154031908540950_10154032104040950 | Push their asses out of the way and build the pipeline. I need gas and fuel to workIf you wanna support them,ride your bicycle there and take off from work. Oh that's right,protesters don't work,they protest to tell the rest of us how to think
6 | Myles Manthey | 1 | 10154031908540950_10154032689265950 | I just want this fact to be known. Water is life, some day people will understand, if I lived downstream I'd be raising all kinds of hell too, I wish I could  go there and help because there isn't too many of us Native Americans alive today. What really pisses me off is that this pipeline was going to be going through Bismarck but that is a white majority town and they feared for the safety of their water so the oil company moved it down stream to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation so now when it breaks the white people's water in Bismarck won't be effected by it just the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and and everybody else downstream!
7 | Robert Schmidt | 4 | 10154031908540950_10154031924550950 | Why? They are impeding progress. Native Americans lost the war.

He didn't repeat the oath properly to defend our nation and our Constitution. Later the Democrats claimed he was given the oath again‚Ä¶.in private?CIA director John Brennan took his oath on a copy of the Constitution,~~not a Bible.Congressman, Keith Ellison took his oath on a copy ~~of the Qur'an.Congresswoman Michele Bachman was vilified and almost tarred and feathered by Democrats when she voiced her concern about Muslims taking over our government. Considering all these appointments, it would explain why Obama and his minions are systematically destroying our nation, supporting radical Muslim groups worldwide, opening our southern border, and turning a blind eye to the genocide being perpetrated on Christians all over Africa and the Middle East. The more damage Obama does, the more arrogant he's become! Our nation and our government has been infiltrated by people who want to destroy us. It WILL only get worse.PLEASE COPY AND SHARE,PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THIS,MOST DO NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

James Comey revealed last week that the FBI had discovered new emails that might potentially be related to its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email servers.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Earl Vanover | 41 | 10154031720275950_10154031744470950 | LMAO, SPIN, Spin, spin... How did Hillary respond to email Huma, who was trusted with everything, sent her. 650,000 emails. That is A LOT of history... Hillary will be going down on this one.
2 | Eric Vaughan | 9 | 10154031720275950_10154031740280950 | I wouldn't be surprised if the old boys network in the Democratic Party wanted to sabotage Hillary Clinton because a woman president is the beginning of the end if you're a prominent male politician who likes to behave like a rich drunk in a strip bar, like Donald Trump or Bill Clinton.
3 | Rose Meade | 0 | 10154031720275950_10154032122260950 | Comey clearly violated the Hatch Amendment Act policy, today when he attempted to interfere with the election just 11 days out. When the evidence is connected with the fact that Comey purposely tried to mislead the American people into believing that his investigation iinto Conressman Anthony Weiner was instead a new investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails, it's now clear that he purposely violated the Hatch Amendment of 1993in an attempt to rig the Presidential election. It further raises questions of whether Comey will "END UP IN PRISON" for his crime.
4 | Lucy McAllister | 3 | 10154031720275950_10154031836565950 | CBS move on find another dem candidate, one that the repubs can get behind, who cares, just get over Clinton and find another candidate.... whats wrong you too chicken? Its easier to fight Comey than Clinton isn't it?  Hillary is done.
5 | Ron Evans | 2 | 10154031720275950_10154032000600950 | October 25, 2016A Retired FBI Agent Addresses James Comey on the Hillary Clinton InvestigationBy Hugh GalyenI am writing regarding your public statement in July, 2016 informing the American people that the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton was being closed without referring it to a Federal Grand Jury or the Attorney General of the U. S. for a decision whether or not to indict her. Strangely, you eloquently laid out enough of the evidence deduced from the investigation to strongly indicate there was abundant evidence uncovered during the investigation and interview of her to not only indict but to convict her in  Federal Court.¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠ ¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠However, you personally  re-worded and soft-pedaled the actions she took as Secretary of State describing her actions as "extremely careless‚Äù in using a personal email and un-secured server for her communications while Secretary of State. You rewrote the statute, which is not your job.MS Clinton was not merely careless or extremely careless. She was not even negligent or grossly negligent (as the statute requires). Hillary Clinton was knowingly purposeful in her decisions and actions to set up a server under her exclusive control and possession in order to control what information was available to the American public and Congress regarding her actions as Secretary of State. Furthermore, she took those government owned communications into her personal possession after leaving her position and knowingly and willingly attempted to destroy them so her nefarious actions could never be known or used as evidence of her corrupt moral character against her.Throughout my years with the FBI, I (along with my fellow agents) took great pride in conducting each investigation in an unbiased manner regardless of the subject‚Äôs position or standing in the community.All were treated equally under the law. But you, Sir, decided to allow this corrupt, evil and nasty human being to go free and unchallenged for her treasonous actions (yes, treasonous, in my opinion) which threatened the security of this nation. Furthermore, you stopped short of investigating the Clinton Foundation as a RICO case (Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization.  This is a RICO case ifthere ever were one. Even an untrained person can tell from the communications which were recovered that Hillary Clinton spent more time working for the Clinton Foundation while Secretary of State than on State Business.  It may be argued that Hillary did not do any State business UNLESS the Clinton Foundation benefitted.  You decided to just let this uncomfortable truth alone without addressing it.Read more: http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/10/a_retired_fbi_agent_addresses_james_comey_on_the_hillary_clinton_investigation.html#ixzz4OF8YYxLi

But go ahead and vote for a proven thief liar person causing deaths of innocent people accepter of foreign money under the guise of a foundation among many other things.

15 | Penny Traweek Massey | 1 | 10154031720275950_10154031876320950 | I crack up when I hear their polls. Hillary is always leading. If she has that many supporters where are they?

For What It's Worth Department:                                        The Media just doesn‚Äôt get it....they can't believe that people are so angry     that they can no longer be manipulated!  Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes, he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phony pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and it's going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.
25 | Kenneth Isbell | 0 | 10154031720275950_10154032103960950 | Ok, we now know for certain that CNN fed debate questions to Donna Brazile. Now, are there any FCC rules against this? I know it's totally wrong and unethical, but is it actually illegal? Are there DNC rules against it? Are there rules against a candidate receiving questions before a debate? Do you think Hillary Clinton will even make a statement or explain herself regarding this unethical conduct? I know these are a lot of questions but I feel they are questions that need to be answered.

Truth be told everyone knows he's sick.

Natives Americans were forced off their lands by all, made to live on reservations that do not fall under Federal jurisdiction. Yet the federal government is pushing a pipeline that could be rerouted off Native American land. National Guard and LE have arrested Elders and others. It's not right that this is happening on what land they can call their own.
2 | Brian Parsons | 33 | 10154031629025950_10154031661045950 | I wonder if they will post the story about be dapl security man that had infiltrated within the protectors then took off quickly with his rifle in an attempt to get to the camp grounds. He was captured by the Native American veterans and then arrested by the tribal police. There's actual video evidence of it happening. He's one of the dapl folks that the natives are talking about trying to cause disruptions making it look like the natives are not being peaceful
3 | Laura Dikovsky Smith | 18 | 10154031629025950_10154031721120950 | Oh so you post this? How abt the 15 yo's horse getting shot by rbber bullets while he was on it's back? How abt the gov't getting caught cutting ranchers' fences & blaming it on the #WaterProtectors! Could go on & on! Pathetic!
4 | Xavier Armanno | 4 | 10154031629025950_10154031887605950 | Often (too often IMHO), people take to Facebook to express "solidarity" with a cause, and 99% of the time it's the NIMBY cause de jour (not in my back yard). If you're literally driving or flying to ND and joining the hundreds of people actually camping on the plains in the cold, then you're a better person than I am. If you're outraged about a pipe line that's not even been built yet, because it may or may not someday leak oil, then why not check in to the Niger Delta to highlight the millions of gallons spilled every year? That's rhetorical. The simple answer is; because it's not the cause of the day that also happens to be in your figurative back yard. Consequently, it's not really helping anyone to "check in" to the Standing Rock reservation.
5 | Rosa D'Carta | 19 | 10154031629025950_10154031794100950 | Btw, CBS.. while you're at it, why not tell everyone about this?https://weather.com/news/news/shelby-county-alabama-pipeline-explosion?cm_ven=FB_NEWS_CW_103116_1
6 | Barbara Kantor | 12 | 10154031629025950_10154032024955950 | CBS ~ How about YOU checking in to show solidarity too?What the local and imported police are doing to peaceful water protectors is despicable.
7 | Roseanne Johnson Southard | 0 | 10154031629025950_10154032418085950 | I WONDERED about the "check in."  One moment my Friend was handing out Halloween candy a few blocks from me, the next she was actually in the Dakotas!  Thought maybe it was some kind of "map app."
8 | Carolyn Perry | 2 | 10154031629025950_10154032375130950 | This has got to stop the Indians have more rights then anyone else in this country and they're fighting to keep the water & land from being destroyed more then it already has been
9 | Jacol Casey | 3 | 10154031629025950_10154032300340950 | Karen Jane Byrd it is great you are standing for the natives but it isn't because of their land... or not all of it. They have dug up some sacred buried grounds... the pipe line itself is not the worry it is what if it leaks into the water way. It isn't all about the land. Many pipelines have started leaking. If this pipe line leaks it will contaminate the water ways that supply fresh water to some of the tribal lands and many other people. They are not fighting This battle over the unjust of their lands they are actually fighting this battle for clean water. The native people have took on a battle that affects all of us.  Water is life. They have been protesting calmly with just chants and everything for months now. It is the largest gathering of native people in history. But it will affect more then just them. It doesn't help them to turn this into any race battle and they haven't done that. Right now this is a greed thing. Showing how government corruption and greed is more important then environment and clean water ways. They have even gotten the UN involved. So the fight is good but when you argue with people keep calm and use facts.

1 | Derik Sherman | 0 | 10154031570960950_10154031580805950 | Halloween has been taken so far out of context from its roots of being a Satanic holiday. It's about nightmares coming alive, and scaring the living daylights out of kis. It's not about Tinkerbell and who has the biggest candy hoard.

BARAK OBAMA has been her boss giving orders that caused her to have to plead the 5th. ONLY LOTETTA LYNCH  can form a GRAND JURY and  her instructions directed JAMES COMEY to stop the investigation of HILLARY CLINTONS EMAILS. DONNA BRAZILE-Dozens of times stated she did not feed questions into to the CLINTON campaign. CNN has fired her and denounced her actions. MEGYN KELLY made DONNA BRAZILE claim she was being attacked and she still denied feeding questions to the Clinton campaign. Wiki Leaks proved her a LIAR.HUMA ABEDIN-married ANTHONY WEINER and has over 1/2 million emails on a shared computer that is being investigated by the FBI. Huma also pleaded the 5th to CONGRESS. SHE is the direct spokes person for HILLARY CLINTON and HILLARY CLINTONS close friend and aide. Helped CLINTON find people to delete emails. Wiki Leaks proved her a LIAR.DONNA WASSERMAN-SCHULZ was DEMOCRATIC NATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN and close friend to HILLARY CLINTON. SHE helped the DEMOCRATIC PARTY to rig the DEMOCRATIC PARTY PRIMARIES so BERNIE SANDERS had very little chance to be nominated for the DEMOCRATIC PARTY CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE USA. Wiki Leaks proved her a LIAR.NOW I CAN GO ON FOR PAGES UPON PAGES OF THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY OF THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE USA-HILLARY CLINTON. BUT IT WOULD STILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO GET REAL DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS AND VOTERS TO ABANDON HER IN THIS ELECTION. She did not delete emails. She never ever did one improper thing in her 36 year career. Media has never, ever given her preferential treatment. She has never taken money from coutries with connections to terrorists, or that subjugate women or gays. She would never call US citizens deploreable or stupid. She has never made a incorrect decision in her life...not about BEHGHAZI, NOT ABOUT HER PERSONAL EMAIL SERVER, NOT ABOUT PLEADING THE 5TH.  GIVE EVERYONE A BREAK. LIES ARE LIES. Wiki leaks proved her a LIAR.DONALD TRUMP WAS A WOMANIZER...AND CONTINUES TO SAY BAD WORDS. GOSSIP HAS CAUSED HIM MORE TROUBLE IN THIS ELECTION than facts in the wiki leaks, MEDIA CONTINUES TO ATTACK HIM, REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS STILL DO NOT SUPPORT HIM, AND HE CONTINUES SAY THE WORDS THAT CITIZENS WANT TO HEAR...BECAUSE HIS WORDS HAVE PROVEN TRUE. WHILE OTHERS LIE AND DO POLITICALLY CORRECT THINGS...EVEN WHEN MORALLY WRONG. HE WILL NOT CHANGE...THIS IS HIS MOVEMENT, HE BECAME THE LEADER VOTERS RESPECT AND LOVE. THIS IS HIS PLATFORM AND WHEN HIS STANCE IS ATTACKED HE DEFENDS WHAT HE BELIEVES WITH PASSION. HE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BILLIONAIRE...BUT A HUNDRED TIMES MORE IMPORTANT!!SO, I AM TALKING TO INDEPENDENT VOTERS WITH COMMON SENSE...TO JUST GO ON THE DAMN INTERNET...LOOK AT TRUTHS...CHECK YOUR FEELINGS ON WHAT YOU WANT IN AMERICAN POLITICS...because your choices will be AMERICAS future for at least the next 4 years.This deploreable former BERNIE SUPPORTER voter voting DONALD TRUMP. BECAUSE WHEN THIS FORMER WOMANIZER AND BAD WORD SAYER IS COMPARED TO HILLARY CLINTON...he wins in every category that SHOULD ELECT OUR PRESIDENT OF THE USA. Wiki leaks did not find his taxes on the internet...because he is smarter than HILLARY CLINTON.

Little Kylie Rae Brooks has been listening to Beyonc√© since she was in the womb. So when it came time to choose a Halloween costume this year, reenacting "Lemonade" was the obvious choice.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Charlotte Williams | 22 | 10154031507335950_10154031545875950 | Why would anybody want Beyonc√© to be a role model for their daughter?
