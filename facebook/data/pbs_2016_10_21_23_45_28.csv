Sara Goldrick-Rab describes our student debt crisis: "We have a problem, where people are being priced out of college, and in their effort to not be priced out, they’re taking on debt that, frankly, they’re going to have real trouble repaying."

To secure the presidency, Donald Trump needs 64 more electoral votes than Mitt Romney won in 2012--for example, Florida, Ohio and at least two other states that have drifted toward Clinton.

1 | Kay Calkins | 10154686397188675_10154686539303675 | This is no surprise to me, I have a son who is 43 and he would never vote Republican; so it is not a surprise at all that he is voting for Hilary.  I also have a daughter, 38 who is campaigning for her.  I am 65 and this is just the tip of the iceberg, we raised them right!  I am so proud of them!
2 | Charlotte Jadhav | 10154686397188675_10154686530773675 | Yes, and I hope he loses "bigley" to use one of his words!
3 | Donald Seagraves | 10154686397188675_10154686644023675 | He has to do better than Mitt Romney, but he's much worse than Mitt. He is doing far worse than Romney over so many demographics. He's toast. He's got virtually zero support among minorities. Many of the "safe" red states are suddenly not so safe.
4 | Joseph Frato | 10154686397188675_10154686734338675 | Y'all are crazy. Trump is gonna win BIGLY.

6 | Gary Davies | 10154686397188675_10154686757023675 | Sounds pretty good but it ain't over until it's over. The only poll that counts is the election.

11 | Robert Lee | 10154686397188675_10154686597018675 | Has anyone taken the time to do the math to figure out how much more money they will have in their pocket every pay check if Donald Trump is elected.Example: Trumps Plan                  Hillary Plan$500 Pay Check                 $500 Pay 15%  Tax                              37%  tax__________                          __________$425.00        In your pocket    $315That is an additional $440.00 a month in your pocket.If you make $1,000.00 a week you will have an additional $850.00 a month in your pocket.This is just one example. We will have more jobs with Donald Trump as president. More small businesses opening, Hire paying jobs, better trade deals that brings more money into our country, Less people on welfare, food stamps, better schools, better economy, higher paying jobs, better schools/education, rebuilt instructor, our children will graduate college with available jobs and much less debt, our government will no longer have control over us and the corruption will be stopped. Anyone coming in to the US will be vetted (very important). Better health care, Large companies will come back to the US and provide more jobs. The list goes on.If you want a future for your children.Please get out and vote for Donald Donald J. Trump.Hillary Clinton wants to establish a 65% inheritance tax on the savings and property of every Americans relatives, parents, grandparents or any other relative who "God Bless Them" pass away.  This means she wants the Federal Government to take a one-time grab using the IRS to take 65% of everything these hundreds of thousands of people strived to build and save for their entire lives.  It means as close relatives pass on in life, those they worked for their entire lives will only see 35% in inheritance.  Now, don't forget...your state inheritance taxes would also have to be added to that number and would approximate on average another 15% of the total amount of the inheritance you will probably be expecting.Which means, in essence, every American would receive about 20% of the inheritance you thought you'd be getting.  Those who built their savings and properties wanted it all for you...Clinton wants to share a bit of it with you!Once this is law...just remember, you voted for Hillary.  Oh yeah, btw...Obamacare is going to double your costs in the next two years and Clinton is not getting rid of it.http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.snopes.com%2Fhillary-clinton-farms-estate-tax%2F&h=XAQG92-v7

David Brooks on Republicans who dislike Trump but support him because they want a conservative to pick the next Supreme Court justice(s): "I think their argument that the Supreme Court is worth it is basically the wrong argument when he’s behaving this way."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Clifford E. Katz | 10154686406888675_10154686482243675 | Friends - let's get real here, the GOP Nominee is not a conservative, he's a faux candidate, whom is an ill-informed, inexperienced ignoramus, with an undiagnosed personality disorder. Anyone whom considers his candidacy as a sound strategy for influencing the Supreme Court, is a complete fool.
2 | Rose Steward | 10154686406888675_10154686672893675 | That empty seat on the court rightfully belongs to the 66 million Americans who voted for President Obama in 2012. This is a theft, plain and simple, in full view of everyone, and we are just putting up with it.
3 | Kathy Wentzel | 10154686406888675_10154686504413675 | Football game methodology has no place in a Democracy.  Bashing and begrudging your opponent, divisive philosophy of home and visitor (them and us), and conquer and defeat mentality not only systematically destroys a democracy, it is in contradiction with:  “….. one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”  Believers of true democratic principles do not spit in the eye of others due to a difference of belief, nor do the manipulate democratic process to further their own interests while disenfranchising others.
4 | Adam Tarver | 10154686406888675_10154686476078675 | Holding people hostage instead of legislating is what they have done for 8 years.. We have a ton of gov shutdowns behind us as proof of the fact..
5 | Judith Hurley | 10154686406888675_10154686598048675 | I feel bad for David Brooks.  He is a very good person, a bit too conservative for my taste, but ethical and very disappointed right now.
6 | George Davis | 10154686406888675_10154686620838675 | He's totally and vindictively unpredictable.  He, if he's lucky enough to win the presidency, may well choose LIBERAL judges to spite the republican establishment for a perceived betrayal.  There's no telling what he might do.....g
7 | Sue Whitcomb | 10154686406888675_10154686675438675 | This election SHOULD have shown us the dangers of extreme ideologies. As a country we have work to do -- and we won't be kept from it by a perpetually polarized Congress. The GOP needs to control elements in its party that have made obstruction their highest calling. And if the Democrats get control of either house, they better not use the same strategies. If you really THINK about it, the important issues are not partisan issues. YOU WORK FOR US. Get on it or get out of the way.
8 | Scotty Jones Cherryholmes | 10154686406888675_10154686499563675 | Mark Sheilds continues to disappoint. I finally figured it out. He was around during the Bill Clinton years. So many journalists back then felt they had been betrayed by President Clinton during the Monica affair. They stood up for him and then had to back down. Those people will never forgive. So anytime Mark has an opportunity to speak up for the democratic candidate, he folds. He needs to get over it.
9 | Sharon Pugh | 10154686406888675_10154686699523675 | I agree that Trump supporters will and do feel betrayed. Trump is going to use that to create a real fracture in our social structure. Folks, we are in serious trouble. One of the big problems is that a great many Americans do not understand how our government works. This has been proven by Trump's manipulation of facts. He doesn't understand it either. I do not know if we are going to stay one nation. Many of these  people have been so influenced by misinformation that it may be too late to try and fix this. Republicans are guilty of encouraging these beliefs, but Democrats are guilty of ignoring these people. Neither party forced the Citizen United issue to a vote or attempted to create an amendment to the Constitution. The racism of Mitch McConnell towards President Obama is part of the problem. I will never forgive him for furthering the divide in our country. He and Benedict Arnold have a lot in common.
10 | Richard Stewart | 10154686406888675_10154686526428675 | I don't think it's a wrong argument. I'm certainly not voting for Hillary Clinton because of her honesty and trustworthiness. Hell even I can say I think she got away with something just because of who she is. I just would prefer a more liberal justice.
11 | Frank Cain | 10154686406888675_10154686537938675 | We just don't want someone who should be under indictment for destroying govt property, obstruction of justice, and negligence to be our next president.
12 | Riki Horton | 10154686406888675_10154686739653675 | David Brooks is the one that's dreary himself. As strongly as he disapproves of Trump, he never can lay off his nitpicking of Hillary. What does that man want?

14 | Missy Chaud | 10154686406888675_10154686599553675 | It's the wrong argument anyway. It's unpatriotic and pathetic. A true testament to their legacy of obstruction and partisanship.

Oh yeah, btw...Obamacare is going to double your costs in the next two years and Clinton is not getting rid of it.http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.snopes.com%2Fhillary-clinton-farms-estate-tax%2F&h=XAQG92-v7

Mission scientists believe the lander's thrusters failed to fire, causing it to hit the ground at a speed greater than 186 miles per hour.

Any candidate with 5 percent or more in that poll received an invite — and Duke narrowly hit the mark, getting 5.1 percent in the telephone survey done by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research.

Was the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner a charity event or a roast?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | John Pace | 10154686389323675_10154686424263675 | Answer: Yes. Each candidate told some pretty funny jokes. A couple of Hillary's were groaners, but she made up for that with her appeal at the end for the return of decency in civil discourse. Trump started off with a couple of hoots, but then reverted to his stump speech insults and name-calling. Precisely the OPPOSITE of Hillary's closing message. Once again it became crystal clear which candidate is the true leader.
2 | Simmy Taub | 10154686389323675_10154686403108675 | Thank you, Donald Trump, for making America vote blue again.
3 | Kevin Dellinger | 10154686389323675_10154686391343675 | I'm pretty sure I saw him at a Donald Trump KKK rally recently!
4 | Yoko Sugata | 10154686389323675_10154686454323675 | Instead of making jokes about himself, Trump brought down his wife instead. The second half of his speech was just toxic and vicious, i could not even believe this is our presidential candidate.  Absolutely disgusting.
5 | Jackie Carmichael | 10154686389323675_10154686537563675 | All I know is that it looked like Heir Drumpf is a very slow reader and had to point to each word as he read it....

11 | Carol Oliva | 10154686389323675_10154686551748675 | Clinton jobs plan on her website. Clinton boast about how she helped create jobs in Upstate New York. And so her current jobs plan for America is a carbon copy of the plan she used in Upstate New York. There's only one problem,Clinton didn't create any new jobs in Upstate New York. From Oct 2001 to Dec 2006 Clinton lost 31,000 jobs in Upstate New York.  Bad on trade deals, and bad on job creation.

Early Friday, hackers struck the New Hampshire-based web company Dyn, which controls one of the cornerstones of U.S. internet infrastructure.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Joe Armstrong | 10154685964473675_10154686167558675 | Hillary Clinton wants to establish a 65% inheritance tax on the savings and property of every Americans relatives, parents, grandparents or any other relative who "God Bless Them" pass away.  This means she wants the Federal Government to take a one-time grab using the IRS to take 65% of everything these hundreds of thousands of people strived to build and save for their entire lives.  It means as close relatives pass on in life, those they worked their entire lives will only see 35% in inheritance.  Now, don't forget...your state inheritance taxes would also have to be added to that number and would approximate on average another 15% of the total amount of the inheritance you will probably be expecting.Which means, in essence, every American would receive about 20% of the inheritance you thought you'd be getting.  Those who built their savings and properties wanted it all for you...Clinton wants to share a bit of it with you!Once this is law...just remember, you voted for Hillary.  Oh yeah, btw...Obamacare is going to double your costs in the next two years and Clinton is not getting rid of it.
2 | Sherry Adragna | 10154685964473675_10154686385918675 | This crap is getting just a little scary. Going back to cash, phone calls, and letters.

5 | David Sloman | 10154685964473675_10154686281833675 | Makes me wonder if a lock-down of my laptop a few days ago and a note from a friend telling me of an email she received two days ago that she knew was not from me, are related to this attack.
6 | Judith Louise Titarniuk | 10154685964473675_10154686290048675 | If nothing else causes the downfall of the modern world cyber hacking can do the job.
7 | Deborah Cook | 10154685964473675_10154686120958675 | It's the Russians...now they are attacking the NYT's anti-trump campaign, well done hackers…
8 | Scott Tucker | 10154685964473675_10154686229008675 | They were checking to see if they could keep coms down for, oh.. I don't know... say 4 minutes?
9 | Richard Gougeon | 10154685964473675_10154686256628675 | Hillary Clinton will surely say it's Russia fault! For Hillary it seems Russia is everywhere while in fact it's rather the NSA who's everywhere don't you think.
10 | Luke Sharkey | 10154685964473675_10154686133678675 | It's not a hack. It's a ddos attack.

LIVE NOW: What does the shifting electoral map mean for Clinton and Trump? Judy Woodruff speaks with correspondent Lisa Desjardins and Nathan Gonzales of The Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report. #RoadTo270
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Alicia Schaub | 10154686016953675_10154686034133675 | Mom and I voted for Hillary today in Ohio. The early voting place was packed and there was a line. High voter turnout is usually a good omen for Democrats.
2 | Alicia Schaub | 10154686016953675_10154686036348675 | Sanders will be head of Budget Committee when the Republicans go down in flames.
3 | Sandy Gustafson | 10154686016953675_10154686051438675 | Blues get moving!  I already voted!  You can too!  Landslide for Hillary!  Don't want to repeat the Gore thing!  You know what Bush did and the Orange one would be so much worse!
4 | Ted Kuester | 10154686016953675_10154686037423675 | Voting for Jill or Johnson? Save your gas. Write on a piece of paper and throw it in the toilet. Will have the same affect.
5 | Erin Tiani Daly | 10154686016953675_10154686029403675 | But everyone still has to get out and vote!  Don't take the win for granted!
6 | David Velasco | 10154686016953675_10154686029523675 | Jill Stein needs to go back to aromatherapy store she stocks shelves in. Her policies are so out of whack she's no progressive she's clueless.
7 | Ted Kuester | 10154686016953675_10154686033088675 | Our country will survive either one....but will thrive under Hillary.
8 | Carmine Russo | 10154686016953675_10154686029108675 | I'm listening to this, and thinking, "You mean to tell me, he actually still has a chance?"  Anyone would think that he is done.
9 | Cynthia Fellez | 10154686016953675_10154686065553675 | 18-year-olds, yes 18-year-olds, vote because this is the trajectory for the rest of your adult life.… Hillary is the only answer❣️
10 | PJ Granieri | 10154686016953675_10154686036053675 | I already voted 4 Hillary Clinton as she will win in a LANDSLIDE AS WE WOMEN TAKE THE DON DOWN~
11 | Jeff Rich | 10154686016953675_10154686028543675 | I'm hopeful that he's headed for oblivion. I may be dreaming.
12 | Bill Allemon | 10154686016953675_10154686028033675 | Clinton is already measuring the Oval Office for new curtains.
13 | Joyce Flock | 10154686016953675_10154686163233675 | I voted for Hillary and all democrats,Republicans are not the party they used to be and it is sad to see,because we need at least 2 strong parties.
14 | Kirby Chadwick | 10154686016953675_10154686056343675 | It is awful that we have this stupid electoral college and that certain states matter and others don't and that the popular vote doesn't matter. It's time we got rid of the electoral college.
15 | Dolores Campbell | 10154686016953675_10154686042223675 | i hate that nasty woman so much im just going to vote blue straight down that ticket , and see how she likes those apples.
16 | Victoria Tisdale | 10154686016953675_10154686083643675 | Vote blue down ticket too. Hillary needs a congress to work with instead of the do nothings.
17 | Frieda Whipple | 10154686016953675_1787825821475342 | Hillary has Bernie's wants in her economic plan. Don't vote for Jill and waste what Bernie fought so hard for. If we win the Senate Bernie wins!!!!
18 | Wendy Pelton | 10154686016953675_10154686035588675 | Lisa Desjardins is one of the best political reporters I've seen this year.
19 | Eric Toth | 10154686016953675_10154686024363675 | It means Madame President by a landslide.
20 | Gordon Roberts | 10154686016953675_10154686030858675 | Jill Stein is at 1-2% - She is going back to her offshore villa to sip Russian vodka with Assange 😜.
21 | Barbara Rosenblum | 10154686016953675_10154686036938675 | Lisa Dejardins might be the future's Judy Woodruff.  She's just great.
22 | Cathy Doser | 10154686016953675_1084750691614963 | Like to introduce to you, the 45th president of the United States, Hillary Clinton!

#ICYMI: Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump took turns roasting each other at the 2016 Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. See their full speeches here: http://to.pbs.org/2dw3l4G
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Scotty Jones Cherryholmes | 10154685952543675_10154686007113675 | Nope. I really don't need to. I will vote for Hillary Clinton. No need for any more of Trump's belligerence. I would feel sorry for the Republicans, but they brought this horror onto themselves. Trump and the GOP deserve one another.
2 | Brenda Drake | 10154685952543675_10154686092408675 | This description doesn't describe just how insulting Trump was. It was so bad that some the wealthy attendees started to heckle him. The faces of those in view went from pleasant to grim. His disgusting behavior just continues to get worse.
3 | Michael Magee | 10154685952543675_10154686005733675 | To the Republicans and trolls , can't wait till Nov 9 and people realize what they have done, by the time Trump's first 4 years are up we will be living in a police state and there will be no green party no protest no strikes not in America remember Kent state,60s riots and Reagan and air traffic controllers!!! Oh and no SSI
4 | Marilyn Kopecky | 10154685952543675_10154686004488675 | Rush = Folks, they never boo at this dinner. The reason they are booing is because Trump didn't follow protocol. He came in there and campaigned. And you're not supposed to do that at this dinner. You're supposed to make fun of yourself and tell everybody in there, particularly if you're the Republican, what a joke you are, and he didn't do it. He got booed -- and I bet it was an honor.
5 | Jared Mathew | 10154685952543675_10154685972583675 | Any other day liberals would be mocking and insulting Catholics. They bring up the sexual abuse of children at every turn. Not today though. Because donald Trump suddenly made them respect Catholicism.The self righteous indignation from the left lately is pathetic and wholly hypocritical on their part. It's not conservative networks airing the filth on TV and media today. Those are liberals. And they lean on free speech as their defense. They rarely lean on decency and morality, except of course if it's Trump saying bad words.
6 | Chris Marsh | 10154685952543675_10154686605108675 | Sorry people. These two recently went through 3 debates, slinging dirt and insults, some subtle and some not so subtle; downright mean stuff and personal. Now, the appear together for a 'Dean Martin Roast', do joke about each other. I must be dreaming.....it just doesn't add up.
7 | Simon Bradley | 10154685952543675_10154685971643675 | Hahahahaha! They are both so funny. I'm sure the 324 million Americans won't be able to stop rolling around on the floor when one of these is in power.
8 | Frank James Lopez | 10154685952543675_10154686382398675 | I found it ironic that Trump mentioned how he had attended the Catholic Charities Event with his Father ;when in fact his Father was arrested in a Queens,NYC KKK a Anti-Catholic rally...
9 | Carrie Nelson | 10154685952543675_10154685974233675 | Hillary isn't the one who came across as a paranoid, raving lunatic during the final debate. ;)
10 | Matty Ofusa | 10154685952543675_10154686364003675 | He had some great jokes and was doing well but the line about hating Catholics was just beyond classless. It was bad even for him.
11 | Bobby Joe Rose | 10154685952543675_10154686205288675 | I am surprised the Archbishop could sit so close to that stinky witch. i thoroughly enjoy watching Trump read her off and the dumbfounded look on her face lol
12 | Scotty Jones Cherryholmes | 10154685952543675_10154686266523675 | It is funny to watch these desperate Trump supporters. Their candidate is going to lose. It's gonna be huuuge. And I am going to love it.
13 | Mike Akins | 10154685952543675_10154686112543675 | I will never again donate to public broadcasting after hearing the obvious lies and bias towards Donald Trump after listening to the PBS(ProBullS#!+)Hour.
14 | Dotty Petrosky | 10154685952543675_10154686273208675 | I'm for Hillary-because the idea of Trump is unspeakable!
15 | Yoko Sugata | 10154685952543675_10154686017058675 | Instead of making jokes about himself, Trump brought down his wife instead. The second half of his speech was just toxic and vicious, i could not even believe this is our presidential candidate.  Absolutely disgusting.
16 | Ken Perkins | 10154685952543675_10154686292808675 | So Trump's criticism of the Pope is no big deal? Trump totally disgraced himself at Al Smith dinner, just as he's done to our democratic electoral process. https://www.theguardian.com/.../donald-trump-pope-francis...
17 | Vance Keaton | 10154685952543675_10154685984743675 | You ever notice that democrats never chant USA at a Hillary rally, or have you noticed that democrats do not wear USA flag pins, or notice that the democrats do not display our flag, isn't that wierd?
18 | Matt Hutchins | 10154685952543675_10154686080993675 | Wow, SNL is really stepping up their game. They look just like them.
19 | Matty Ofusa | 10154685952543675_10154686365953675 | Btw: the look of hate on that pathological and casual liar Rudy's face when he ripped him - oh man - priceless
20 | Dusty Decker | 10154685952543675_10154686100603675 | He was a good sport in these clips. He looked happier than in days past. His delivery was bad but hey he is not a comedian thank god lol
21 | Constance Luedtke | 10154685952543675_10154686084208675 | At this dinner, she buried him, and he didn't know it
22 | Linda Lewis Vanselow | 10154685952543675_10154686203363675 | There final comments to each other after the public dinner were very telling!
23 | Greg Clackson | 10154685952543675_10154686229543675 | She just totally outclasses Trump. No question about it.
24 | Eve Chandler | 10154685952543675_10154686487463675 | Thought to myself while watching the clip, "My golly ... calling people fat?  Look at yourself!"
25 | Sanae Abdallah | 10154685952543675_10154686525798675 | I wonder if Trump's wife understands what is being said?! 😂😂😂😂

“Many people in these communities of color feel they have been the subject of police violence for decades. And when an officer engages in conduct that adds or enhances that divide, they are ultimately jeopardizing the integrity of their agencies and putting their fellow officers in danger.”
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Crystal Keller | 10154685728163675_10154685750353675 | I think the FBI needs to look into our border patrol officers also. If it's true that they endorsed Trump, then it definitely seems suspicious.
2 | Brian Taylor | 10154685728163675_10154686119793675 | Thank goodness for groups like the SPLC: "In the 10 years since the FBI’s initial warning, little has changed, neither the FBI nor state and local law enforcement agencies have established systems for vetting personnel for potential supremacist links. That task is left up primarily to every day citizens and nonprofit organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center.”
3 | Tom Morris | 10154685728163675_10154685749718675 | Rage against the machine warned people of it 16 years ago...
4 | Dipu Thomas Nanthikattu | 10154685728163675_10154686190278675 | This is a known fact that there are people who are biased against people of color in the police force. A simple report of traffic citations by demography  given by an officer will reveal the bias. Why can't the government make use of that data to disciple racist officers?
5 | Tim Brooks | 10154685728163675_10154685977943675 | Regardless if you are for Hillary or Trump please help fight against what we have been allowing.The war on drugs without being greatly changed should be a crime. We have spent 100's of billions without an upside - never reducing users but yet doing great harm to their lives- tarnished resumes, invasive police forces, keeping safer alternatives out of their hand, targeted minorities, and inner cities, more so, etc. That has to be changed. It is the first step at cleaning up, educating, and training our police officers to be THERE FOR PEOPLE- not against.Private prisons also has to be ended. It is not a joke to have slave camps in a modern era.
6 | Gary Eckstein | 10154685728163675_10154685829183675 | they have been made worse by trump's rhetoric and are more of a threat than 10 years ago
7 | Paul Montague | 10154685728163675_10154685734758675 | They need to be systematically removed! It's like putting child molesters in a children's daycare.
8 | James Carroll | 10154685728163675_10154685889183675 | WE NEED A CHANGE IN WASHINGTON; WE NEED TO GET RID OF THOSE DO NOTHING REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS!
9 | Jeremy Nakai Gonzales | 10154685728163675_10154686397028675 | I'm sure there are bad people in law enforcement. Don't dilute yourself though, it's the vast majority of cops that are good, hard working, decent men and women. I've been pulled over 4 times and I've only ever gotten one ticket because I was less than cordial to the officer because I was late. If you're polite to the officer 9 times out of 10 you won't get a ticket or even a written warning. People already hate police officers, they have enough of a hard job as it is. Don't group good officers and bad officers together.
10 | Rick Martinez | 10154685728163675_10154686139543675 | Several key events preceded the report. A federal court found that members of a Los Angeles sheriffs department formed a Neo Nazi gang and habitually terrorized the black community. Later, the Chicago police department fired Jon Burge, a detective with reputed ties to the Ku Klux Klan, after discovering he tortured over 100 black male suspects. Thereafter, the Mayor of Cleveland discovered that many of the city police locker rooms were infested with “White Power” graffiti. Years later, a Texas sheriff department discovered that two of its deputies were recruiters for the Klan.In near prophetic fashion, after the FBI’s warning, white supremacy extremism in the U.S. increased, exponentially. From 2008 to 2014, the number of white supremacist groups, reportedly, grew from 149 to nearly a thousand, with no apparent abatement in their infiltration of law enforcement.
11 | Michael Kusiek | 10154685728163675_10154685818218675 | folks with a high need for power and control are drawn to jobs where they get to exercise those needs.  must hire better
12 | Brian O'Shea | 10154685728163675_10154686236843675 | I don't know why they needed to warn anyone; in this part of the country, white supremacists have been part or most of law enforcement since Jim Crow.
13 | Carl H. Inglin | 10154685728163675_10154686282008675 | I remember that. The FBI warned about white supremacists and the Republicans in Congress got their collective panties in a twist at the very thought.
14 | John Pace | 10154685728163675_10154686490433675 | Just a few blocks away in my NE Florida community a police officer has had up Trump, Make America Great Again, and Hillary Lies signs for months. More power to the guy for exercising his first amendment rights. But I still cringe at the attitude he brings to his job, particularly when encountering any one of the several groups Trump has demonized since day-one of his campaign.
15 | Billy R. Miller | 10154685728163675_10154685734238675 | We had to purge them from the army back in the 90's.
16 | Robert Kubena | 10154685728163675_10154685803998675 | Not really. More jobs, more promotion and higher pay. Self-interesr: just like Dumph.

18 | Liz Feeser-Regan | 10154685728163675_10154686208063675 | I think for some this happens over time dealing with low lifes. Has nothing to do with race it has to do now with lack of trust in man kind.
19 | Carol Vandersluys | 10154685728163675_10154686270248675 | The rabid rights kicked up a huge fit so anything done had to go underground.
20 | Vince Stropko | 10154685728163675_10154686243808675 | Perfect, blame all for a few. Likes like blaming all doctors for a few horrible ones. Well done
21 | Betty DeBerg | 10154685728163675_10154686286483675 | Law enforcement was a haven for the KKK during the 1950s and 60s
22 | Steve Mack | 10154685728163675_10154686176568675 | Hmmm 10 years ago and Obama hasn't did anything to change it in almost 8?  All the Dems do is pander to the scared voters
23 | Alice Rogers | 10154685728163675_10154686666253675 | As s white personal who hears a lot of negativity, let's nip in in the £uckun bud.
24 | George Davis | 10154685728163675_10154686430258675 | What's changed is that there are MORE of them now......g
25 | Benjamin A. Smith | 10154685728163675_10154686169658675 | Nothing has changed except the Klansman uniform. It used to be a sheet.  Now it is a blue or black uniform and we pay them.

Of the 8,354 complaints against the company, the most frequent — one in five – were people who had problems repaying their loans.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sheryl Fisher | 10154685425913675_10154686270148675 | The complaint I have heard most often from friends with student debt - I don't have student debt - is that the interest rate has gone sky high as their debt was sold off to other companies. Perhaps loans could be offered with fixed rates and low penalties, that way no 'usury', no whining, no sympathy. Also perhaps option of public service hours for people who feel stuck. (just spitballing here)
2 | Travis Clark | 10154685425913675_10154685989373675 | U can always just NOT take a loan.. there are so many jobs in this world that can be achieved without putting yourself 100,000 in debt. We are in vast need of electricians and plumbers in this country. I know it's not glamorous but u can make just as much money with a 1/5 of the debt. Not everyone has to go to college.. it's ok
3 | Joseph Rhea | 10154685425913675_10154686167588675 | University tuition prices have exploded because there is essentially no limit on the amount students can borrow.  The universities get their money up front from the government-to-student loan, and when the students default (because the education was basically worthless), it's the borrower (usually a dopey 18 year old kid at the time the debt was taken on) or the taxpayer who eats it.  Universities will never contain costs or deliver a quality product until this consumer-debt financing scam is stopped.
4 | Juanita Hepler | 10154685425913675_10154686503293675 | Leaving our young people to struggle to pay the outrageous cost of college and then destroying their wonderful energy and optimism with student debt is so sad and unacceptable.A college education is not just about a job; it also provides knowledge across a wide spectrum introducing students  to the arts, sciences, history, etc thus expanding their horizons, goals, opportunities, and ability to contribute to the betterment of society.Student debt should be forgiven with no tax penalty. We can do this provided we require corporations and the top 1% to pay their fair share.Did I have student loans -yes I did;Did I pay them off - yes I did;Do I want our young people to endure the hardship - an emphatic NO!We can do better for our children.
5 | James Berry | 10154685425913675_10154685939158675 | This debt load is as serious as the banks failing but I don't profess to know what needs to happen. It's unreasonable to think the government will just forgive people's loans but something needs to happen.
6 | William Maxwell | 10154685425913675_10154686379808675 | You can get an apprenticeship with the plumber and pipefitters Union in Boston Massachusetts and after 4 years you will make $ 51.50 an hour with no college debt
7 | Shannon Martin | 10154685425913675_10154685726298675 | Companies shouldn't be bailed out, and neither should students...think about what your wasting your life on and if that's a good investment in yourself
8 | Margaret A Bellfy | 10154685425913675_10154686147563675 | It's not so much the initial debt, it's the compounding of interest that digs the hole deeper.
9 | Jan Sylvester | 10154685425913675_10154685754773675 | Each person with student loan debt should be provided with a quarterly consolidated statement.
10 | James Carroll | 10154685425913675_10154685891363675 | WE NEED A CHANGE IN WASHINGTON; WE NEED TO GET RID OF THOSE DO NOTHING REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS!

12 | Paula A. Zancanella Bradford | 10154685425913675_10154685750658675 | Something needs to be done to help these high/debt students!
13 | John Taylor | 10154685425913675_10154685635728675 | Snowden docs gave a look into what the govt does to maintain the lie surveillance dirty tricks after decades of election rigging assasinations supporting dictators to save a dollar on a gallon of gas...voters can connect the dots with the wikileaks docs on why poverty is so rampant even with a DEM in the WH...its all a lie...Trump is right ...the system is rigged for the rich with media making it great theater...time to throw these bastarns out spies generals those who pretend to help the third world with secret contraceptive programs in the guise of vaccinations...soon they will do it here

16 | Rick Schrenker | 10154685425913675_10154686055058675 | We've dealt with Navient.  They make it difficult to pay down loans.  I'm an engineer and can do the math; they don't want to let the principal drop if they can help it.  They also make it difficult to pay more than their monthly minimum. They need to be investigated.

Just the Students and Graduates who are burdened by school debt, can put her in office.  With Bernie in the Senate passing bills, and Jill signing them into Law.   Magic can happen!   Hillary should step aside and let the voter have the President that we NEED.   The Clintons should be tried for TREAON.    youtube.com/watch?v=dEaKzja_CX0

Evan McMullin’s stunning ascent into relevancy has everyone asking: Who is this guy?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Michael Agosta | 10154685367808675_10154685414943675 | McMullin isn't a "new conservative" he is more of the same. Trouble is, the GOP working class no longer want more of the same. He is just one more guy in teh Bush/Cruz/McCain/Rubio fold who can't oust the Donald Trumps in the brave new GOP world.The GOP needs to get off the "business is best" at all costs strategy, or they are in for a long, hard haul.
2 | Robert Barnes | 10154685367808675_10154685655538675 | He looks interesting only in comparison the turd barbecue that was the GOP season. He is standard issue weak water GOP. Move along, nothing to see here.
3 | John Tucker | 10154685367808675_10154685596853675 | Utah is the most conservative state. But a different type of conservatism then that, that roams the south and other red states. They don't like Bluster, they are strict in their values. They are much pro family, so a Lying, Cheating, sexist, trash talking leader is not going to play there. He might win by a pct, but he will not win over the church going, value minded conservative there. Not going to happen.
4 | Jerome Edgington | 10154685367808675_10154685674723675 | He is a republican back door strategy. According to the constitution, if no candidate gets 270 electoral votes, the House must choose from the top 3 electoral vote getters. So, they had to run someone in a state where he/she had a chance of winning, and getting an electoral vote. Utah is their best shot. Then they have to hope no one gets 270, so when the House chooses, it has a mainstream republican to elect. Pretty clever of them.

6 | Dave Haeffner | 10154685367808675_10154686160068675 | I live in Utah and only hears of him 3 days ago.  It seems only church going mormons know who he is. Makes me think the church itself is pushing hard for him. The church has proven in the past to be very invovled in politics.
7 | Sandra Arnold | 10154685367808675_10154685800333675 | McMullin seems a truly compassionate conservative that doesn't support the hate, bigotry, misogyny, elitism and racism of the Trump nomination.
8 | George Campbell | 10154685367808675_10154685734043675 | He is just a symbol of Mormon hypocrisy. Mormons are as responsible as anyone for making the GOP what it is today - they can't hide away their guilt by voting for this nobody.

13 | John Taylor | 10154685367808675_10154685408098675 | America could structure its distribution chains with calculated prices profits wages to factor in a working population of 130 million caring for a total population of 300 million...its math it shouldnt be about power...but we like concentrating wealth the idea of getting rich not getting prosperous...and then of course we have to create and defend the narratives that support the LIE..Wikileaks confirms what Trumo said.....election is rigged. Illegals hispanics to vote with the rich thinking HIllary will give them a pass to be Americans...bring grandparents cousins...old story dangle a carrot DEMS have been doing that for 20 years...same with the unemployed blacks they were sold a bill of goods sold out by the DEM black caucus and still come back for more...DEMS are skilled at containment for the rich...keeping a lid on ...else they would have raised wages and modernized social policy like some European countries...wake up Trump what have you got to lose

1 | Janice Dorris | 10154685334383675_10154685352638675 | Well thank goodness. Russia is to involved in our Election as it is Thanks To Donald J Trump.
2 | Jeremy Baker | 10154685334383675_10154685369203675 | Right, because Russia is SOOO interested in running fair elections in their country
3 | Ghania Habbi | 10154685334383675_10154685356323675 | Whaaat??? No no no! Russian officers ?? Why there's not enough Americans to oversee the election?? We always voted in peace, what's wrong with these morons??
4 | Liz Smith | 10154685334383675_10154685399113675 | This is totally unacceptable! It really begs the legitimate question about Trump's ties to Russia. He has expressed his admiration for Putin. There have been repeated hacking attempts which the federal government has expressed certainty that Russia is involved and now this. It sure would be interesting to see Trump's financials ... Perhaps some business schmoozing with Russia? When he loses the election maybe he'll turn it back on them and say that the Feds have been saying Putin is behind it!He is a scary person; to say the very least !
5 | Jason Argiro | 10154685334383675_10154685362218675 | This is proof of everyone's worst fears of Russian effort to influence the American election.
6 | Karen Hanwell Ritzic | 10154685334383675_10154685385603675 | It is common knowledge that Ivanka and Putin’s daughter are close friends. That Trumps son said they have business in Russia. Trump has said he knows Putin. His manager made huge deal. Yet, people are confused about Trumps connection with Putin. Odd.
7 | Linda Lutz Dehnert | 10154685334383675_10154685781393675 | Snowden should be brought back & paid for his expertise. Russia is hacking him. Hello😜someone needs to listen to him, not punish him for trying to help our country😉
8 | Eddie Kinsley | 10154685334383675_10154685592588675 | I'd welcome the Canadians, Mexicans, Germans, Japanese, English, Israelis, Polish, Australians, French, etc. to monitor the polls because their governments respect the democratic system and they bid goodwill to our country, but not to undemocratic, anti-US countries. The free world needs mutual mutually exclusive support, especially these days.
9 | Nell Schiavi | 10154685334383675_10154685749783675 | Considering they're trying to affect our elections through Espionage and cyber crime I think it's rather insane to even think that they should be allowed to monitor our elections. It's interesting in Russia how their elections are run. Like most dictators in the world Putin always wins with 97%. I don't think the Russians understand what a democratic election actually is
10 | Randolph Graul | 10154685334383675_10154685951443675 | Russia has no business at our polling places as monitors. I personally, wouldn't stop they're news agencies, but at least we can keep them a good distance away!
11 | William Dailey | 10154685334383675_10154685822943675 | Mighty neighborly of Putin to off help isn't it? Like Donald says give him respect. Got any more emails you need located?  (I wonder if it's something in the water supply?)  Will the GOP feel elated when it's their emails being posted by Wikileaks?
12 | Torey Davis | 10154685334383675_10154685577768675 | This is so bizarre, the whole state of affairs. I remember watching Boris Yeltsin standing on a tank, during the birth of the Russian Federation and the fall of the USSR. But with the cyber war we obviously are in, although not officially announced, and the proxy war in Syria-like it's revenge for getting kicked out of Afghanistan, all of this feels like Cold War Part II.
13 | Chris Johnson | 10154685334383675_10154686022008675 | Tip: investigate whether they are making requests in spots that have paperless voting machines. They could be snooping the network communications that go on between machines, looking for exploits. Although why they wouldn't just have some deep cover operative do this quietly I have no idea.
14 | Sharon Capel Dessisso | 10154685334383675_10154685948483675 | Am I the only one who finds this insulting and humiliating. Putin is trying to undermine our election and he doesn't know squat about our election process. I've voted in every election since 1968. I've worked at the polls, at the NYC Board of Elections and I was an interpreter at immediate court hearings for people who were challenged when they showed up to vote.  There are NYC policeman at every polling place to maintain order here in NYC.  No one is double voting or voting a deceased.  This is not to say that there had never been an incident of voter fraud. As we all know, criminals will always find away to steal your stuff.  But in general it is EXTREMELY hard to do. A lawyer did a study and discovered that among 1 billion votes cast, there were only 31 incidences of voter fraud.  Do the math, that is an infinitesimally small ratio.  If you want it in visual terms think of the scene in Breaking Bad with all that money, several million dollars in the storage room, now think about taking 31 dollars only from that pile of money. And that was only several million.  31 out of 1 billion votes.  Trump and his supporters need to get a life.
15 | Jayne Barnard | 10154685334383675_10154685737758675 | Precincts everywhere are going to be crawling with observers and monitors this Election Day.  Rs and Ds are both mobilizing armies of watchers. Election officials who decline to let foreign observers be there too, so long as they don't  interfere with orderly voting, are grandstanding.
16 | Robert Strovers | 10154685334383675_10154685734023675 | Well we send folks to monitor elections all over the world, why not let them observe and see how we do it. There's a method to our madness.
17 | Katherine Edwards | 10154685334383675_10154686692008675 | As US monitors other countries, then other countries should be allowed to monitor US. These types of actions stir resentment against US.
18 | Everett Clifford | 10154685334383675_10154685452013675 | If the American people could hold a election with out voting fraud, this wouldn't be a issue, Hillary Clinton and Deb Schultz, Democratic party committed voting fraud, the Russian Government had nothing to do with it, the ignorance the American people show is so pathetic,.
19 | Connie Mack-Ward | 10154685334383675_10154686287603675 | Nice of them to fly in to join the minions Trump has asked to spend election day "watching" polls other than their own--guns on hip, no doubt.
20 | Ioan Rosca | 10154685334383675_10154685377373675 | As if the Russians are the gold standard to the electoral process....
21 | Ray Cottengaim | 10154685334383675_10154685382583675 | Russian sympathizer trumpeter would have no problem with this as well as that traitor trump.

There is a solution, it's called working the electoral college against them both. It's going to take guts. Here is how, if you live in a state that does not require write in registration (Vermont, Wyoming, Oregon, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Iowa, Delaware, and Alabama) you write in Bernie. This will remove those states from the electoral map which makes it easier for a third party candidate to win enough electoral votes with the other states. Everyone else, if your state is mostly blue, vote Jill Stein. If your state is mostly red, vote Gary Johnson. This should swing the majority vote to the third party candidate in most cases. Neither Jill Stein or Gary Johnson are perfect candidates, but Clinton and Trump sure as heck aren't either. But Stein and Johnson are less likely to kill us or get us killed. Bernie would get a total of 49 electoral votes, if people did this it would kick it right over to the House who would choose from the top three. Trump and Clinton would not be president. Trump and Clinton are political poison to US House Reps who are up for election every two years. Beyond that, there is no guarantee Trump and Clinton will both be in the top three if people follow through with this, could be Bernie, Stein and Johnson. Like I said it's going to take guts but if we don't try we're weak and we will end up with Trump or Clinton anyway.

Until recently, doctors usually waited to discuss an IUD or implant until a woman’s first postnatal checkup, six weeks after delivery. But between 10 percent and 40 percent of women never show up for this exam.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ann Davis | 10154684939148675_10154685202258675 | 1) inserting an IUD right after birth poses risks, 2) the hormonal IUD can interfere with breastfeeding, 3) by 6 weeks, many low-income parents have had to go back to work which is why they can't make this appointment, so paid family leave would have a bigger impact on health and wellness and family planning. Stop making assumptions about low income families and start helping them.
2 | Allison Margaret Ellsworth | 10154684939148675_10154685304748675 | My doctor wanted me to wait at least 9 weeks which was better. Plus, getting to any other doctor appointments besides the pediatrician is difficult after birth so it doesn't surprise me.
3 | Sarah Gomez | 10154684939148675_10154686412793675 | I taught school-aged parent classes for over a decade. I can't tell you how many of these teen parents became pregnant before their 6 week postnatal check up. Many were planning to get an IUD at that check up but it was too late.
4 | Sj Lag | 10154684939148675_10154685304253675 | I'm not a fan of Hormonal IUD , better access to birthcontrol pills, Depo shot , etc. All could be given at the Hospital. The shot last four months at a time, if pills are chosen give her a 6 month supply. This is why Birth Control pills should be over the counter, just like in Europe.

2 | Shaul Ben-Yimini | 10154684918798675_10154685684428675 | Whereas some in ('the') NDP (recent @kady twitter-feed, when 'lactating' (twitter-feeds, that is)) seem quite pleased as to recent so-called 'Trans' issues (of the LGBT group) and would grandstand to state that as-much represents the 'collective will' of Canadians (seems, overclaiming-wise, recalling of 'Daas-Torah' overclaims) many seem, hence, exuberant as to such (merely) legislative (than moral-guidance) outcomes.Such an affect response (of jubilation) recalls, however, Alexander Pope ('The Globe & Mail' as has Juvenal in its masthead) regarding (THAT's the cohort Pope would emulate - Juvenal, Horace, etcetera) where-ignorance-is-bliss...'tis-folly-to-be-wise ('what mighty contests arise from the pursuit of trivial things' - 'Genus' edition...of you-know-what - as developped by 'Canadians' (including a woman) THAT's 'Cancon' for ya - a critique of 'Cancon' coming-up - Roe-v-Wade as the ACTUAL syncretism component...and it's not like Juvenal is 'Cancon,' besides.)So...the NDP (and others) are blissful...BECAUSE they are ignorant, it would seem...and of WHAT are they seemingly ignorant?Well...Blackstone makes the point (and he's reliable as to this - a tie-in, later, as to 'Cancon' pretensions) that with regards to murder, government laws are merely DECLARATIVE of such nearly-universally held prohibitions - there is NO added moral force to there being a CANADIAN law against murder, in other words (RATHER, murder as a no-no, conceptually, as a-priori to CANADA; we EXPECT Canada to have laws against murder, and NOT that we 'credit' Canada for then having as-much.)(On this point, CONCEPTUALLY, it would seem there's WIDE consensus - the Nazis, ISIS, Texas, they're ALL against MURDER (they have provisions against that)...and then, of-course, we might find their 'reasons' MORE than spurious whereby they might classify given acts as NOT murder, but under some OTHER rubric - it being okay to execute the retarded in Texas (as not murder in their eyes), whereas the Nazis in parallel fashion....)But-then-we-come to the claims regarding LGBT provisions...and where some in the NDP would think not ONLY that CANADA could function in any 'moral' way somehow OTHER than simply declaratively, BUT, that there is WIDE consensus as to as-much.In other words, THAT Canadian acts would STAND-out where they WOULD attempt to legislate 'morality' it's FAR from declarative, AND, THAT only highlights that there's FAR from being a consensus with regards these points.Others with their pseudo-scientific theories as to history or gender (also in the @kady recent twitter-feed, when 'lactating')...recall pseudo-scientitic theories of eugenics - more on right-wing measures, near-directly....The point of recent 'celebration' whereby LGBT (as considered at the T site) might be considered to have 'arrived' (or returned) in a 'Canadian' habitas...seem vaguely Zionist, by-import - as to palingenesis and 'arrival' / 'returning' and 'promised lands' perspectives.That's-just-it...the seeming dovetailing of same-sex-narcissism (LGBT) with same-race-narcissism (endogamy branded as 'multicultural' rather than a miscegenation model obtaining in Canada) recall apartheid as well as (as if THAT's not entailing, already) Zionism - as to such narcissism agendas (same-sex-narcissism, same-race-narcissism, or Zionism) seem to be RIGHT-wing agendas MASQUERADING as left-wing.So then...whereas in ACTUALITY (syncretism) there's abortion in Canada due to the impact of Roe-v-Wade (with local-site finalizings of such as like a Canadian branch-plant for abortion and simply a different Aristotleian cause involved in finalizing there being abortion in Canada, too) in-parallel to a SYNTHETIC 'Cancon' pretension (of trying to falsely make matters into an incestuous hermeneutic) some might then try to upsell there's abortion in-Canada due to (exclusively) Dr. Morgentaler, and the 'Charter' (um...matters stand in-Canada due to Canadian modes reflecting wide consensus, and NOT that 'murder' is wrong because CANADA says so, or the 'Charter' of some other nonsense.)It would seem that 'Cancon' incestuousness stems from a misguided and DESPERATE drive to DIFFERENTIATE Canada from the United States, so, if there's ANYTHING which might putatively be seized-upon to accomplish that...such tribal-nationalism agendas drive-hard - a sense that Canada might brand itself as fashion-forward on LGBT, to then try to differentiate itself from the United States, falsely, and as per how all the 'Cancon' industries then uptake such agendas...as-much recalls as to how (it being noted) OJ pundits became Clinton impeachment pundits.Within such seemingly implicit pyramid-schemes, then ((originally/primarily) 'Cancon' industries as pursuing a Kristevan pyramid-scheme as endlessly shifting their metrics in an aim to tread-water (?))...it would seem that LGBT identity-politics would get uptaked (recall same-sex narcissism and same-race narcissism dovetailing) as a kind of slumming for Whites (angling that they TOO might be minorities)...whereas AS it's then on some level implicitly understood that LGBT is about White-folk trying to brand themselves as a minority...then non-Whites associating with LGBT might be doing so as hoping that that BRAND will rub-off on them and have them perceived, thereby, as either more 'White' or as equal to such Whites, etcetera?!Not to forget, though, the unintended comedy whereby when Vic Toews message it-gets-better...Jamie Hubley as trending straight when he killed himself?!(Initially he identified as born-as-gay...then he chose to be born-as-bi...so seemingly...had he not killed himself...he might have trended to be straight...maybe he realized he was becoming straight...and feeling badly as to raising expectations he was G or B he then felt remorse over misleading people?)INSTEAD of such (Victorian - like Vic Toews (?)) antidisestablishmentarian agendas as the new overclaimstaking law would represent, consider an item of REAL importance:Proportional Representation Apocalypse'Monty Python's' 'Holy Grail' bunny...Bambi's mother wearing a kilt, to then reveal her proportions as per proportional representation, as Trudeau's Canada connotes not 'The Sound Of Music' as Julie Andrews with tear-away clothes as recalls Edwards/'S.O.B.'Kilt...on Ness...unseen/expressed....Rude...civility undressed....Doe...a-dear...as in the song....O-Canada...there's-something-far-far-wrong....So...Dufarge now pulling strings....La...her pronoun than a king's....Mead...a drink-by-dram with stings....Which-will-bring-us-back-to go...Kilt-Rude-Doe....(Copyleft Shaul Ben-Yimini October 21, 2016)

The super PAC was created by Cards Against Humanity co-founder Max Temkin to “poke at Donald Trump in the last stretch of the election.”
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Seán McCarthy | 10154684914693675_10154684939973675 | If Trump can't even contain himself at a charitable fundraiser that customarily allows for the limits of wit to be tested, what might he possibly say on a world stage to other world leaders, as President? Clearly the gutter is no limit for this dangerous loose cannon nitwit.
2 | Carol Brimacombe Marz | 10154684914693675_10154685331083675 | Come think this is way to subtle for Trump supporters and could in fact be seen as a threat by them. I wonder if the Local Muslim population was happy to Have this over their neighborhood?
3 | Mitra Raheb | 10154684914693675_10154685193448675 | so they make an ad in Arabic that's said support Hillary Clinton, a woman who not only took money from the House of Saud and the gulf countries but from countries that support 90% of Islamic terrorism around the world? Well, that makes sense. I'm sure in this election when people are afraid of Islamic terrorism writing in Arabic saying vote for Hillary Clinton is a good way to get vote for Hillary Clinton

6 | Steven Wiley | 10154684914693675_10154686423298675 | Analysis by the Tax Foundation of all that is currently known about the tax plans proposed by presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton concludes that, if enacted, Clinton’s plan would expand government at the expense of a shrinking economy. On the other hand, Trump’s plan would grow the economy, shrink government’s revenues, raise wages, and expand employment
7 | Letha Little | 10154684914693675_10154686509713675 | Still voting Trump to get our country back - remember HILLARY lied to the 4 military families - ask those families who they are voting for ?

9 | Gregg Durrance | 10154684914693675_10154685291413675 | I'm sure Trump has few surprises of his own to role out if he really wants to win.

15 | John Taylor | 10154684914693675_10154685026228675 | Look at what kinds of culture inform our sensibilities on world events...media sell us on whats good for the rich is good for us...then feminism creates another kind of tension within society a strange brew of zionism and militant lesbian politics shapes womens issues..that said abortion is a womans choice woneb deserve equal pay no question BUT feminism goes down much different road...then technology if we can invent something that replaces people great without any consideration of job loss or social consequences...all this roled up into nightly news propaganda that says YOU are on your own when we live in tightly interconnected units cities workplaces...we have to ask others for work to make a living not go out and farm ranch build own homes...we live in a throw away society that wants our money but not us NOT reallly
