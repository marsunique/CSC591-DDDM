5 | Sharon Kuhn Ariss | 22 | 10155546590851509_10155546604426509 | My newest horror story: Once upon a time there was a man named Donald Trump, and he ran for president. Some people wanted him to win.
6 | Mike Koslowski | 0 | 10155546590851509_10155546671476509 | You cannot change a corrupt system by mechanisms, which are part of that system in the first place. Do not vote, don't legitimize that system, organize ouside the system, change your consume behaviour, make use of civil disobedience, protest, strike...and if that doesn't work revolt.
7 | Wayne R Johnson | 14 | 10155546590851509_10155546598621509 | Hillary's high road is closed due to extreme disrepair!Remember "Hillary" accepted the questions from Donna Brazile! This shows she has NO ethics, she continues lying and finger pointing. This is proof of her dishonest character and lack of integrity. Where is the honor in her shear willingness to cheat? Since she is incapable of standing for what is right on small issues like debate questions, how can we expect her to stand for American justice as president. It's all about her and it's all about lies
8 | Bartosz Sokołow | 4 | 10155546590851509_10155546603931509 | I feel sad for her because this woman deserves better, should be Elizabeth Warren not the most crooked woman in history of american politics Crooked Hillary Clinton, shame on you democrats for that choice, but then again system is so rigged it's hardly a suprise
9 | Jake Davidson | 7 | 10155546590851509_10155546614481509 | Here goes CNN trying to promote their network chairman, Hillary Clinton, to the office. Everyone knows of your lies now. It's all over for you.
10 | Samantha James | 3 | 10155546590851509_10155546648036509 | Best one yet!! CNN = Clinton News Network!!! Love it!!!! How true - couldn't be a truer statement!!!! And of course the FBI has to bring this to the citizens attentions....new emails....new evidence!!! Better than a cover up!!!!
11 | Thoai Nguyen | 1 | 10155546590851509_10155546600416509 | Jerry also recalled the first time she had sex. Ever heard of the Big Bang? ...Yup, right after the last time I had sex too
12 | Mimi Miller | 0 | 10155546590851509_10155546648631509 | Bless her heart she probably did not know about all of the FBI Investigations and how hrc colluded and committed election fraud to be the nominee. We could have had a true progressive not a neo-con .. that granny probably does not now .. God Bless her heart. This Great Granny is voting for greater good with #JillStein
13 | Jared Bock | 2 | 10155546590851509_10155546639781509 | Thank the Republican party for voting for equal rights for women and blacks. They also voted for ending slavery. Guess who voted against all three, you guessed it the Democrats
14 | Sheila Paige | 0 | 10155546590851509_10155546657911509 | PLEASE!!!!

15 | Richard Chadwell | 0 | 10155546590851509_10155546688211509 | All of those EVIL  trump supporters with daughters, wives, and mothers ,will just to have tell them after they are victimized that its just the way things are now in trumps new society, that allows men to have their way with women without any consequence!
16 | I Want Less Government And For The Congress To Stop Wasting Our Tax Dollars | 0 | 10155546590851509_10155546668586509 | Polling shows Clinton to be perceived as having a better temperament than Trump but Trump is perceived as being much more honest and trustworthy. So the choice is a calm liar or an exuberant straight shooter.
17 | Пол Уче | 1 | 10155546590851509_10155546634871509 | Today is Wednesday ,like this comment and you will get another Wednesday in seven days. It really works. One of my friend ignored it and he got Thursday in 24 hours😂😂😂
18 | Juan Lytle | 1 | 10155546590851509_10155546604541509 | Gotta love that lady! She's actually a good friend of my buddy's, and she knows being gay is a choice. But hey, go ahead and highlight her for hillarys benefit
19 | Chris Farris | 4 | 10155546590851509_10155546635651509 | Let's just clear up some facts.... Women were allowed to vote depending upon what state you lived in. Yes... Many states did not allow women to vote. It was the REPUBLICANS that pushed to give all women their right to vote. However, DEMOCRATS fought to keep women from voting. DO YOUR RESEARCH and get the facts right.
20 | Kevinjames Yasharahla Baldwin | 0 | 10155546590851509_10155546622136509 | My brothas and sistas of Israel Do not voteDeuteronomy 17:15 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the Lord thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother.Time to repent from the ways of Babylon. Let edom and the other nations vote. They were not given these laws but you were. The time is at hand. Of you know you're an Israelite I don't care if you're Northern Kingdom or Southern.
21 | Margaret Aikens | 0 | 10155546590851509_10155546664786509 | Clinton recieved 66 million dollars in what Joe Scarborough calls a sleazy shakedown scheme. “The Washington Post article is absolutely fascinating on ‘Bill Clinton Inc.,'” Scarborough said. “Sixty-six million dollars to him personally and they’re bragging. They’re bragging at the memo that they can shake down the same corporations that they’re taking donation money for, that they can shake them down for $66 million for ‘Bill Clinton Inc.'”
22 | Kimberly Henry | 0 | 10155546590851509_10155546684636509 | LMAO they are bringing out the vintage cobweb mothball pussy for HILLARY lmao the fact that she is 100 years old shows she was a racist dem when they founded the KKK way back when, she remembers when blacks couldn't vote  with out a test! And now she is gleeful that the dumb negroes are voting for the party that enslaved them! LOL
23 | Eileen Sullivan Tormey | 1 | 10155546590851509_10155546635366509 | WOW - again negative complaints instead of appreciating/respecting this woman's right to choose - she has lived more of a life that some you making such negative comments.......
24 | Carin Lynn | 0 | 10155546590851509_10155546621026509 | Shared: TRUMP >>>> A demagogue /ˈdɛməɡɒɡ/ is a leader in a democracy who gains popularity by exploiting prejudice and ignorance among the common people, whipping up the passions of the crowd and shutting down reasoned deliberation. Demagogues have usually advocated immediate, violent action to address a national crisis while accusing moderate and thoughtful opponents of weakness. Demagogues violate established rules of political conduct; most who were elected to high office changed their democracy into some form of dictatorship.Demagogues appealed directly to the emotions of the poor and uninformed, pursuing power, telling lies to stir up hysteria, exploiting crises to intensify popular support for their calls to action. Demagogues do these things relentlessly and without self-restraint.
25 | Tena Wood | 2 | 10155546590851509_10155546612256509 | Hillary Clinton knew all along that Anthony Weiner was sexting young girls and did nothing to stop it. She's known about it since 2011. Why didn't she go to the authorities with that information? I thought she cared about women and young ladies. She's a disgrace.

1 | Carolyn Ryden | 294 | 10155546447466509_10155546471296509 | I don't get why ppl have to be so f'n cruel with their comments. Just vote who you want as president and respect other ppl's choices regardless if both candidates are not the greatest. Bullying is getting to be at an all time high and then ppl wonder why kids are doing it too. Smh.
2 | Kevin Miller | 214 | 10155546447466509_10155546476051509 | I'm sorry to rain on your parade sweet old lady but Hillary's not a woman...she's a gender neutral cyborg created from splicing the  DNA harvested from the shittiest politicians of the last 50  years and  incubated in a wild pig....then hatched and dressed up in a pants suit and wig.
3 | David Perryman | 107 | 10155546447466509_10155546497121509 | It's most likely her first and last chance to vote for a female presidential candidate. She's welcome to do so, but the rest of us can wait for a woman who is actually qualified and fit to lead this nation.
4 | Gad Foltys | 59 | 10155546447466509_10155546474141509 | This is not a comment about this dear lady whom I have the utmost respect for, this is about the Incest of CNN and the ruling elite through the Clintons. A network of DECEPTION.
5 | Hans Neil | 70 | 10155546447466509_10155546466431509 | If you want a dark America... Vote Trump If you want a racist America... Vote TrumpIf you want a depressed America... Vote TrumpIf you want a discriminated USA... vote Trump.People with common sense and educated will never vote Trump. Smart people don't vote Trump.This country that I love so much can't have a misogynist, racist, narcissistic,  con man as president. Guys please let's get out vote Blue. You don't have to love Hillary just imagine a 4 years of Trump and how deep our country will be destroyed.
6 | Vanessa Patterson Woodard | 36 | 10155546447466509_10155546543186509 | Awww, bless her heart.  I can't imagine waiting over 103 years to be able to vote for a woman for President only to have Hillary Clinton as the choice.  I would love nothing more than to cast my vote for a woman but I think I'm going to just wait until the next one runs, so I can truly be proud of my vote.
7 | Melissa Lynn Marrero | 57 | 10155546447466509_10155546460776509 | When are you going to post on Donna Brazile getting fired for leaking the debate questions to Hill?? No wonder she was so well rehearsed. 😂😂 #cheater...or that the Clinton Foundation is also under FBI investigation? #corruption #PoorBernieGotRigged#wikileaks
8 | Rip Mcgill | 13 | 10155546447466509_10155546516191509 | CNN proved that its nickname, the Clinton News Network, is deserved. Only after WikiLeaks showed that Democratic Party honcho Donna Brazile, a paid commentator, twice gave Clinton debate questions in advance did the network sever its ties with her.Tellingly, Clinton never rejected the insider advantage against rival Bernie Sanders, nor seemed surprised by it. And CNN still shows no curiosity about whether anyone else participated in the scam.
9 | DA Brown | 13 | 10155546447466509_10155546558431509 | A lot of you on this thread have NO respect for your elders! I would never in a million years say to or about an elderly woman some of the things that you all have! Shame on you!
10 | Donna Burton | 12 | 10155546447466509_10155546489876509 | It boggles my mind how anyone could vote someone who is under an active federal criminal investigation into office. Not just one either but two, One for destroyed email evidence & the other for selling out this country in her Clinton pay to play schemes.
11 | Armand Ali | 21 | 10155546447466509_10155546465401509 | Like if you are a proud REPUBLICAN, but this time you are voting for HIllary in November because she is the only and best option! #Improudtobeanamerican
12 | Allyson Fleming Bauer | 3 | 10155546447466509_10155546583211509 | This is a very amazing and historical moment for this woman and for all women. No matter who you are voting for, I hope you can set aside political differences and opinions to just appreciate this for the sake of women's history.We have come a long way!
13 | Shannon McCall | 12 | 10155546447466509_10155546483211509 | And that's why we're made fun of and have had to fight a reputation...voting for President merely on their gender is ridiculous. Way to set us back some more.
14 | Natasha Hilliard | 5 | 10155546447466509_10155546578106509 | What an adorable woman! To still be able to stand on her own at 103 is amazing! And she seems very cognitive. I'm not a Hillary supporter, but I'm touched by this video.
15 | Ryan Mathis | 3 | 10155546447466509_10155546581331509 | Well I get the feeling that her vote would be casted for Hillary whether she was blessed to live as long as she has or not.
16 | George Blom | 2 | 10155546447466509_696553537174169 | She was born about 50 yrs after the abolitionists won out and Lincoln (a Republican) wrote the Emancipation Proclamation. I'll bet she doesn't know that. What she should know is that Democrats have set African Americans back 50 yrs. Democrats/Liberals rewrite history, they don't want you to know the truth. But go ahead m'am...  risk your first time vote on those who have lied to you. It's not you who will pay the price.
17 | Richard Alexander | 0 | 10155546447466509_10155546585566509 | It's like the people who are voting for Hillary are willfully ignorant or projecting the face of some bully they suffered onto Trump. I've heard a lot of mention of the word "Presidential" like it means something. When some of our best presidents were bombastic narcissists who were not career politicians. Hell Reagan was a b-list actor. The fact is all Donald Trump has done is say mean things and Hillary has done things worse than what we tried to impeach Nixon for. I know this lady was alive during watergate so what's her excuse? Hell this lady was alive for the president that literally went on Bigfoot hunts.

But Trump as an Republican choice , is no choice. My opinion...id vote for kaisch in a heartbeat.

21 | Ray Shields | 8 | 10155546447466509_10155546463361509 | CNN quietly cut ties with Donna Brazile, the acting Democratic National Committee chair and a longtime contributor on the cable news network, after hacked emails published by WikiLeaks revealed that she had provided questions to the Hillary Clinton campaign in advance of a town hall and debate hosted by CNN during the Democratic primary.Now your bringing what we thought was decent people down with you.So Bernie was cheated. Pay attention Hillary has lied to everyone. America is about honesty as a most basic principle. If your child lied this much what would you do. Certainly not elect them to the most powerful office in the world.
22 | Kieu Dung | 0 | 10155546447466509_10155546597026509 | 51 GOP leaders don't vote for Trump and called him step aside. (There is no similar phenomenon happened in Democracy party). Pope Francis critizes his immigration policy by suggesting he isn't Christian. Economists point out the stupidity of Trump's economic policies, especially public debt policies. 80 major journals endorse Clinton (zero for Trump), People in all countries (except only 1) vote for Clinton, 70 Nobel laureates strongly support Clinton.That’s enough !!!Don’t believe in unreliable source like wikileak, because anyone, including republicans, can tell lie to wikileak about Clinton. Nobody can check facts of wikileak. Furthermore, many people make fake websites and try to fool other people that that websites get information from wikileak. Don’t pay attention too much in details because they may be less important than you think.http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-widely-condemned-republican-leaders-legislators-n662446http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/19/world/americas/pope-francis-donald-trump-christian.html?_r=0http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-endorsements-newspaper-editorial-board-president-2016-2016-9/#houston-chronicle-these-are-unsettling-times-that-require-a-steady-hand-thats-hillary-clinton-4http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-poll-international-countries-uk-hillary-clinton-rcp-us-presidential-live-election-a7367591.htmlhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-nobel-laureates_us_5806f564e4b0dd54ce364558http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-preliminary-updatehttp://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-on-the-economy/http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-election-trump-un-idUKKCN12C0UF
23 | Mirishikiari Shou | 0 | 10155546447466509_10155546651016509 | Voting for a woman because she is a woman goes against the liberal mantra. Gender neutral, remember? This is hypocrisy at its finest, taking advantage of the elderly woman? Proof that liberals will take advantage of anyone for a vote. She shouldn't have worried though, even if she had died, she would still have voted for Hillary.

1 | Jack Sylvestre | 204 | 10155546347806509_10155546355291509 | Hey democraps...Bernie supporter here from canada, how does it feel to lose the election over donald trump 😂😂😂?  Democraps be like: hillary is winning in a landslide😂😂😂with Bernie, you would have easily beat Trump in a general according to many polls. Yet you allowed Hillary stole the nominee. Good luck!
2 | Shay Isra | 204 | 10155546347806509_10155546348711509 | Hillary Clinton spent over 9 YEARS as the 'First Lady of Arkansas' at a WHITES-ONLY country club, only leaving after Bill's opponent in the 1992 election criticized them for it.
3 | Brandon Horan | 218 | 10155546347806509_10155546351331509 | I fear that some day my son will ask me "Dad, why didn't you stop Trump from being president? Look at all of the terrible things he has done to our country and to the world."
4 | Roni Khochaba | 106 | 10155546347806509_10155546361536509 | People dont listen its not a tight race lol.... CNN why not tell everybody why you told Hilary Clinton Debate Questions before hand?  Lol shes losing trumps winning now. They wont tell you that, they just keep on lying even more smfh....
5 | Cl Frank | 174 | 10155546347806509_10155546357846509 | my family and I voted in tampa florida day today and will be for HILARY CLINTON, we decided that the best option is very experienced in politics, and looks to be a very strong woman.
6 | Jane Williams | 126 | 10155546347806509_10155546352266509 | Thank you to the battle states - please do not let our country end up in the hands of this woman who thinks she is above the law.
7 | Ernest Delesma Sr | 55 | 10155546347806509_10155546363076509 | Trump the pedophile will be in court a day after the elections,for his rape charge against a 12 yr old girl, and then for his fake Trump University.
8 | Shandy Elliott | 50 | 10155546347806509_10155546359081509 | So I wonder how CNN will word their headlines when Trump actually begins to lead more states. They keep using terms to suggest Trump is still behind (when at least they are tied and Trump is still gaining momentum). CNN will find a way to minimize Trump's lead.
9 | Debbie Watkis | 33 | 10155546347806509_10155546370051509 | So tired of CNN airing everyone of Trump's speeches.  Why aren't they talking about his upcoming rape trial and the ramification of the fraud trial?  Why has that disappeared from the news?
10 | Caitlin Hawkins | 25 | 10155546347806509_10155546367781509 | I can only imagine the dictatorship that will take place if Donald wins. So far he's suing everybody who disagrees with him. That's not quite how freedom of the press works buddy. You can only go after people for defamation of character, if it's false. Yet if it's true, it is what it is. There is more evidence of him ( through videos), acting  racist, sexiest, saying you can touch a woman everywhere when you're famous, etc... than there are of her. Arguing that her 30 years in leadership has been ineffective means you don't understand how our system works. She's one person, she can't change/run everything just because she's been around for 30 years. Look at Abraham Lincoln. How long did it take for change to take place during his life time? A pretty long time. Point being, the FBI didn't find what she did in the past to be illegal. They're looking at more info to see if it possibly has a connection. That's it. Doesn't make her guilty. Maybe a basic law 101 class would help some people understand. Wiki links feeds off of  conspiracy theorist and dooms day folks. I'm for her!
11 | Jan Hobbs Chapman | 34 | 10155546347806509_10155546354466509 | I voted Monday ... straight ticket Republican!  Hillary needs to withdraw from the race now!!  No one in their right mind would vote for someone that is under FBI investigation!!  Hillary is corrupt, she is a liar, she is pure evil!!  She is a disgrace to the USA!!  #hillaryforprison #neverhillary
12 | Alec Drake | 21 | 10155546347806509_10155546363856509 | Hillary will win Nevada. Trump will not be able to overtake her early vote advantage and they always under poll that state. Hillary will also win pennsylvania. That state has never been in play. The real story is Florida. If Hillary wins Florida, it is over.
13 | Doug Petersen | 10 | 10155546347806509_10155546450346509 | So CNN believes WikiLeaks enough to fire Donna Brazile but doesn't trust the ones about Hillary Clinton? WikiLeaks is doing your job for you CNN. They have never had to retract any of their information. They are 100 % accurate.
14 | Troy McLaren | 3 | 10155546347806509_1260720560657605 | DID YOU THINK THAT HILLARY HAD A BAD FRIDAY WITH FBI? ...

16 | Liz Uribe | 2 | 10155546347806509_10155546444346509 | According to multiple sources, after the NYPD confiscated Anthony Weiner's laptop which was filled with Huma Abedin's emails they continued their search and discovered the property of Hillary Clinton in the form of emails that implicated her and Bill in the most heinous and serious crimes.  An NYPD source just claimed that within the emails on that device, Hillary and Bill are directly implicated ins a MASSIVE child sex/trafficking ring along with their friend, and convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. According to the source, “…It’s much more vile and serious than classified material on Weiner’s device. The emails DETAIL the trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary on their pedophile billionaire friend’s plane, the Lolita Express.” “We’re talking an international child enslavement and sex ring“ These claims were backed up by other NYPD sources as well: Jeff Epstein is a level-3 registered sex offender and the media ignores the fact hat Bill Clinton flew 26 times on Epstein’s private Jet and allegedly visited Epstein’s sex slave island. Now that Hillary has also been directly implicated, the media cannot ignore this any longer! The NYPD source makes specific claims about her involvement. He says, “Hillary has a well documented predilection for underage girls, and Mr. Weiner could not bear to see those details deleted.” http://redstatewatcher.com/article.asp?id=46461
17 | Kenneth Charles Frye | 0 | 10155546347806509_1786066914972365 | But hey maybe she'll have better luck tomarrow. Isn't that right you Hillary Clinton supporters. Now I ask you. Where's that big talk that Hillary will win by such a big landslide? Jeez, look at me I'm so scared. No not a landslide! Anything but a Hillary supporter lying, but hey you guys learned from the best huh. I didn't buy it then, but try it now I might drink "the kool-aid". Seriously tell me how much this landslide is on a mass scale.This is going to be great.
18 | Dmitriy Mir | 1 | 10155546347806509_1260721783990816 | Now Trump wants to sue everyone against him.. Can you imagine this jerk with nuclear cods and someone like President of Philippines calls him SOB. As he stated ones "bomb sh.. out of them". Well.. And everyone from Trump supporters group says if Clinton gets to the office it will be WW3.. I can't make any ends from statements of those idiots😂😂😂
19 | Robert Dunning | 5 | 10155546347806509_10155546361076509 | Wow "In Nevada, the poll suggests the race has also shifted, with Trump now ahead there 49% to 43%, with 5% behind Libertarian Gary Johnson, compared with a two-point Clinton edge in mid-October"
20 | Elizabeth Grilley | 2 | 10155546347806509_1260735937322734 | If you vote for Hillary Clinton you are a morally deranged subpar person. You know that she is a lying, corrupt, racist that has no soul. She is a rapist and pedophile. Her acts are treasonous and by supporting her you condone her actions.
21 | David Whitman | 0 | 10155546347806509_1786072518305138 | Donald J. Trump drain the swamp and the media bias, I used to like CNN "#reality show" because they were more in the middle on politics. Now I have to watch Fox news and MSNBC to get both sides policies. Journalism has become so lazy these days. Vice is probably the most legit journalism/news. The major news networks are not even a good source to put in an essay for school/college, because the news these day's come up with accusations and not facts backing there news articles or segments. SMH
22 | Larry Mason | 4 | 10155546347806509_10155546378261509 | The Republican and a Republican tea party Leaked information that was given to them by the FBI fact. Knowing that it would fool you into voting for them don't be there moron.
23 | Chibenthung Shitiri | 5 | 10155546347806509_10155546368126509 | I'm not from America but I feel pity for Americans that both their presidential candidates are not good but I feel that Trump is  lesser evil than Hillary. Hope trump wins.
24 | Roland Manny | 6 | 10155546347806509_10155546437311509 | I feel bad for Bernie Supporters! Trump wouldn't have a change to win but my fellow Democrats rigged the system and now we all going to suffer from it. Let's all admit it we lost this battle , we have criminal nominee and under FBI investigation and Trump is our next President. Let's all get used to calling him President Trump ~~Dem From PA.
25 | Silva Braga | 4 | 10155546347806509_10155546350986509 | It makes sense the appearance of a low-level candidate in the conspiracy against America headed by Putin, FBI, TRUMP, and considering the premature elimination of names moral standard in the previous party.

"I need everybody to understand that everything we've done is dependent on me being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things I believe in," President Obama said.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Allen Johnson | 2058 | 10155546214236509_10155546216511509 | That's the point!  We don't want the same things you believe in.
2 | Sean Hill | 1103 | 10155546214236509_10155546220021509 | So, I am reading that Hillary is really upset that the FBI is "dumping" on her right before the election.... I want to say to Mrs. Clinton, "So Hillary, how does it feel to be aborted 8 days before delivery?"
3 | Laurie Jarosz Berger | 695 | 10155546214236509_10155546220366509 | That's the whole point... to undo Pres. Obama's "legacy"...failed legacy.
4 | Jonathan Vera | 314 | 10155546214236509_10155546225021509 | That's a good thing for all americans! Obamas "legacy" has America on the edge of financial collapse put us in a sinkhole in the middle east and is poking a nuclear superpower we need a serious change of direction
5 | Shawn Tyler | 216 | 10155546214236509_10155546221501509 | As a Black Voter, Trump has no reason to have my vote. Anyone who wants to bring back Stop and Frisk is not for people of color.Edit: I upset a ton of Trump Supporters😂😂😂
6 | Rob Layton | 194 | 10155546214236509_10155546215726509 | A new email released by Wikileaks as part of the Podesta dump features Hillary ally Wendy Bronfein advising Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta on how to reach “f**king dumb” young people.Marketing executive Bronfein tells Podesta that Clinton “may not be the best face” to attract younger voters and that she needs to utilize “trending figures” as par of an “infusion to pull younger voters” because “that’s the crap that young people pay attention to”.Bronfein goes on to state, “It’s f**king dumb but being “cool” counts for more than it maybe should.”She references Bill Clinton’s saxophone playing as an example of this before asserting, “I hate to generalize a generation but by social media nature, they “follow”. So if someone they identify as cool endorses – they will likely fall in line with that candidate.”
7 | Steve Christy Smith | 164 | 10155546214236509_10155546234961509 | Obama you have not done anything for your own black people that you are calling out this morning you are the worst president ever complete moron Obama health care black and white people can't afford it
8 | Alec Drake | 226 | 10155546214236509_10155546222771509 | I'm voting bright and early for Hillary on November 8. I think Obama has been a great president and want to build on the progress he has made. Hillary is the candidate who will do it. She is also qualified for the job unlike the orange man.
9 | Moses Karugaba | 179 | 10155546214236509_10155546240356509 | What Legacy? Am a real BLACK MAN, i could even call myself a monkey, my brother, we say it was better while we waited for you to become president of the USA, You come, we become happy, we saw, we found nothing but love for Gays not Blacks, now we have nothing to look forward to in you and your legacy. We are going into the Donald J. Trump train, atleast we know its going somewhere!! Go and rest!
10 | NaTasha King-Welsch | 109 | 10155546214236509_10155546238766509 | I already voted for her!!! And not because she's a woman, not because President Obama said so, not because I'm black. But because she's the most qualified!
11 | Jamie Renee | 88 | 10155546214236509_10155546235551509 | His legacy involved multiple lies, the worst healthcare plan in the world, the worst race relations in 50 years, the most abusive government known and the unaffordable care act. We don't want his beliefs, we want someone who has their own beliefs.
12 | Joseph Patrick | 53 | 10155546214236509_10155546227681509 | The only one bringing down your legacy is hillary, Obama. You are in charge of your own fait and what they will say about you in the history books... did you pull out your support before the inditement or did you support the biggest career criminal in US history.
13 | John Plunk | 45 | 10155546214236509_10155546260936509 | He couldn't have been more truthful, if you want four more years of Obama, vote Clinton. If you would like to see some changes made in Washington D. C., vote Trump !
14 | Blessed M. Frank | 43 | 10155546214236509_10155546263746509 | And what are his legacies?The brutal murder and miming of blacks?the championing of same sex marriage across the world?Or maybe the fueling of terrorism in Syria?The toppling of legitimate government in Libya and Egypt?Obama should buried his face In shame, he's a big disgrace to the Africans.
15 | Keith Roberts | 28 | 10155546214236509_1830772277136638 | Legacy...hmmm..a failing healthcare system...funding terrorist and destabilizing the middle east...supporting dissension and racial division in the U.S. ....allowing unvetted immigrants with radical Islamic views to permeate our society...Yes Mr. Obama. We need to destroy that legacy!!
16 | Justin Perry | 20 | 10155546214236509_1830773870469812 | So it's ok for Obama to say this to black voters but if a white president said this to white voters about Obama than it would be racist and we would get the pitch forks out... But here we go the only thing Obama did was Obama care and it sucks...
17 | Louis Griffin | 15 | 10155546214236509_10155546237671509 | North Carolina African Americans must not care about the Obama legacy.or the progress made in the last 8 years. Because early voting is down 5% for African Americans in NC..
18 | Kimberly Crocker Hilgendorf | 11 | 10155546214236509_1783717418559711 | What legacy is that?  The legacy that left African Americans in worse shape than they were when you took office?  The legacy that 5.5 million more people are living in poverty since you took office?  The legacy that you took on more debt in your 8 years compared to all the other presidents combined?  The legacy of a failed Obamacare that cost tax payers billions and now premiums are skyrocketing?
19 | Jon Klock | 16 | 10155546214236509_1761676010748655 | Thats right folks, Obama needs to pass the baton to someone who believes in .....FrackingBig pharmaTppNaftaDomaCitizens unitedOffshore drillingElection fraudArms deals with dictatorsRepeal of glass steagal&dont forget all those drone bombs landing on innocent people!Great job America!
20 | Theo William | 16 | 10155546214236509_1761676367415286 | President Obama has been a good President, no matter what the ignorant people below have to say! It's hard to pass laws that actually benefit the American people when Republican Congress refuses to work with him, But ignorant people blame him. To become a country that becomes a leading power like the rest of world, like Denmark, Sweden, we need equality, like those countries have. Not turn back the clock to the Middle Ages!
21 | Warren Walker | 13 | 10155546214236509_1761676577415265 | That is why smart Americans are voting for Trump because he will undo as much of the Obama damage that he can and Hillary will continue the destruction.  Hopefully the smart Americans out number the dumb Americans by millions so we don't have a murdering lying old hag in the White House to hasten the down fall of America.  Vote Trump on Nov. 8th to save America from destruction.
22 | Kody Morrell | 22 | 10155546214236509_10155546233306509 | Obamacare is a disaster! Anyone voting for a continuation of his policies are hanging a burdeonsome debt around the neck of millions of Americans who cant afford it. Shame on you CNN for trying to campaign for the liberal left. You are disgusting.
23 | ChrisTeri Austin | 11 | 10155546214236509_10155546263461509 | HRC is AGAIN exploiting women to divert our attention from her second FBI investigation. First, her mess is her fault!. She used a private e-mail server/ unsecure server. It's not the fault of FBI Comey, Russia, or China. HRC destroyed subpoenaed evidence. That is a felony! The FBI knows it. The Media knows it. The public knows it. It is not a matter of IF she is guilty. It's a matter of WHY isn't she being tried and convicted, now? Now the Obama's are flying around on air force one endorsing a felon, avoiding REAL issues. Will Obama address the high premiums on his gov't insurance- Obamacare? The Clinton $slushfund$ Foundation to be investigated. None of that will be addressed in these last 6 days? HRC is yet to be held accountable! Instead, let's focus on Mr. Trumps words. Pathetic that Obama's and HIllary are promoting Sexism! Words Mr. Trump said or says do not compare to HRC corrupt criminal actions!  HRC really thinks she will be elected because she is a girl. No. As a female and mother of 3 grown loving and respectful sons I point out that HRC behaving like a conniving female. She is playing on women's emotions to avoid accountablility for her actions. HIllary used and hired women to spread rumors about Mr. Trump. (Debunked lies). HRC hires birddogs. Her camp trains, and pays people to start fights at Mr. Trumps rally's. People got hurt! That is evil. Wiki shows Podesta "dumping" e-mail. He tried to say it meant something else. Look at the timeline. A dump is a dump! Why don't they comment on all the other wiki "truth" e-mails! HRC is a liar. HRC is a cheater. (answers to the debate given to her-twice!) Double dip donations-she claims to support the LGBT family yet her big $ donor kills gay people- 2 faced HIllary!  HRC has blood on her hands. Benghazi. We have bigger concerns. A safe and secure nation for our kids and grandkids. HRC and Obama gave us ISIS. HRC should have her security clearance taken now! Your vote is a historical right to set things right. Corrupt polititians "You're Fired!" #TRUMP for President. USA!!
24 | Edwin Reyes | 10 | 10155546214236509_1761676390748617 | Barack Obama is the best President this country's ever had ! You white folks are 😡 mad because you're the new minority, you can't fit in in the new , progressive America , y'all feel left out don't y'all ! Hooray Obama, Hooray Hillary ! She's gonna beat the crap 💩 outta tRump and his deplorables !
25 | Jeanne Rogers | 11 | 10155546214236509_10155546254931509 | Thank God he wld undo your legacy cus it's a bad one! You shld be thankful that it's still somewhat repairable and he's willing to put back together what you have destroyed! Vote Trump

JUST IN: Police have captured the man sought after the ambush-style killings of 2 Iowa police officers
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Richard Stout | 394 | 10155546128101509_10155546132746509 | Captured alive🤔🤔They should've blown him up with the robot like they've done to others who kill law enforcement 🤔🤔🙄🙄But he was white so he can surrender peacefully after murdering 2 cops in cold blood 🙄🙄
2 | Femi J. Johnson | 249 | 10155546128101509_10155546135501509 | White on white crime,..this terrorist will be off the headlines & out of politics by tonight🙏🏿for the families
3 | George Thomas | 268 | 10155546128101509_10155546131826509 | So nice of them to capture this Trump supporter ALIVE. I wonder if they stopped and got him Burger King after.
4 | Katrina Young | 152 | 10155546128101509_10155546136411509 | Here is some irony for you. This guy was a confederate flag waving moron who despised people who protested against the national anthem and police brutality.
5 | Heather Jarrett | 124 | 10155546128101509_10155546135401509 | Disgusting. We're currently in a time in the US where it's common that police are killed, unarmed citizens are killed, wackjobs are running for president, and clowns are in our neighborhoods. I can't wait until 2017 because 2016 has been a strange year
6 | Jonathan Ogilvie | 131 | 10155546128101509_10155546139981509 | So - using the same rules the Trump folks use - every person who agrees and believes like this guy does is a terrorist.If every BLM protester is a terrorist because of the actions of a few - if every BLM protester is a cop killer because of the actions of an even tinier few...Then every white conservative confederate-flag lover is a terrorist. These are your rules, folks. Time to live by them. Don't like it, change your attitude. Until then, you believe like this guy, champion the same causes, you're a terrorist.Enjoy.
7 | Charlie Brockington | 115 | 10155546128101509_10155546157696509 | glad they caught that muslim terrorist! or wait he was a mexican illegal immigrant, wait he was an inner city violent black man! oh wait he was just a random joe shmo white guy! my bad! carry on! no talkin point here!
8 | Malcolm Xavier | 76 | 10155546128101509_10155546158966509 | White cop killer, what you racists gotta say now?? Yes white people are capable of capital murder and premeditated murder against police officers. I wonder if the cops will feel "threatened" next time they pull a white person over. I'm glad the killer was white just to prove that all races are capable of violence. White people kill too. Stop blaming us blacks for everything.
9 | Cl Rich | 62 | 10155546128101509_10155546143771509 | It's called an ambush when civilians do it, yet when police did it to a 12 year old child it was called justified??? Absolutely ridiculous. It all needs to stop. Gun reform and police accountability reform are needed. If we continue to do nothing, it will continue to escalate.
10 | Christopher Levy | 88 | 10155546128101509_10155546131886509 | I bet everyone thought and expected it was gonna be a black guy.
11 | Mike Boucher | 50 | 10155546128101509_10155546160671509 | White guy wanted for killing TWO cops, taken alive. Black man reaches for ID, shot dead in front of his child. This is the story that distracts you from the government corruption
12 | Jalen Foster | 30 | 10155546128101509_10155546188981509 | Just so y'all know. This right here is EXACTLY what black people are talking about. This is why Colin Kaepernik is doing what he's doing. This is why #BlackLivesMatter exists. This is why when a black person is killed by police officers, black people are outraged.This dude KILLED, MURDERED, 2 cops. The headline?? "Suspect in Custody". He was arrested after he had killed 2 police officers. I would call him a serious threat wouldn't you?? Yet, you see a black teen or grown man trying to run away or selling CDs/cigarettes he gets 10 slugs in the back??
13 | Ted Bennett | 25 | 10155546128101509_10155546204291509 | so, I was on the original article and people said "we all know who is responsible" and "thanks BLM!"So, where are ya now?  *crickets*Shocker that he got taken alive.You're more worried about phantom threats than the things that are actually destroying your Country.Thoughts to the families of the fallen Officers.
14 | Ford N Pierre | 27 | 10155546128101509_10155546131211509 | R.i.p officers 🙏 ill pray pray for the families infected by this tragedy Earlier Y'all was saying it's a black person that did It rush to judgment shame
15 | Caitlin Hawkins | 15 | 10155546128101509_10155546218291509 | If this guy was black he would have been shot on the spot, and for people to think Donald Trump is going to support blacks, that's a HUGE lie. He's going to protect law enforcement and bring back " law and order" , as he said in the debate. Nothing will change with him in office.
16 | Raymond Perez | 23 | 10155546128101509_10155546164406509 | What is the media going to call him? Terrorist?Radical White Terrorism?But of course, like every attack that is done by a white person. To the media, he just has mental problems.
17 | Bakari Wright | 12 | 10155546128101509_10155546209881509 | Fact: He's been captured alive so now the media will promote his background, likes, favorite foods, family, past history, etc.
18 | Terrence Alexander | 12 | 10155546128101509_10155546201631509 | Where's the outrage (from Trump) about this homegrown Caucasian terrorist (waiting for the mental health excuse)that murdered 2 cops?If he was Muslim,minority or illegal Trump and his surrogates would have been all over the place talking about ISIS,inner city criminals or illegal immigrants.R.I.P. to the murdered cops and prayers go out to their loved ones.Again more blood on the hands of the NRA this time the blood of 2 cops.
19 | Jeremy Wright | 10 | 10155546128101509_10155546251841509 | Look, we shouldn't be surprised here. For generations white people have had the same mentality. "Give us our way or we will murder you." This guy was escorted out of a stadium for antagonizing and harassing black people so he got mad and targeted police officers. That's called terrorism and it's not new to the European way of doing things.
20 | Laci Davidson | 2 | 10155546128101509_10155546263361509 | I really enjoy CNN however this is disheartening, yesterday a man in Cedar Rapids Iowa was shot , unarmed , by a police officer during a routine traffic stop. The story from the cops doesnt make sense. He is fighting for his life as I type this but only this story is of a guy killing 2 cops is reported on. Is it not news worthy if someone doesn't die, that is disgusting. Born and raised in Iowa and am truly saddened by what has happened this week in Iowa's 2 largest cities, also saddened that there is no justice at this time or call to attention for the man who is fighting for his life.
21 | Hi Lei Mary | 9 | 10155546128101509_10155546205401509 | Wow!! I truly hate it for the officers families.  But the news media loves stirring the racial pot! Now had the murderer been Muslim or Black his photo would be plastered all over every media site and TV news station. Calling the Muslim a Terrorist and the Black Man a BLM supporter or a Thug before any actual FACTS could be determined!
22 | Mary Janee | 12 | 10155546128101509_10155546146701509 | In custody but an unarmed black man dead hands up dead ! Sorry POS should of shot him dead color doesn't matter in reality people are sick never know whats going on in there sick mind
23 | Keith Kittrelle | 3 | 10155546128101509_10155546227006509 | The cops in Iowa probably called the Charleston cops Burger King meal for the church murderer and raised them a Ruth Chris steak dinner for the Iowa cop killer! #justagameofpokertothem!
24 | Brandon Robillard-Webb | 1 | 10155546128101509_10155546361341509 | Instead of intellectual  problem solving conversation. We play the blame game and the labeling game, we pull out our race cards  is this terrorism or just violence? Regardless, two police officers are dead. Like it has been said about Americans, " America will not be destroyed by some outside attacker, it's far too strong and resilient for that...no, America will be destroyed from the inside by elected leaders, corporations and fruitless bickering."
25 | August Relf | 3 | 10155546128101509_10155546297561509 | Check the last article they posted about this and read all the black bashing racist idiots talk about "BLM", "thugs" and "black on black crime" now I have a question......How do you feel now? The time spent stepping on eggshells ends now it's time to call America what it is, a nation born of hate and terror can only be called one thing HELL!!!

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Andrew Najda | 756 | 10155545913781509_10155545921551509 | Hey CNN,Why dont you instead report on Peter Kadzik, a high ranking DOJ official giving Hillary Clinton a heads up about upcoming events related to the Clinton email case.To which John Podesta responds: Additional chances for mischief.Kadzik was also a dinner guest of Podesta and his wife, Mary, on Oct. 23, 2015.So not only is Loretta Lynch compromised, but also her right hand. https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/43150
2 | Roland Manny | 470 | 10155545913781509_10155545921571509 | CNN loves to put out fake news!.. let's start with CNN and the rest of alphabets medias.
3 | Beverly Ann | 672 | 10155545913781509_10155545922291509 | Suck a slong CNN. You're the most biased lying rag of a news source out there. You're going down with Killery for you role in getting her the debate questions and answers. I can't wait until Trump takes office and denies you any interviews!
4 | Jacob L. Wilkerson | 273 | 10155545913781509_10155545941371509 | you're washed up cnn.. people are going other places because they don't trust you anymore. and after the elections, your ratings will show it, trust me
5 | Han Sohlo | 210 | 10155545913781509_10155545944696509 | They don't call it the Clinton News Network for nothing! How about all the fabricated fake news against Trump, like saying that he has ties to Russia, when in fact the Clinton Foundation is the one that received a "donation" from them. Why doesn't CNN say anything about that?
6 | Tammy Lynn | 163 | 10155545913781509_10155545936151509 | As opposed to the fake news spread by the mainstream media? If we could trust the msm these little 'fringe' sites would hold no water. they might post some bs info, but if you're smart enough to see through that you will find real legit info as well.
7 | Donna Campos | 147 | 10155545913781509_10155545961191509 | Now this is funny!!! CNN wants to tell us about lies in the Media?!?! Hannity has CNN beat, in accuracy, when it comes to Fact-Checking! hahaha You have got to be kidding me - Do some real reporting (if possible) on the Clinton Corruption that are all backed up with facts.
8 | Dave Weaver | 133 | 10155545913781509_10155545943606509 | CNN Clinton News Network is a fake news media bought and paid for by the DNC.Wonder where you will be working in a couple of weeks?
9 | Bill Right | 114 | 10155545913781509_10155545935206509 | I would trust PeeWee Herman sitting behind me in a movie theater while out on a date with O J Simpson, drinking at Bill Cosby's bar with Flint Michigan ice cubes, all while Casey Anthony babysits for me before I would trust HER to walk my dog!!!
10 | Mitch Cox | 43 | 10155545913781509_10155546004701509 | My timeline is filled with trumptards posting fake news stories and not only believing them to be true but getting furious over some of them! And the thing is that it's sooo obvious that they're fake but since it fits their agenda they automatically believe it. Which is one reason why there are so many right winged extremist nut jobs running around. You can literally make them believe ANYTHING!!
11 | John Lair | 36 | 10155545913781509_10155545951746509 | CNN spreads the most fake stories while ignoring real ones. Bill Clinton denies calling Obamacare crazy; CNN ignores it; where's the reality check?
12 | Larry Reeves Underwood | 37 | 10155545913781509_10155545951326509 | Anything to take the attention off your creating news before it happens. Pathetic excuse of a news story. The main difference is he thought he was doing the right thing. CNN decided to cheat and rig the system.
13 | Toby Bee | 30 | 10155545913781509_10155545959416509 | Why don't you people report on the Hillary scandals.....You avoid all of them and continue to promote the most dishonest candidate in American history- Hell No Hillary !
14 | Leland Moulton | 42 | 10155545913781509_10155545930426509 | CNN LYING Bias MEDIA It's called political correctness and it's been used to rob a nation blind, Trump broke through because he's been in the spotlight for decades and knows their game, he told you this in the beginning, the media had been used as a tool to destroy the character of anyone who challenged this juggernaut, now it's time for payback
15 | Sandy Hafenbrack | 15 | 10155545913781509_10155546065011509 | The real problem is that viewers and listeners of people like Hannity and Limbaugh hear this fake news crap and take it as gospel then base their vote on all these lies and misinformation. They don't hear the retraction or if they do they won't even believe it. Misinformed voters is what will cause the fall of us as a country and society not Hillary's emails.
16 | Jon Fryett | 20 | 10155545913781509_10155546034391509 | CNN is the King of fake stories....you have no room to talk. Some of the Dem wackos are saying Comey, Trump, and Russia are rigging the election. When the tables turn on the Dems, they go into ultra-Lying mode. Hurry....they need a Trump distraction to pull it off.  What can they make up next....the Dems/Clinton campaign? They are getting desperate folks. Hillary, her campaign, and Foundation are all based on lies and corruption. Who wants a leader with all this excessive baggage from day one? I sure don't.....she didn't get my vote thank God.
17 | Evan Dickens | 15 | 10155545913781509_10155545994816509 | Umm, Michelle Obama did delete all tweets since 2013. Go look on twitter. Still deleted. Also, @michelleobama doesn't currently follow @hillaryclinton. Are y'all pitching this whole thing as fake? Someone at CNN was told to make this story and make it quick.
18 | Michael Jerson | 15 | 10155545913781509_10155545979826509 | So if CNN covered both the good and bad of both candidates in a fair and balanced way, neither side would have to look elsewhere for real news. Funny how that works CNN....
19 | Felix Atene | 11 | 10155545913781509_10155546021836509 | But that's a typical Republican tactic, say something inflammatory and after a day or two apologize mockingly. Release unsubstantiated news then, again, wait a few days and apologize with a big grin on their face.
20 | Neva Tapia | 9 | 10155545913781509_10155546020506509 | CNN, how dare you do your job and report the FACTS to us!! Trump supporters don't believe facts and everyone on here nagging CNN as being "fake" OBVIOUSLY didn't read the article!! Imagine that!! Sean Hannity himself corrected himself and apologized, but I'm definitely not surprised that Trump supporters believe anything that isn't on Fox News!!
21 | Amy Flores | 10 | 10155545913781509_689426621223513 | Attention Trump voters: Whether Trump wins or loses. We will NEVER watch CNN on tv or visit their website again. You behaved like pure biased trash this election season. Let's cause a ratings nightmare for the Clinton News Network. You're done.
22 | David Gleason | 3 | 10155545913781509_689425451223630 | Well you can't blame him; it's hard to keep up with all the lies, rumors, and conspiracy theories conservatives have been heaping on Hillary for the past couple of decades. #imwithher
23 | Joe Covert | 4 | 10155545913781509_10155546010761509 | For all the anger towards CNN, there are an awful lot of people commenting. Quit giving the illusion that facts are in dispute simply because you don't believe them. #ReadABook
24 | Victor Lawless | 8 | 10155545913781509_10155546032646509 | The only reason I even have a CNN newsfeed on facebook is to monitor the extreme bias your news service cannot seem to stay away from. You people spend more time with your lopsided 'reporting' for the benefit of a left wing liberal ideology then you do for the objective truth. CNN is as addicted to bias as a crackhead is to crack!  Sean Hannity is not even a reporter, he's a talk show host. Rather than focusing on a subject who is obviously diametrically opposed to CNN/s world view , why not do your jobs and investigate the allegations concerning the two candidates running for the office of president of the United States? At least half the people in this nation think Hillary Clinton is a criminal, now why is it CNN doesn't know why?
25 | Steve Balayewich | 7 | 10155545913781509_10155546061126509 | Cnn so busy trying to cover up the news they dont actually cover it any more.  Shame we have to rely on groups like wiki leaks and anonymous to drag the news out into the light. Main stream media bought and paid for. R.I.P. journalism

Ice levels at the North Pole have shrunk to their second-lowest level ever, scientists say -- and there could be worse to come http://cnn.it/2fdyNYq
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dennis Kraft | 115 | 10155545540581509_10155545634926509 | These comments are so disturbing. Wake up people. We are causing the earth to heat up, the ocean levels to rise, and it's going to be catastrophic. Unfortunately those of you who deny facts (and the rest of us too) will fall victim to this when its too late.
2 | Justin Mussel | 164 | 10155545540581509_10155545582991509 | You know what else is shrinking CNN , your ratings. The Clinton news network doesn't know how to report news that matters

Put up an article that everyone can get behind and can learn how to realistically help our environment. Not all of us live in the North Pole like CNN.

If they hated CNN this much ? Why are you still here ? Why not just unfollow them and find another news station to harass ?  Just my opinion folks !! Have a good day !!
5 | Craig Osborne | 27 | 10155545540581509_10155545576026509 | Let's ignore immediate threats to our survival! Like Muslims spreading like a cancer across the globe, like Iran with a nuclear weapon, like Russia and China strengthening their country's while we are teaching our kids to be politically correct, gender neutral safe spacers. Like isis growing and spreading. And let's focus on hypothetical things like global warming, which may kill us in 5000 years? Yes that seems logical. Good job CNN!!!!!

Global warming is here and apparently going at a faster rate then expected....lets pray its not too late to fix this problem and heal our planet!
8 | Tom Thompson | 11 | 10155545540581509_10155545587056509 | Every summer the trees reduce the overall CO2 concentration. If the planet heats up there will be more trees consuming more CO2 which will eventually lead to a reduced level of CO2 which will lead to planet cooling. Natures balance.

10 | Caleb Notz | 6 | 10155545540581509_10155545671386509 | All while the ice at the south poll has been growing and this is a natural cycle. I for one don't deny humans impact on the Earth, however I do question those who jump to conclusions just to get a reaction out of the public. Every time they talk about the climate changing they only talk about the last 20k years... Why is that? Well if you go back further the data starts to work against them. This is a natural cycle the Earth goes thro every 120k years as the Earth tilt angle changes. Remember folks, when they say most scientist agree on the data, most scientist at a time also used to think the Earth was flat and the center of the universe...*edit-phone can't spell lol *

13 | Amreena Qureshi | 3 | 10155545540581509_10155545876756509 | What we have done to the planet as humans is absolutely criminal. But the amount of damage that just the United States is causing is more then criminal, these corrupt politicians, big business men, the Koch brothers and others like him deserve the death penalty. They know our planet is dying, but because of corporate greed and financial increase they are pretending like it doesn't even exist.

15 | Charles Duane Tharp | 0 | 10155545540581509_10155546308361509 | BS. It's a natural geological cycle. The earths rotation (wobbling) on its axis changes each year therefore the Northern tip spends more time in the da creating a warmer climate. It's expected. Anyone whose studied nautical navigation is aware of this. And also the earth is closest to the Sun in the winter. How's that for a science lesson.
16 | Kendall Turnage | 1 | 10155545540581509_10155546140566509 | One super volcano or meteorite impact could happen tommorrow, block the sun and have everyone freezing at anytime.

18 | Edward Priebe | 0 | 10155545540581509_10155545619831509 | Science has been wrong so many times in the past and they are still doing more harm than good so let's get ride of science and see if the ice returns. My bet is the world banned chemicals our gov is using to sell their climate change business is building up in our water just like our soil and pretty soon they are going to change the freezing temp of water to An actual neg temp instead of 32 deg.
19 | Alex San | 0 | 10155545540581509_10155545796871509 | You could be a denying Republican paid by fossil fuel to deny man made climate change or listen to scientific evidence about man made climate change. It's not a political side noone wins if we cause destruction to our only planet.
20 | Joseph Kimrey | 1 | 10155545540581509_10155545598711509 | If we have constant video record of our planet, why not show us time lapse video, instead of truncating animation?When police want to prove their case, they present video evidence...not animation of their claims.

"Dude, you live in a tower with your name on it in gold," Stewart said about Donald J. Trump's claims that the system is rigged against him. "How well would you be doing if the man wasn't keeping you down?"

3 | Ken Barkhuff | 1095 | 10155545453316509_10155545469371509 | Trump has never said the man was keeping him down. He's said the election is rigged, and he's right. Numerous cases of voter fraud in Tx, Fl and Oh. And when did John Stewart become a political "science" study?
4 | Jim Gavin | 493 | 10155545453316509_10155545458396509 | This is unbelievable. Americans should be outraged that the media and Hiliary have taken away one of our most important fundamental rights The right to vote. By Hiliary accepting these questions she has rigged the election and should immediately be disqualified. FORGET WHO GAVE HER THE QUESTIONS..SHE TOOK THEM IS THE ISSUE.

9 | Matt Brown | 92 | 10155545453316509_10155545504941509 | CNN, you have lost all credibility with your handling of this election. You had someone who worked for you that gave debate questions to Clinton, and have showed nothing but one sided propaganda. The American public deserves more from their media. We don't have to like Trump to see how much BS you feed us. The real loser is the American people who deserve to be told the truth.

And y'all complaining about some illegitimate emails... and believe he's best to run the country with no experience and doing things like that.. yeah no.
12 | Jacob Fassold | 40 | 10155545453316509_10155545475136509 | Jon Stewart does not understand. The system is rigged and the definition of electoral college vote should be easily questioned, a felon running for office is proof, the FBI bending laws to fit a candidate like Hillary is proof it's rigged, the White House is for sale and it's been proven.
13 | Fred Wallick | 15 | 10155545453316509_1098893533559376 | I have to laugh at those Trump supporters who do NOT care about ANYTHING with regards to Trump, but THINK they are so very well versed on Hillary Clinton. Its really quite funny! LMAO..!
14 | Sean Boyles | 16 | 10155545453316509_10155545485851509 | Political system being rigged and the business system being rigged are 2 completely different things.

15 | Matthew Snyder | 16 | 10155545453316509_10155545479776509 | What does Trump's living situation have to do with democrats colluding with mainstream media outlets, hiring people to incite violence at GOP events, and committ voter fraud?
16 | Donna Campos | 11 | 10155545453316509_10155545506606509 | This idiot has been extraordinarily successful at fooling a lot of people with his antics. He is a master manipulator, a liberal political hack who has done very well at spreading his garbage. People willing put their brains to sleep as he influences their political views towards liberalism, and pretty much lowering their IQ in regards to all things political. The "Daily Show has nothing more than a "low-information" audience.
17 | Sam J Marquez | 9 | 10155545453316509_552448431625218 | The American people are on to this garbage it's disgusting. Drain the swamp already especially with these celebrities who are showing their true faces... it's the little people that made them rich and successful
18 | John Roscoe | 6 | 10155545453316509_10155545497476509 | Though I am not a Trump supporter, and fully acknowledge that Trump is putting on a petulant child act, Stewart here is purposely being naive and ignorant simply to bolster his own position. The context in which Trump alleges that things are rigged against him is a purely political system context. Stewart of course knows this, but purposely warps it because he's just another one of those comedians who decided all the money is in putting on the "I'm a witty Liberal comedian" routine. I'm nominally a Democrat, but this crap gets on my nerves. Him, Samantha Bee, their ilk. Be a comedian or be a pundit. Don't put on a false act of being both just to pander, when anyone with half a brain knows it's nothing but an act and their true convictions are unknown.
19 | Christos Terzan | 11 | 10155545453316509_10155545510081509 | CNN shame, shame, shame. Who's rats are jumping ship and pleading the fifth? Report on NEWS, please.Loretta Lynch, Clintons IT people, see that wasn't hard, I'm not even a journalist. Just a hard working Ex-Felon lower class auto mechanic trying to find truth amongst all the mud slinging on both sides. I broke the law and paid the price, now give me some real news and maybe your credibility can be restored, until then, pull down your skirt, your bias is showing.
20 | Tim Huber | 11 | 10155545453316509_10155545490696509 | Trump is talking about the election system and the media being rigged.Wow...some people on the left are ignorant at best.
21 | Louis Barraco | 6 | 10155545453316509_10155545556416509 | This came from the Advocate (our local paper) and I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump.  The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."
22 | Vickie Ellen Gildea McCrabb | 11 | 10155545453316509_682725465228093 | Well to all you people posting here about how the system is rigged...unless he wins..explain that logic to me..sore losers before the game is even over...says so much about you and you're...hero..smh
23 | Bern P Haines | 6 | 10155545453316509_682731048560868 | Some people like John epitomises the reasons why Americans are not like the rest of  us, we don't accept this kind of barbaric elections and this means as the superpower is over soon our world takes a bad turn. Vote Hillary Clinton and we all go down.
24 | Gina Bailey Jones | 8 | 10155545453316509_552470041623057 | It boggles my mind how all these middle class folks think he's going to be looking out for them. It's going to be the biggest episode of "Punked" of all time if this joker is elected. We all know it's only rigged when he's losing.
25 | Fred Wallick | 14 | 10155545453316509_682722911895015 | How come Trump doesn't complain about that RIGGED system that allows him to NOT pay Federal Taxes the past 19 years? Are there any Trump supporters out there who are brave enough to answer that...?

2 | Matt Barth | 330 | 10155545361701509_10155545367116509 | I would rather have Aaron Hernandez drive me to go pick up Jodi Arias, so we can go on a fancy couples date with Ray rice and his fiancé, to Bill Cosby's bar that serves their drinks with Flint Michigan ice cubes and has Jeffery Dahmer cooking up bar food, all while Casey Anthony babysits my children, than have Hilary Clinton take my imaginary dog for a walk. #Trump2016#DrainTheSwamp
3 | Emeka Victor | 183 | 10155545361701509_10155545386471509 | So, I am reading that Hillary is really upset that the FBI is "dumping" on her right before the election.... I want to say to Mrs. Clinton, "So Hillary, how does it feel to be aborted 8 days before delivery?"
4 | Erusmus H. Torres | 119 | 10155545361701509_10155545374121509 | Somebody at CNN gave Donna Brazile the debate questions ahead of time. Are you investigating to find the person or persons?
5 | Shawn Conner | 122 | 10155545361701509_10155545386106509 | Remember when Trump was laughed at for saying Hillary had the questions ahead of time? Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.
6 | Nick Brinley | 73 | 10155545361701509_10155545373356509 | If Hillary had been truthful and open with the FBI (as she demands they be) from the beginning, she wouldn't be in this situation. She can cry all she wants, she has no one to blame but herself.
7 | Steve Genova | 30 | 10155545361701509_10155545423031509 | Lmao the FBI already admitted they had evidence the first time, how can Hillary say they have no evidence this time? Also Donald isn't retracting his statements on the FBI people, he is actually giving them credit for correcting the wrong doing they did the first time.
8 | Melanie D. Young | 32 | 10155545361701509_10155545374191509 | It doesn't matter what they said. The NYPD obviously found something very incriminating on Weiners computer regarding her that it warranted them to reopen the investigation against her. And if the rumors of what they found are true it's a doozy.
9 | Jeanie Solt | 24 | 10155545361701509_10155545399896509 | Just wait and see the bombshell that's coming out tomorrow about Hillary might give you a different respective on her crooked 30 year career in the white house and don't forget Bill Clinton he said yesterday that Obamacare was a disaster then he changed his story after he got caught in a lie he totally said he didn't say it look at the rally he spoke at yesterday in Florida
10 | Leland Moulton | 29 | 10155545361701509_10155545376751509 | CNN LYING BIAS MEDIA Trump is like the modern day Paul Revere!!

11 | Marc Leroux | 8 | 10155545361701509_10155545638826509 | Trump has lied, insulted, accused, harassed, made fun of the disabled, went directly against minorities, is endorsed by the KKK, and much more. Hillary has an email deleting scandal and the trump supporters are going crazy. What a bunch of sheep following their clueless master. As someone from outside looking in, your great country will fall at an alarming rate if Trump is elected.
12 | Steve Appleby | 6 | 10155545361701509_10155545457511509 | ok lets just say Hillary wins, if the republicans take control of congress. she will have the most MISERABLE presidency ever. itll be worse than john adams. she will get NOTHING done.
13 | Frank Kwame Amoako-Atta II | 19 | 10155545361701509_10155545391476509 | Poor America. Such a tough choice to make between a man who's a liar, rapist, sexual predator, racist, bigot, misogynist, unpredictable narcissist and pussy grabber or a woman who used the wrong email

15 | Michael R Anderson | 6 | 10155545361701509_10155545450646509 | HEADLINES November 9th. Hillary loses election by a landslide. Hillary and press blame FBI Director Comey’s letter to congress.Let me tell you a little story and you decide it’s plausibility. So, a few months ago, FBI Director Comey tells congress he will not be seeking charges against Hillary. Why because he is a pro-Hillary fan and friend of the Clinton’s, while most Americans will admit, Hillary broke the law.A very large number of Americans believe the main-stream media is fixed behind Hillary. They feel the press are even willing to artificially inflate the numbers in the polls so more and more people will get behind her and to help continue the mega-billionaires to keep the money rolling in.In fact, if you compare the photos of Trump’s and Hillary’s rally’s, it is obvious Trump is filling football stadiums and Hillary is having a hard time filling high school gyms. One event was cancelled because only about 30 people showed up. What that means, is that Trump is winning by a landslide. Hillary knows she is losing. The press knows she is losing.What’s going to happen to the media and Hillary, if Trump does win by a land slide. It will be proof the media was lying by over inflating Hillary’s numbers. How can Hillary save face that mainstream America thinks she’s crooked and lost the election by a landslide? Moreover, how can the crooked media avoid being caught in their massive lies? Let’s go back to Comey for a moment. Eleven days before the election, Comey writes a letter to congress fully knowing the Republicans will leak it to the press, stating he wants to advise congress of this new twist in the email investigation against Hillary.Wow, that letter seems to have made the Democrats very mad as they believe the letter to likely be the single biggest reason Hillary lost the election, right? Well, maybe not. I say it’s all planned and here’s why I think that way:If Hillary loses, that makes her look bad and a mega-insult to her ego as well as to the Democratic party. It also proves the media was lying in polls showing Hillary was so far ahead of Trump.So, I have to ask, why did a pro-Hillary FBI Director release such a damaging letter? Think about it… Hillary loses the election by a landslide. Comey is actually helping Hillary with a plausible excuse for losing. Hillary can blame that letter from Comey to congress instead of facing the facts that America is tired of the direction the Democrats have taken our country.Wait for it…. What about the lying press? Well, if Hillary loses and loses big, the press too can point to Comey’s letter deflecting any thoughts of numbers rigging.In the Democratic party, Comey is a hero. Took one for the team. I’m confident there will be a place for Comey in the Clinton foundation somewhere.In the end, a Hillary loss will be a winner for both the Democrats and the press and American’s as a whole.
16 | Russell Tosh | 8 | 10155545361701509_10155545497716509 | Millions of Americans are now calling CNN the Clinton News Network this 24/7 Clinton campaign commercial pretending to not only to us but sadly themselves also to be journalist has become one of the biggest laughingstocks in America and now with the revelation they were funneling debate questions to Donna Brazile to give to Hillary how can anyone in their right mind even begin to take the Clinton News Network the least bit seriously ?!?!

18 | Linda Roy | 2 | 10155545361701509_10155545393361509 | All of us are using emails? But what is in the email message to talk about? Some people and media exaggerated the contents and the situation when there was nothing happened in American continent in relation to those emails. No attack that question the safety of Americans. Did you find something like that created chaos in national security in the email messages?Informations should be clear and don't confuse people to give judgment without knowing the truth. Some crooked minded people might use it as a tool to their political, personal and social advantage.
19 | Elizabeth Grilley | 0 | 10155545361701509_1821187408121220 | If you vote for Hillary Clinton you are a morally deranged subpar person. You know that she is a lying, corrupt, racist that has no soul. She is a rapist and pedophile. Her acts are treasonous and by supporting her you condone her actions.
20 | Michael Crouse | 1 | 10155545361701509_10155545447606509 | I guess if Hillary wasn't so crooked and Trump wasn't so loose with his comments and the FBI could make up their minds and Obama and his household could stay in Washington and not waste my taxpayer's money and repeal Obama(not)care this might be an interesting election.

1 | Brandon Horan | 880 | 10155545186216509_10155545197101509 | Can you all stop with Hillary and Trump craps.The world doesn't revolve around the election and your idiotic candidates. 2 souls just gone. Be thankful for their service and have some respect.
2 | Alicia Martin | 341 | 10155545186216509_10155545191806509 | Really trump, Obama and the pipeline have nothing to do with this. They didn't give the suspect the gun Maybe try taking this seriously. Lives were lost.
3 | James Grubbs | 445 | 10155545186216509_10155545192936509 | This is what happens when you make career criminals into hero's and all police officers out to be racist killers. Good job democrats....
4 | Lisa Rhodes Rasmusson | 265 | 10155545186216509_10155545302886509 | Iowa is a family oriented place to live. We take all murders seriously and ALL lives matter to us. Common sense rules in Iowa and the Des Moines metro area. We love our officers and citizens, so keep your political, hateful, vile, sick comments to yourself, the hate you communicate is the problem! Praying for all, especially those officers families! 💔
5 | Amy Baker Myers | 191 | 10155545186216509_10155545215646509 | You all need to grow up! This is not a political issues right now, have a heart. People lost their lives and families are getting the knock at the door that they were always afraid of. I don't care what your political views are. Just be human and show some sympathy.
6 | Heather Alicia | 144 | 10155545186216509_10155545209096509 | Two families do not have their loved ones coming home and yet you all are trying to use this as part of your political agendas. The bodies aren't even cold yet, and the suspect hasn't even been identified. Can you please calm yourselves down for once??NOTE: I meant this on both sides though some are assuming my political stance. Sad.UPDATE: The suspect has been identified. Though, I doubt that changes anyone's political view on both sides. Too many too blind to see the issue.

This madness has to stop from everywhere that it comes.  I have African American friends I fear for. And my son-in-law, the father of my grandson, who is a cop, that I fear for.  My prayers go out to the families of these officers.  We don't yet know the motivation here.  We should just all give thoughts and prayers to the families, that those responsible will be caught and brought to justice, and that instead of pointing fingers and perpetrating more violence and hatred, we can instead look to solutions.

They believe to be above the law.Now,I don't agree with what had happened here just as I don't believe there has been justice served when many of us has been gunned down in cold blood by an officer with racial motivations.When the "good" cops stand up & speak out against the bad cops then maybe people wouldn't seek revenge against them all.& IDC what you guys say this is what happens when injustice becomes the norm and police are held accountable just as the rest of us are.No one should be able to commit murder badge or not!

Paul Parizek told reporters.Police began discovering the killings around 1:05 a.m., when someone reported shots being fired. Responding officers found the body of an Urbandale police officer, still seated in his squad car, at an Urbandale intersection just northwest of Des Moines, Parizek said.Twenty minutes later, as officers were responding to the Urbandale shooting, an officer found a Des Moines police officer shot at an intersection in Des Moines, about 2 miles southeast of the first scene.

She certainly was celebrated for that comment (in the same way Obama was celebrated for his "line in the sand"). Michelle'sa focus in on Africa, not the United States and you have to wonder why? Are US citizens not worthy of her.....special skills? Africa has 13 states that still practice slavery, one of them is the Congo where she focusses on educating young girls. But there are young girls suffering from malnutrition, poor health, poor education, physical and sexual abuse and a host of other problems among Native Americans...do Red Lives Matter?

We only have a dictator as a president whose pride is to gag the opposition and keep them in confinement in the pretence of fighting corruption.

An idiot is an idiot irrespective of location. How can you address Nigeria with such myopic comment? How dare you? Nigeria poses the best brains academically in the USA, a few miscreants here and there does not give you the right to condemn Our beloved Country! Is is not in America that a little white boy decided to kill blacks and did you hear anyone asking if anything good can come out of America? It's a shame! Even in California where you claim you live, am sure no one knows who the hell you are or where your from! Very soon you would start asking why the govt doesn't fight for its citizens abroad it's because of idiots like you saying crap!

It appears that Donald J. Trump borrowed huge amounts of money for his casinos, lost the money, and then claimed that loss so he could avoid paying taxes, writes one analyst.

3 | Riya Sharma | 1306 | 10155545074251509_10155545075821509 | Remember when Trump was laughed at for saying Hillary had the questions ahead of time? Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.

6 | Jay Harvanek | 502 | 10155545074251509_10155545085091509 | Somebody at CNN gave Donna Brazile the debate questions ahead of time. Are you investigating to find the person or persons?
7 | Kody Morrell | 344 | 10155545074251509_10155545088221509 | CNN in desperate scramble to change the narrative from Clinton corruption scandals. No one cares about taxes, there isnt a single solitary person in America who doesnt spend every year trying to pay as little taxes as possible,  otherwise H&R Block wouldnt even exist...and anyone who says otherwise is as big a LIAR as Hillary Clinton is. This media bias crap is dried up and old. How about you report on yourself for rigging the debates by having YOUR people leak Hillary the questions before hand you liberal propagandist joke of a network? #Trump2016

With the horrible laws democrats have set in place for businesses which caused America to lose thousands of jobs...no wonder.

As a conservative I knew they leaned left, but I always wanted to hear both sides, but now it isn't even trying to hide their bias. Might as well watch russian news station, same propaganda machine as CNN.What they should be reporting on is why they waited 2 weeks to admit that Brazile and CNN had parted ways, and what investigation is being done to find out who leaked what, but we won't be hearing any  of that.

It's a 30 hour class you take and then you can volunteer for cases with your local court. There are a lot of bad parents out there, but most of them have gotten hooked on drugs and can't control their lives, or they grew up in the system and were tossed around and don't know how to be a decent parent. We can't judge the parents b/c we don't know their situations, but we can certainly help the children. http://www.casaforchildren.org/site/c.mtJSJ7MPIsE/b.5301295/k.BE9A/Home.htm

2 | Paul Duke Barrette | 27 | 10155544859326509_10155544883391509 | Anyway, hey CNN, have you noticed all those pesky protesters outside your office building begging you to mention the Dakota Pipeline and Standing Rock fiasco to the world? You might want to consider it.
3 | Samir Sele | 1 | 10155544859326509_10155545378326509 | That is a good gesture. However,one church in Eldoret with a pastor mathew keeps insulting muslims as witchdoctors and pagans.

10 | Becky Felice | 4 | 10155544859326509_10155544916806509 | I asked a young Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”. Here is her answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.  Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.  Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.  Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.  Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.  Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.  Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?  Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.  Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life.  Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.  Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.  Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.  And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.

Then it is proven DNC paid protestors to be violent...you give extensive time on women that 30 years ago said he made sexual advances against them..Wikileaks proves Hillary paid some to say these things..no evidence.....now it's Trump has Russian ties...or he did something wrong on his taxes...there is NO criminal investigation and NEVER has been a criminal investigation on Trump. If any of these things are illegal all it takes is a congressman or President to present evidence and a criminal investigation would be started. There is no criminal investigation...You in the media are scumbags. Why hasn't the president that hates Trump have him criminally investigated? There is no evidence. Regarding the hatch act that federal employees cannot influence the election...we have a president that is trying his best to influence the election by campaigning for Hillary uses our tax dollars.

Bad news for those who relied on cranberries to take care of a UTI
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Nancy Westgard | 16 | 10155544805821509_10155544817541509 | No it doesn't. It just kills the pain. The bacteria will continue to flourish, until you go to the doctor and get antibiotics.
2 | Lindsay Watson Franzo | 14 | 10155544805821509_10155544822936509 | This article is so misleading and exudes a lack of knowledge and ignorance! I guess they hire just anybody to "write articles"~#nursesrock!!
3 | Allondria Rogers | 21 | 10155544805821509_10155544814291509 | I'm going to get baptized and give myself to god and God only I will be a woman of God and find a husband that is a man of God and nothing else I will by all means not change me but I want to be a born again I will not have relations until I'm married from this point on!
4 | Anthony Greenlees | 6 | 10155544805821509_10155545232836509 | It was never meant to. It was meant to inhibit further infection from remaining in the kidney and bladder. Consider the cranberry and its acidity to act as a barrier. Most people drink it only after the finding of a uti. I personally do a 64oz flush over two hours once per week. Good for hydration, vitamin c, uti and kidney stone.
5 | Julie Farel | 1 | 10155544805821509_10155545523546509 | I thought the benefit of cranberry juice was it cleanses your bladder, especially overnight. But if you have a real infection you need real meds.  It's good for overall health due to the vitamin C.
6 | Dawn Auburger | 4 | 10155544805821509_10155544950776509 | Cranberry juice gets rid of UTIs.... prevent? I don't know about that... no I didn't read this article,  only commenting from the headline... lol
7 | Emilie Ellery Liabenow | 2 | 10155544805821509_10155546216216509 | I disagree!!!Cranberry juice and cranberry Azo are a dream come true in this situation. Right as you know it's coming on.... Hit both those hard and it goes away.... For me anyway, no dr needed!
8 | Deborah N Vince Crooks | 0 | 10155544805821509_10155545954916509 | Yes don't believe it will cure it, as once you notice blood it's too late you need to seek medical attention as you can turn septic pretty fast. Years ago a doctor gave me a lecture as I went in with an infection and explained I was drinking Cranberry juice to flush it out, she wasn't happy about that.
9 | Lynn Miller | 0 | 10155544805821509_10155545726571509 | Try Ellura it is a cranberry supplement with PACT, made by a European  pharmaceutical company out of Atlanta. I usually have 5 or 6 a year, but I am down to one if any at all. Its a little expensive, but cheaper than a doctors visit and antibiotics.
10 | Diane Cavender McGee | 15 | 10155544805821509_10155544818216509 | It might not prevent but it sure helps once you have one

13 | Wayne Merryman | 2 | 10155544805821509_10155545471766509 | I don't trust the first word from govt. scientists. These are the same clowns that engineer pain meds to be addictive. Then make drugs that like Methadone and Neproxin to ease the withdrawals. I knew an old man back in the 70s who was a retired govt. scientist and he swore there were more than 1 cure for all ranges of cancer from brain, breast, lung, skin cancers etc but the profit from treating these diseases was astronomical. Every drug has a manufactured side effect with potential to have to be treated with ANOTHER drug. The evil that exists within the human race rivals any from any religious text. I'll die believing that.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jerry Kanoff | 41 | 10155544749236509_10155544755761509 | The best city in the world is Tokyo, hands down. Overpopulated? Yes. But awesome in every way possible. I'd select Amsterdam as my second choice.

8 | Phil Hunter | 2 | 10155544689066509_10155545521631509 | The United States is so far behind in this technology that it is doubtful that we will ever be a player in maglev transportation. I remember doing a presentatioon to my Urban Economics class back in 1972. The other students laughed at my description of the technology. They thought it was sciience fiction One student even yelled out soemthing about 'Star Trek fantasy'. Then, I described how the Bullet Trains were actually productive working systems in France and Japan. Their reaction was silence. Nobody likes to be shown up and that was true for students then and my liberal economics professor who thought Urban Economics should be a more socialized endeavor. What is lost on people in the US is the timing and objectives of this system. Even though WWII had long ended there still existed the task of bringing rural/suburban centers together with the urban cities in affected war economies.Then, they had open spaces for laying tracks with less enviornmental impact. That is not true today. Particularly in the congested rural areas where agriculture is so vital. The objective of bringing two major cities like San francisco and Los Angeles is all wrong. It is costly. Unlike the French and Japanese, California is not paying low startup cost or wholesale price for the first US 'Bullet Train'. We are paying high retail. As described the Japanese are building on the original maglev technology of 1964. We still don't have a clue as to this technology let alone its potential appplication. Our technological priorities and planning are so far behind that we will squander millions, decimate our enviornment, and bankrupt sectors and regions of our economy, before we will come to the realization that we are living in a cave compared to the rest of the world when in comes to regional/urban trasnportation and the objective of linking low density communities with highly concentrated urban centers.

The banana is the world's most popular fruit crop, but it's also highly vulnerable. Here's how scientists are trying to prevent an edible variety from going extinct. http://cnn.it/2f7ApCW

1 | Brian Dinsmore | 16 | 10155544610726509_10155544768706509 | I hope bananas do not go extinct. Bananas are one of the best fruits! in all stages of a banana it has some sort of heath benefit from the time it is green to even when it is brown its all edible and has diffrent heath benefits.
2 | Muriungi Ashford | 7 | 10155544610726509_10155544697741509 | they cannot go extinct in Africa we have banana forests which we harvest to give to white monkeys and pigsto eat.
3 | Jerry Thomas Davison | 2 | 10155544610726509_10155546473796509 | better this variety goes extinct than continue to use the massive amount of pesticides it takes to keep them 'healthy' Most banana plantations are coastal, and are contributing heavily to the death of coral reefs. Choose your bananas well.
4 | Anita Vassar | 12 | 10155544610726509_10155544640516509 | 50 years ago we didn't have these GMO's that taste like crap compared to what real food once tasted like. Idiots who think they know better ? Or is it another method of thining the herds ?

Most subjects like that are called patient 1,2,3, or A, B,C, etc...it was told as I was growing that patient zero was into animals, tried to have sex with a monkey, the monkey bit him, giving him HIV...then he spread it, & so on..smhBut some of the older generation that I have worked with, still believe that...like the article says...it's a mystery as to where it actually came from...this would be a case were the family should sue the company that helped smear his name, because of stupidity

15 | Troy Holm | 4 | 10155544374421509_10155544482366509 | Father God,I pray for Your favor to help Donald J. Trump, his family and his team of advisers. Empower them as Your agents to overturn injustice, take dominion away from those that perpetuate evil, and implement justice for the oppressed. Position yourself around them as a shield. I pray You keep the Trump family safe and protect them from evil plots against them. Give their security team wisdom and advance knowledge of any trouble set against them so that it cannot be executed.I ask You to give this team the wisdom that the enemy cannot contradict nor refute according to Luke 21:15. Bless this team and specifically Donald J.Trump and his family with discernment, the Spirit of Understanding, prophetic insight and foresight. Grant them the ability to formulate and implement excellent strategy against all adversaries and enemies. Help them to be unpredictable to those that seek to ruin them and thwart their success. Send out the weapons out of your armory that will create fear and confusion in the enemy camp and eliminate the opposition’s ability to advance against themLord Jesus, show those on the side of opposition that You are not on their side fighting ungodly battles with them and let them know there is no way they can win. Demoralize those that have made the enemy’s agenda their own. Cause them to lose hope in their ungodly leader(s). Release the fear of the Lord into their lives. Let them lose hope in those that are supporting the wrong causes so that they switch their alliances. I also ask You to convince the American people to vote for Donald Trump. Let their voices be heard and their votes counted. I ask that You expose all voter fraud and prevent illegal activity from overturning the voice of the people. Let Your angels be released on assignment to oversee these processes and insure Your will come to pass.I ask you to create calculated disorder to weed out, pluck up and remove ungodly authority and all those determined to fight for an evil agenda. Create enmity where it’s needed in order to divide loyalties and tear apart the alliances that support and defend evil. Help us make this nation great again with Your help. We acknowledge You as our Creator and God of this nation. Thin out adversarial forces and cause them to retreat, give up, and utterly take themselves out of the battle. Feed the enemy's paranoia by convincing them that those they are fighting are superior in every way and have capabilities that they cannot match. Release information that convinces them they have already lost so that they will admit their defeat. Send Your help in answered prayer quickly, O Lord. I bless Donald J. Trump and ask that Your hand of favor and blessing be upon him, enabling him to carry out all Your will and purpose. May it bring you great glory to see every adversary defeated. In Jesus name, amen.

A vote for her is a vote for worldwide economic slavery and evil, endless war! She's a corrupt, evil, lying warmonger who already has blood on her hands of thousands of people and millions of dollars of blood money in the Clinton Foundation. #NeverHillary
17 | Yan Ack | 1 | 10155544374421509_10155544479156509 | Hillary makes a tv ad featuring trump's x rated monologue that plays every hour. Perhaps she imagined living rooms nationwide without children in them, just adults eating their breakfast and watching tv and hearing this stuff. How would a parent feel, who had young children and this ad just blares out without warning ?It says a lot of hillary's sefishness and that's why trump called her a bad example for his young son.
18 | Don Mcclure | 1 | 10155544374421509_10155544505656509 | Do you really think people like Hillary Clinton, George Soros, Islamic Dictators and Wall Street is what this country needs as leaders? Trump, Pence, Carson, Flynn, Icahn, Sessions sounds much better
19 | Jerry Stevens | 0 | 10155544374421509_10155546361281509 | Hillary is so grotesque and despicable. She's a criminal heathen who would burn America to the ground and piss on the ashes if that were the only way to become president. Hillary is a narsassistic sociopath filled with hate and will enslave us all to get what she wants. She considers Americans lower than raw sewage.

A roughly 10% nationwide tax on sugar-sweetened beverages was introduced in Mexico in 2014.

1 | Justin May | 80 | 10155544317751509_10155544327556509 | Its about money..... Stop taxing the food and beverages! Healthy or not, that should not be a reason to tax something. People should be allowed to drink what they want with out paying a tax to do so. Government shouldn't control how you live your 1 life.
2 | Jennifer Carton Meyer | 24 | 10155544317751509_10155544442101509 | Junk food is taxed in Canada. We don't pay taxes on "grocery items", but pay it on confectionery type items. The tax on alcohol and tobacco products  is even greater. Because we have a universal health care system it is the assumption that these extra tax dollars are spent on higher healthcare costs attributed to unhealthy lifestyles.
3 | Tori Leigh Rhoades | 6 | 10155544317751509_10155544351236509 | let's say it together, correlation is not causation. The drop in consumption is likely to be more relating to education and alternative options than the tax itself. Also comparing what is essentially a 3rd world country with ours  where our average income is significantly higher wereas the increase taxation would be considerably less of a deterrent needs to be considered. Not to mention that our fiscally irresponsible government should not be further enabled with more funds to misappropriate enabling them to think up more punishment taxes for them to abuse their authority with.
4 | Ren Barksdale | 5 | 10155544317751509_10155544332806509 | Tax soda please ! I hate soda! I haven't drank a soda in almost 3 months and hopefully I never taste it again ! True story ! I gave my rotwieler some last week just to see if he would drink it but he wouldn't ! Then I put milk and he greedily drank it !
5 | Ben Bergin | 5 | 10155544317751509_10155544429091509 | Products that damage human health should be taxed to pay for the damage they do and to reduce consumption. Cigarettes are a case in point. We all pay higher insurance premiums because of sugary drinks. A soda tax is justified just like the cigarette tax is justified.
6 | Jorge Santiago | 5 | 10155544317751509_10155544391516509 | This is how they get u...a small tax, that seems insignificant...but then, they keep adding to it, next thing u know, they made BILLIONS, of it...so, they'll keep making those "insignificant" tax increases, because in the end, they make more money...and once they do that and get away with it...it will never stop! Sad but true.
7 | Paul M Winters | 2 | 10155544317751509_10155545325341509 | The ONLY moral argument for taxes is to provide the revenue needed to provide civic services, and even that is open to debate on how much is too much. When it starts become a punitive tool by control freaks to guide the behaviors of the citizens it crosses over into social engineering. I hope the good citizens of the cities facing this question on the ballot reject it. Because it will not end with soda.
8 | Gino Hoffmann | 0 | 10155544317751509_10155546253251509 | I have no problem with higher taxes on junk food, cigarettes and alcohol. Neither are necessary to sustain life. Healthy, nutritional, fresh foods are. Could help reduce the obesity problem our country faces as well... (maybe).... I don't see the benefit of allowing junk food to be purchased with food share programs either while I support those programs for those families that have a temporary need. It should be meant as a temporary solution only to receive nourishment until that person or family's circumstances change and they are able to pay for their own food. We're doing a disservice by allowing junk food to be purchased that has no nutritional value. Wasting away taxpayer money...I realize they are two separate issues but it's important to talk about ways to reduce waste and abuse when tax increases are proposed. This should be a non-partisan discussion.
9 | Tim Fennell | 0 | 10155544317751509_10155545465191509 | Probably everyone does something that is unhealthy. It would be impractical (if not impossible) to tax every unhealthy activity and do so on a fair scale. For example, is it really unhealthy to drink on soda every 6 months, as I do? Is drinking one soda every 6 months more of a health risk than many other activities that are not taxed? Sin taxes are just a form of tyrannical control that those in power exercise over others.
10 | Allen Sauner | 1 | 10155544317751509_10155544528826509 | Bans, prohibition and outlawing things hasn't ever worked. How does taxing something work in favor of anything but government making money and now playing a part in victimization?
11 | Jacob Jamerson | 0 | 10155544317751509_10155546240231509 | You should hear the tape recordings of me calling Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama from 2006 in the us senate, that's really what they're looking for ,me talking about the masonic secret society , after the Secret Service kick me off the phone Hillary and Barack ran for president, I should be dead right now.
12 | Rodrigo Flores | 2 | 10155544317751509_10155544447231509 | People should be able to make CHOICES. It's pathetic that the government intends to control every single thing. Everybody should be able to make bad choices and pay for the consequences.
13 | Daniela June Bishop | 0 | 10155544317751509_10155544463341509 | No because people are addicted to them. I never knew how much until we had a water crises here. And the water was shut off for two days. We couldn't sell fountain sodas because of the water lines. We had people irate because they couldn't get there fountain dr pepper and got even more mad when we said we had it in the bottles. They would cry saying it was not the same. I even had one lady said she did not care if she got sick she needed her fountain soda and the bottled soda was not the same.
14 | John Lair | 0 | 10155544317751509_10155546025986509 | Taxes serve only one purpose; to raise money for the government to spend. Cigarette taxes are the perfect example. If the government was sincere about stopping smoking, they would use that money to help people quit. Or better yet, they would ban cigarettes.
15 | Estefania Bayona | 0 | 10155544317751509_10155544635481509 | I'm Mexican, and 2.5 lt Coca-Cola went from MXN$23 to up to MXN$35. No matter high up the price is, Mexicans will ALWAYS but sodas.

17 | Jo Anne | 1 | 10155544317751509_10155544493281509 | Canada taxes junk food, period, and has done for years. Funds medical. Why would a country not tax junk?
18 | Jonathan Lindsey | 0 | 10155544317751509_10155545027706509 | The government could care less about your health. If they did, they would ban unhealthy substances and foods instead of just taxing them. It's all about the $
19 | Candice Harper | 0 | 10155544317751509_10155544712291509 | If people just stopped over-eating there wouldn't be this problem. Blame it on cheese and meat, not freakin' Pepsi.

21 | Deb Carlock | 0 | 10155544317751509_10155544717406509 | People who want sugary drinks will buy them despite a surtax. It's not going to slow most people down. Some, but not a lot.
22 | Clayton Utterback | 0 | 10155544317751509_10155544770766509 | How long have we been taxing alcohol and or cigarettes. I don't see anyone slowing down. But they sure do buy cheaper alcohol and cigarettes. The theory to tax something to make people stop is ridiculous.
23 | Lisa Franklin | 1 | 10155544317751509_10155544375331509 | I hope they tax the dear life out of it and spend it on their sidechicks. When you stop drinking it, you'll begin to feel the difference in your body.
24 | Tj Proffitt | 0 | 10155544317751509_10155545682266509 | I personally would be happy if the United States went in the exact opposite way of Mexico on law issues.  Except of course border security, as Mexico don't play with people breaking into their country.
