Many Republicans were confident. It was their key to victory. But, Trump failed to make a clear case against Clinton (again).

And based on the Project Veritas undercover videos released, it has admittedly be done for years! Why is the media and America not livid at what was revealed in those videos but will immediately crucify Trump for saying that he would wait and see what actually happens before making that commitment. Should we just idly sit by and allow the corruption of the election system in this country to continue? In case you haven't seen those videos for yourself here is the link to their website.  Watch it and make your own decision and stop letting the media make decisions for you and do not comment unless you have watched both videos!

1 | Glenn Hassig | 10154748276564729_10154748293219729 | After the vicious treatment Sanders received from the " establishment" it is a very real thing for us to suspect our election process is rigged! We saw the emails from Wasserman and the vicious treatment Hillary and the media coordinated to beat Sanders to death with. Not to mention the open law suite in California for the uncounted DNC votes. So yes Trump is an ass hole but he is not wrong.
2 | Jan Eastman | 10154748276564729_10154748282639729 | That's right because his greatest move will happen after he wins or loses...watch out Washington!!!

2 | Claude Barreto | 10154747192994729_10154747298319729 | I am starting to think Trump is right. The elections are rigged. Republicans shouldn't even go out and vote on November 28. What's the point? It's rigged!

10 | Gary Hanson | 10154747192994729_10154747424734729 | Trump can not give the Hillary Clinton campaign a blank check to do any illegal or dishonest activity they want.   We know from the emails that Hillary didn't win the Democrat nomination fairly from Bernie Sanders.   We know from the recent project veritas video that the Hillary campaign has hired groups to cause violence at Trump events, these individuals also talked about the election fraud they have done for years and were preparing to do again in this elections (busing voters from one polling location to another, then going on to the next State).   George Soros, a big Hillary Clinton campaign manager and donor, businesses provide and manufacture the electronic polling equipment used exclusively in 16 battleground States.   There has already been some questionable trends in early voting in a number of States.   Has any past Presidential Campaign been required to make such a guarantee?   Look back to the Bush/Gore election of Nov. 7th 2000, the initial results before the recounts and court battles had Bush winning  (Gore actually called Bush to concede on Nov. 8th 2000 at 2:30am, at 3:30am Gore calls Bush back to retract his concession).   Both campaigns used every legal avenue open to them to contest the election, only when it became apparent that Bush won both Ohio and Florida by slim margins did Gore concede (on Dec. 13th) and then only after months of battles.   http://uselectionatlas.org/INFORMATION/ARTICLES/pe2000timeline.php

15 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154747192994729_10154747298654729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.1st DEBATE ~ EPIC FAILURE ON DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS PART!  AND THIS GUY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT???  I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO!  HILLARY CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE, HANDS DOWN!!!#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence
16 | Jeffery Emrick | 10154747192994729_10154747589504729 | Allene Rubio - If we want to take a Shovel and Dig to The Heart of the Issue here? Than let's talk about this in the perspective of Exposing Republican's Exposed Democrat - Light , Truth , and Transparency. Exposing Republicans on a Daily Basis. And where I Am Going with this is the fact that Republican's George W. Bush Jr. and Dick Cheney got distracted from the original assignment. And the original assignment after 9 / 11 was to go After Osama Bin Laden and his masterminds and containment of that was to be limited to Afghanistan. Not Expanded as apart of the distraction to Iraq. We Progressive Liberal Democrat's never ever agreed to be and become on going occupier's of Iraq that has tied this nation and it's people and it's economic tax dollars as an on going blank check from the U.S. Treasury Department that is a Nightmare of a Quagmire that can be compared to the Vietnam War as though our nation and it's people are stuck in quicksand that we are unable to get out of. And the American People are Mad and Pissed Off. And Rightfully and Accordingly so. And that it was The Beat and Bang the Drums of War , War Mongrel , War Profiteering , Republican's who got us mixed up in this unending quagmire of the occupation of Iraq to begin with which was a Distraction from the original assignment of going after Osama Bin Laden , his masterminds , the Taliban and their terrorist training grounds in Afghanistan that were specifically identified their public involvement with 9  / 11. That's what we Democrat's signed on for. Not the Republican's Distraction of Iraq in George Jr. Settling George Sr's old Score with Saddam Hussein in the First Gulf War in his Failure to take out Saddam Hussein then when he had broad International Support to do so when Saddam chose to be an Occupier of Kuwait our Ally. You want to know - "The Truth?" You just heard it. GO Hillary - Stronger Together - 2016 All The Way. :-)
17 | Jeffery Emrick | 10154747192994729_10154747588219729 | Republican Donald J. Trump - Publicly Touting Voter Fraud - is an attempt to Mirror Bernie Sanders - Supporters having done the same. Republican Donald J. Trump's (P.S.) - Political Strategy behind it all? Is to persuade Bernie Sanders supporters to vote for him in order to bring up the percent of his vote tally on election day. When have Republican's ever legitimately gave a fuck about voter fraud? After all did Republican's give a fuck about voter fraud in 2000 when Republican George W. Bush Jr. Stole the U.S. Presidency From Democrat Al Gore in the state of Florida? Had they gave a Fuck about Voter Fraud in 2000 Republican George W. Bush Jr. would have never ever been the President of the United States of America to have gotten America and the American people in an unending quagmire war in Iraq that has essentially financially and economically flushed America and the American people down the toilet. So when you hear Beat and Bang the Drums of War , War Mongrel , and War Profiteering Republican's Tout Voter Fraud? At the end of the Day Republican's Nobody wants your unending wars that gets America and the American People and their U.S. Tax Dollars being treated like a blank check from the U.S. Treasury Department in behalf of your unending wars and Quagmire's that you intentionally and on purpose start being the Beat and Bang the Drums of War , War Mongrel , War Profiteering Republicans that you are. Quite Frankly We Progressive Liberal Democrat's are Dam Well Tired of Our U.S. Taxpayer Dollars not being spent on our country and our countries people in the Domestic Issues and the Domestic Affairs of We The People of the United States of America on Main Street. Hard Working Blue Collared American Men and Women on Main Street. It is time we bring our U.S. Taxpayer Dollars Home in the investing in America and the American People. Long Story Short Republican's - Fuck Your Wars and Rumors of Wars. Voter Fraud Republicans? Normally you are the ones engaging in it. I.E. - Example - The Voter Fraud of Republican's in the state of Florida that cheated Al Gore out of the U.S. Presidency in 2000 while illegally bringing to power Republican George W. Bush Jr. to the U.S. Presidency that which should have never ever occurred in the Predominantly Republican Controlled U.S. Supreme Court's illegal intervention into the Great Sovereign State of Florida's Election Laws. Where as every state of the union has the Sovereign Right to Dictate or Mandate its own States Election Laws with in the realm of Local Authority. For the Predominantly Republican Controlled U.S. Supreme Court to have done what it did in 2000 it done so acting outside the scope of it's Authority. So let's talk about Voter Fraud Republican's. Because I Am Dam well Ready to Talk about it.

During the third presidential debate, Donald Trump made an absolutely extraordinary claim, in every sense of the word.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mike Marriott | 10154747191739729_10154747233344729 | Donald Trump is now a bigger threat to US democracy than ISIS will ever be.This is truly terrifying - no really it is. It could start a blood bath or mini civil war. Get him under control GOP!Since the Civil War the US has been a stable democracy. Trump is threatening to undo centuries of democratic culture and norms.He just destroyed himself - but in doing so has sown dragons teeth.Don't be surprised should monsters spring forth.
2 | Sam Arnold | 10154747191739729_10154747303684729 | This clown said it was okay for Japan and Saudi Arabia to get nukes then lied saying he didn't. Anyone paying only half attention has seen this video of him doing exactly that.
3 | Rachelle Cano | 10154747191739729_10154747454439729 | I just heard a commentator on CNN say that if Hillary wanted to set the Wikileaks emails record straight she could show her real emails against the hacked ones...That's RIDICULOUS to VALIDATE Russian espionage and give the Kremlin the power to disrupt and lose confidence in our democratic process‚Äîexactly what the Russians and Assange are trying to do! Stir up our democracy and cause chaos so they can sit back and laugh at us all! You think Assange wants a Clinton presidency? Of course not! He has a much better chance of getting out of the Ecuadorean Embassy with a Trump presidency. In fact, he has someone who will empathize with the allegations of rape waiting for Assange in the Swedish court. And, with Clinton he would face long-awaited espionage charges likely to imprison him for life.
4 | Sally van Dam | 10154747191739729_10154747263294729 | Was unfortunate to have been awake half the night & listened to this maniac.... he just gets worse. The US needs to seriously question his mental condition!!!!
5 | Glenn Hassig | 10154747191739729_10154748306284729 | After seeing the way the "establishment" treated Sanders how can there be any question the election process has been compromised??? Trump is an ass hole but he is not wrong to say our election process  has been compromised. The media is out of control and is now running the election process for profit. Vicious animals like Clinton operating in dark room "airplane hangers" a DNC openly saying they have every right to subvert the primary process. Most importantly a voter base so manipulated that they think it is ok Bill Clinton met with Loretta Lynch or Wasserman undermining the primary process. Or the media deciding who gets air time and who does not resulting in almost total control of the election process. The medias bias is very clear for all voters to see yet the establishment does nothing because it helps there agenda.
6 | Gerald Barnhill | 10154747191739729_10154747215244729 | First he want lose and their is voter fraud as the trash comes='s out your mouth so I wouldn't bow down to that trash either NOV.8TH all this shit your talking don't mean shit.DON'T BOO VOTE    NEVER LYING HILLARY I like the one she had onthe borders when chris ask her she voted on open borders and she said that was to share ELECTRIC ALL AMERICA WAS LAUGHING ALL THE WAY FROM CHINA.

8 | Ava Garcia | 10154747191739729_10154747413504729 | Astonishing!  Wow!  Did you say Gore was astonishing for challenging the election results when he lost to Bush?  Of course you didn't.
9 | Keith John Sampson | 10154747191739729_10154747198674729 | When Trump loses he can whine all day and night but he will still be a loser. And Hillary Clinton will be President.

11 | Peter J. Furbert | 10154747191739729_10154747198299729 | That was his way of conceding. He threw in the towel by saying he would not accept the results. The writing is on the wall

Donald Chump Trump is simply a dangerous loose cannon that has no impulse control, is a raving lunatic and narcissist who subscribes to fringe conspiracy theories & is truly a demagogue of the sort that we haven't seen in our lifetimes. Whether you like her or not, Hillary has the experience, knowledge and temperament to lead our country forward. The choice is stark and clear for all rational Americans whether we are Republicans, Democrats or Independents. Despite the evidence, Trump still denies Putin was behind the hacks. He wants to make "Russia Great Again". #NEVERTRUMP. #putcountryfirst

23 | Don Lowery | 10154747191739729_10154747230859729 | Hold on folks. Trump has been talking about the 18 million people that are voting in this election that are either illegal or dead people. These figures are from the Pugh Report not his figures. AND if you know your history in 2000 Al Gore challenged the election due to hanging chads.

1 | Rachelle Cano | 10154747187519729_10154747458414729 | Trump words, from sexual allegations stacked against him, to shady foundation dealings is like "The pot calling the kettle black." He has a distinct habit of calling the kettle black:Tonight he asked Hillary Clinton to give back money to Saudi Arabia and Qatar that was donated to the Clinton Foundation, while he‚Äôs been cleaning up in the Middle East for years selling his clothing lines, lifestyle products, and golf clubs. He uses those nation's poor record on human rights and women‚Äôs rights to prompt her to return foundation donations that used in the prevention of Aids in high-risk nations, and that provide help to millions suffering who would not otherwise receive standard care, while he has enjoyed years of business profits in those same states.http://qz.com/568178/donald-trump-owes-much-of-his-fortune-to-wea/http://www.wsj.com/articles/dubai-retailer-stops-selling-trump-branded-products-1449691328
2 | Iqbal Rahman Rokon | 10154747187519729_10154747187764729 | Only reason Trump is here as GOP nominee (rumor is with the help of president Bill Clinton's advice and guidance) is to assure Hillary's win - more election is nearing, more it is becoming obvious.

4 | Rhoderick Gates | 10154747187519729_10154748296509729 | Gore never complained about a 'rigged' election for a month or so before election day. Nor rule out accepting the result. In fact, Gore did not say three weeks before the election of 2000 that he was not prepared to accept the result. No American major party candidate in the history of our democracy has ever said anything so dangerous and disruptive, or made so deliberate and strategic an effort to persuade the Party base that democracy itself could not be trusted.In 2000, when the result of the actual election itself was so close that an automatic recount was triggered, Gore tried to push back against what he perceived to be Republican chicanery by a Republican secretary of state in a Republican state governed by the brother of his opponent, and demanded a hand recount of several key counties. That was all after the election itself, and in the end, rather than subject the democracy to continued uncertainty, Gore conceded even though he had won the popular vote, rather than challenge the decision by Republicans on the United States Supreme Court to shut down the recount.In short, Gore put country ahead of both party and self.By contrast Trump, with the support of his running mate, the Republican Party leadership and right-wing propagandists like Lowry and the talk radio crowd, is preemptively attacking and strategically undermining the very legitimacy of our democracy. He has been doing so for weeks, with, again, the complicity of his entire party. This is appalling and unprecedented.By the way, he also claimed from that stage tonight that his opponent should not only have been "jailed," although she has committed no crime and been convicted of nothing; but that she should not have been "permitted" to run against him. Those were just some of the things that Republican standard-bearer Donald Trump said tonight, to the cheers of Republican voters, with no pushback from Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus, or Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
5 | Rachelle Cano | 10154747187519729_10154748449339729 | Yes, for a while he (Trump) had all of us going, thinking he could make it through the debate and actually improve his polling status and sound presidential. But, his inability to control his temper, random comments, and name calling is something even his aides cannot improve upon no matter how much prep they give him. He just can't hide his true colors, and Secretary Clinton knows how to push all his buttons. His response about perhaps not accepting the results is just more of the same to create doubt about the electoral process. He wants to keep all his options open. He is a businessman. He is also enjoying the sense of power and is manipulating his followers to follow his cue should he lose. He has been working up to this for some time now. His comments are not surprising to me. He has been saying similar things for months. http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-warns-supporters-may-riot-fears-violence-escalate-n540516

No we are not perfect but all Rose gardens got thorns and The USA is Great already . The garden has to continue to get gardeners who wants all the people to have a fulfilling life who wants it. Don't you love your country and your democracy we are victors.
5 | Rita Diane Palmer | 10154746704859729_10154746740199729 | Trump has less than a 15 percent chance of winning the presidency according to HuffPost‚Äôs election forecast model. And that‚Äôs all based on polls from before this latest scandal. In order to have a chance at winning the presidency, Trump has to carry several states that are leaning toward his opponent, including Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The worst news for Trump comes out of Ohio. The Buckeye State had been tilting toward the Republican throughout September, but his lead has evaporated in the last two weeks. A new CBS/YouGov poll shows Clinton leading by 4 points, 46 percent to Trump‚Äôs 42 percent. The HuffPost forecast model was calling Ohio for Trump, but that shifted over the weekend. We‚Äôre now calling it for Clinton ‚Äï only with 57 percent certainty, but the trend line is bad for Trump.

9 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154746704859729_10154747159244729 | The Sad True Story of Hillary ClintonThis is the sad but true story of Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton and her husband got very used to their luxurious life style while Bill was the President.However, after his presidency had ended, Bill Clinton having being disbarred for perjury, the Clintons could not continue in their luxurious habits. They could not practice law any longer, so Bill and Hillary Clinton decided to use their political connections to make real big money. They started lobbying the interests of the big banks and corporations!That is why Bill Clinton became the proponent of the notorious financial deregulation movement that eventually destroyed US economy. Bill and Hillary Clinton helped the largest banks have US financial industry essentially deregulated, which resulted in the 2008 financial crisis. The bankers were happy and the Clintons could enjoy the privileges of the upper class. From then on, Hillary Clinton dedicated her life to representing the interests of the big banks and corporations in exchange for money that initially was given to her and Bill in the form of payments for their speeches (hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech). When bigger money became involved, they created their family Clinton Foundation and the money started pouring into it in the form of donations. Her criminal interactions had to be covered up, though. So, HRC was using her private email servers for that purpose while she was serving as secretary of state. That is why later, after the beginning of the Congressional investigation of their activities, the Clintons deleted all those emails, many of which contained government classified information, as they were directly incriminating Hillary Clinton in many shady dealings including selling access to the US Government to their rich foreign donors through the Clinton Foundation. Now, her corrupt friends from among the bankers and certain corporations are trying to use the mainstream news media to make her president, as Hillary Clinton has promised to continue to further consolidate the economic interests of certain private corporations with the political interests of the US Government. The corporate interest groups and the media are trying to make her look good and sound experienced. But in reality Hillary Clinton is not good and she has never been good at anything. Hillary Clinton is very corrupt. She has been corrupt all along. That was the only way she and her disbarred husband could have made such big money to support their lavish life style that they so got used to. However, Hillary and Bill Clinton have gone too far.She sold government contracts and political influence to the highest bidder, which of course were the biggest banks and largest corporations that ravaged the country and caused the financial and economic crisis in the US and the world over! Her corruption threatens to destroy US economy and the very existence of the union. Incompetent as a state official and immensely corrupt as a career politician, HRC is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, too corrupt, and too selfish and irresponsible to occupy the most demanding position in the world. HRC is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. If Hillary Clinton was to be elected president of the United States, the American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin!

First of all ‚Äì the vast majority of people in America are sane, clever and smart people. Secondly, Melania Trump just openly admitted, that Trump was ‚Äúegged on‚Äù by Billy Bush to ‚Äúsay dirty and bad stuff.‚Äù Who on Earth would vote for a man, who is so easily provoked?  Not a sane normal functioning American citizen! Imagine such a miswired, incoherent babblehead as Trump being Chief in Command and President of the greatest nation on Earth?  Trump is also the candidate, who started using name calling, lies and disrespectful language in the presidential debate ‚Äì and that immediately told me ‚Äì that this guy is totally unfit to rule and he should be stopped!Thrump's actions has resulted in the current deplorable and unworthy presidential campaign. Trump will make America a much more unsafe and much poorer place to live with no community cohesion, whatsoever!Remember on voting day, November 8th, 2016 to vote for Hillary. Let me tell you this, Trump -  The end is near and now you face the final curtain - of that you can be very certain!

From then on, Hillary Clinton dedicated her life to representing the interests of the big banks and corporations in exchange for money that initially was given to her and Bill in the form of payments for their speeches (hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech). When bigger money became involved, they created their family Clinton Foundation and the money started pouring into it in the form of donations. Her criminal interactions had to be covered up, though. So, HRC was using her private email servers for that purpose while she was serving as secretary of state. That is why later, after the beginning of the Congressional investigation of their activities, the Clintons deleted all those emails, many of which contained government classified information, as they were directly incriminating Hillary Clinton in many shady dealings including selling access to the US Government to their rich foreign donors through the Clinton Foundation. Now, her corrupt friends from among the bankers and certain corporations are trying to use the mainstream news media to make her president, as Hillary Clinton has promised to continue to further consolidate the economic interests of certain private corporations with the political interests of the US Government. The corporate interest groups and the media are trying to make her look good and sound experienced. But in reality Hillary Clinton is not good and she has never been good at anything. Hillary Clinton is very corrupt. She has been corrupt all along. That was the only way she and her disbarred husband could have made such big money to support their lavish life style that they so got used to. However, Hillary and Bill Clinton have gone too far.She sold government contracts and political influence to the highest bidder, which of course were the biggest banks and largest corporations that ravaged the country and caused the financial and economic crisis in the US and the world over! Her corruption threatens to destroy US economy and the very existence of the union. Incompetent as a state official and immensely corrupt as a career politician, HRC is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, too corrupt, and too selfish and irresponsible to occupy the most demanding position in the world. HRC is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. If Hillary Clinton was to be elected president of the United States, the American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin!
22 | Scott Wayne | 10154746584184729_10154747091559729 | Hillary is looking to go to war with Russia killing American youth. Trump wants to work with Russia to defeat ISIS and save American youth. Hillary People of hati HATE u for stealing their aid money. Hillary where is the $8 Billion you lost at the State Department Hillary ! u had 30 years to fix America, but u chosed to SCREW America! U LOOSE AMERICA WINS for TRUMP!
23 | Cheryl Heymans | 10154746584184729_10154746631519729 | Trump speaks of ending political corruption but what is his view on Citizen's United?  Does he agree that until we get money out of politics, our politicians and parties will remain corrupt?
24 | Liberty Brown | 10154746584184729_10154746609254729 | Russian Cyber Attack?  how about liar? corrupt government?  I get it, they dont want all that garbage revealed, like Obama lying about NOT knowing about Clintons private servers...it was lie and its in the e-mails he DID know.  Or how about the FBI being pressured by the President so they would not take any legal action against Hillary? or how about the DNC plotting against Berny Sanders (and him having no backbone bending over and taking it even AFTER he found out about it) Hillary Clinton endagering National Security?  How about the Clinton campaign setting up protests to start violence at Trump Rallies?  Or how about the actually PROVEN sexual predator Bill Clinton getting meeting together with Loretta Lynch, corrupt Judge, before the FBI made a decision about the wrong use of private servers the Hillary used? How about the democrats caught ON camera talking about how to cheat in the elections?  Interesting how the media is more interested and upset about WHO hacked the e-mails more so than the e-mails THEMSELVES!? Thats like saying I hacked into my friends computer, found a bunch of pictures of children being sexually abused by him and calling the cops...but of course the cops will put ME in handcuffs for hacking his computer, not HIM for SEXUALLY ABUSING KIDS?  It is shameful and embarrassing how uneducated the American population is that they fall for this kind of corruption and one sided media

I don't like some of his characteristics, but I cannot abide open boarders, a woman who openly lies and supports the Muslim Brotherhood, a stacked supreme court that will definitely cancel out the 2nd amendment, and expanded government control over all aspects of our lives!
2 | Samantha Hartwell | 10154746479529729_10154746489504729 | Hillary needs to invite Alec Baldwin dressed as Trump from his SNL skit to sit front and center at the Debate... That would be a HOOT‚ùóÔ∏è
3 | Kathryn Rubenstein | 10154746479529729_10154746485934729 | Haha Trump doesn't have any issues. He's the master of deflecting just like all of his supporters. Ever tried to have a conversation with a Trump supporter?! They have no idea why they support him other than he's rich.

7 | Paul John Gavagan | 10154746479529729_10154746562919729 | HILLARY:‚ÄúMy accomplishments as Secretary of State? Well, I‚Äôm glad you asked! My proudest accomplishment in which I take the most pride, mostly because of the opposition it faced early on, you know, the remnants of prior situations and mind-sets that were too narrowly focused in a manner whereby they may have overlooked the bigger picture, and we didn‚Äôt do that, and I‚Äôm proud of that. Very proud. I would say that‚Äôs a major accomplishment.‚Äù Hillary Clinton 11 March 2014 Could someone please tell me what she just said? And she is running for President!???
8 | Soyla Cristiana | 10154746479529729_10154746579074729 | ATTN: Jorge Ramos And when I was in the 8th grade, I ran in my tube socks. I'd forgotten my sneakers that day. I was the only girl to run in that whole relay and I was the final runner to receive baton. I ran until my feet bled (literally) -- and we won. Now I'm running against Mrs. Clinton to defend the very people from my community who support her, who are trusting someone who is, in my opinion, exploiting (not leading). I know real leaders, moral, brave leaders. I grew up with one. And I will run until my soles bleed. I will not be silenced. #LatinosWithTrump

This is beyond anything else we could be discussing about past (temporal) campaigns, sir. Associated Press has reported the potential use of chemical weapons by ISIS overseas in battle. PLEASE. What is TRUE LEADERSHIP if not putting our nation and true priorities before politics. Mrs. Hillary Clinton has helped bring us here. WE CANNOT PERMIT HER TO BE ELECTED BECAUSE THE RISK IS GREATER WITH HER. HER JUDGMENT IS ENDANGERING ME AND MY FAMILY. PLEASE, MR. BUSH. PLEASE HELP US. PLEASE HELP YOUR COUNTRY.

2 | Iqbal Rahman Rokon | 10154746421579729_10154746493854729 | Only reason Trump is here as GOP nominee (rumor is with the help of President Bill Clinton's advice and guidance) is to assure Hillary's win. :)
3 | Roger Gaddy | 10154746421579729_10154746425424729 | She's such a dirty-butt liar, there are thousands of possibilities.
4 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154746421579729_10154746431569729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.1st DEBATE ~ EPIC FAILURE ON DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS PART!  AND THIS GUY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT???  I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO!  HILLARY CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE, HANDS DOWN!!!#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence
5 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154746421579729_10154746431119729 | SO THE NARCISSISTIC PATHOLOGICAL SERIAL LIAR, THE GUY WHO ASSAULTS, RAPES AND DEMEANS WOMEN ASKS:  "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE"???As a Black, Muslim, Gay AND A Woman. EVERYTHING!!Here is why:1. The misogynistic pathetic small man has shown over and over again throughout his life he has zero respect for women. He has said cringe worthy horrible/outrageous things about women all his life. He has consistently insulted, belittled, sexualized, and stereotyped women. Such insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land. And he has promised to nominate conservative justices who will limit women's reproductive rights & women's ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Just a little history here: "In the 1950s, estimates of numbers of illegal, unsafe abortions ranged widely, from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. The methods used were often ineffective and dangerous. Desperate women were driven into the back alley, where they endured danger and abuse, sometimes sexual." Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there‚Äôs no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. As a woman I can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. So as a woman I have everything to lose. 2.  I was raised in a Muslim family, even though I no longer consider myself a practicing Muslim. So that xenophobic con man's hate-filled rhetoric is a direct attack on my family and I. So as a Muslim American, I can NOT have afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as him. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believe people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. So as a Muslim American I have everything to lose. 3. As a black person I can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. A racist person whose campaign rallies looks like a klan gathering. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights. So as a black American I have everything to lose. 4. As a lesbian I can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT think I should marry whoever my heart desire. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years, I cannot afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back years. So as a gay citizen, I have everything to lose. 5. As a proud citizen of this great country who believes in American values I can NOT afford to have a self-serving, greedy, pathological liar, con-man who is walking all over those values as a president. To the white people who are not motivated by hate and resentment but still support Trump, I as a minority would like to ask you to think about how Trump's presidency affect me and people like me. I would like to sincerely ask you to reconsider your support for him. Please. To the people who are planning to vote for a third party candidate: I would like to ask you to think really, really hard. Especially, if you care about progressive ideas and believe Trump presidency will take us back decades on the progress we have made on women issues, LGBT issues...etc. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. So if you believe the con-man is unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and dangerous please reconsider voting for Hillary Clinton and vote blue up and down the ballot.Trump and Pence show extreme contempt towards Gays, LGBT and LGBTQ.  Both on are record as being ANTI-GAY!A vote for Trump is a lost vote - he will not become the next president of The United States of America!It is paramount that The President of The United States of America is a sane, intelligent, curious, controlled person, who is a reliable, detail-oriented, steadfast, cautious and methodical person without whom organizations and society would dissolve (fall apart). Hillary fits the aforementioned description! She is a woman, who can keep her cool!Trump on the other hand is non-reflecting and ruthless character, who lacks emphatic traits under non-sexual circumstances. He is extremely nervous and very emotional driven. He completely lacks self-knowledge! He is little bothered by second thoughts and self-doubt. That doesn't mean he is smart but that he is rather dumb. His knowledge is in general extremely limited. Since he does not reflect on his errors or analyze any mistakes to any great extent - Trump is incapable to learn from his errors, and so he will be caught in a loop, repeating his mistakes, which can have catastrophic consequences for the US, the rest of the world and possible beyond depending on the nature of his actions.In all fairness in the Vice Presidential debate Tuesday night, October 4, 2016, Mike Pence acted far more "vice presidential" than Tim Kaine, who was rude and insulting as well as he was talking over Mike Pence, who just had to sit there and take it.HOWEVER, Trump would still do the right thing if he voluntarily steps down from the presidential election campaign. Whether he steps down or not he will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America!DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO FIRE NANCY O‚ÄôDELL AFTER SHE REJECTED HIS ADVANCES!  HOW COME HE HASN‚ÄôT APOLOGIZED TO HER?  HIS APOLOGY MEANS NOTHING !!!PROMINATE GOP LEADERS ARE DITCHING DONALD TRUMP IS DROVES.  THE RNC STOPS WORK ON THE ‚ÄúVICTORY‚Äù PROJECT AND PULLS FUNDING FOR DONALD TRUMP !!!DONALD TRUMP RAPED HIS 1ST WIFE, IVANA.  THAT IS DOCUMENTED IN HER BOOK THE (LOST TYCOON).DONALD TRUMP RAPED A 13-YEAR-OLD CHILD AND THE FEDERAL CASE IS PENDING IN NEW YORK.  HE HELD HER AGAINST HER WILL AND RAPED HER REPEATEDLY‚Ä¶‚Ä¶THERE IS A WITNESS‚Ä¶..TRUMP THINKS THAT BECAUSE HE IS A ‚ÄúSTAR‚Äù THAT HE CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING‚Ä¶.HE IS A ‚ÄúSEXUAL PREDATOR‚Äù, WHO NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.  TELL YOUR MOTHERS, YOUR SISTERS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS, NOT TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP!!!TRUMP IS ON RECORD, IN SUPPORT OF BILL CLINTON DURING THE WHITE HOUSE SCANDAL‚Ä¶BILL CLINTON NEVER RAPED ANYONE!LEST NOT FORGET, HILLARY AND CHELSEA WERE THE VICTIMS OF BILL‚ÄôS INDESCRETIONS‚Ä¶BILL CLINTON IS NOT ON THE BALLOT !!! TRUMP THE SERIAL ABUSER/GROPER, SEXUAL PREDATOR, PEDOPHILE AND RAPIST IS !!! #NeverTrumpPence#NoTaxesNoVote#TrumpTheRapistAndPedophile

That is why later, after the beginning of the Congressional investigation of their activities, the Clintons deleted all those emails, many of which contained government classified information, as they were directly incriminating Hillary Clinton in many shady dealings including selling access to the US Government to their rich foreign donors through the Clinton Foundation. Now, her corrupt friends from among the bankers and certain corporations are trying to use the mainstream news media to make her president, as Hillary Clinton has promised to continue to further consolidate the economic interests of certain private corporations with the political interests of the US Government. The corporate interest groups and the media are trying to make her look good and sound experienced. But in reality Hillary Clinton is not good and she has never been good at anything. Hillary Clinton is very corrupt. She has been corrupt all along. That was the only way she and her disbarred husband could have made such big money to support their lavish life style that they so got used to. However, Hillary and Bill Clinton have gone too far.She sold government contracts and political influence to the highest bidder, which of course were the biggest banks and largest corporations that ravaged the country and caused the financial and economic crisis in the US and the world over! Her corruption threatens to destroy US economy and the very existence of the union. Incompetent as a state official and immensely corrupt as a career politician, HRC is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, too corrupt, and too selfish and irresponsible to occupy the most demanding position in the world. HRC is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. If Hillary Clinton was to be elected president of the United States, the American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin!

10 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154746421579729_10154746431364729 | CROOKED DONALD TRUMP AND THE TRUMP CRIME FAMILY Spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire‚Äôs for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents.Those cases, which together used $258,000 from Trump‚Äôs charity, were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against ‚Äúself-dealing‚Äù ‚Äî which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses.In one case, from 2007, Trump‚Äôs Mar-a-Lago Club faced $120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach, Fla., resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole.In a settlement, Palm Beach agreed to waive those fines ‚Äî if Trump‚Äôs club made a $100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans. Instead, Trump sent a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity funded almost entirely by other people‚Äôs money, according to tax records.In another case, court papers say one of Trump‚Äôs golf courses in New York agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiff‚Äôs chosen charity. A $158,000 donation was made by the Trump Foundation, according to tax records.According to the report, Trump used Trump Foundation money, that would be money that was donated by other people to his charitable foundation to do charitable stuff, to pay for debts owed by Trump's personal businesses. This, however, is in keeping with Trump using Trump Foundation money for a political donation to Florida's Attorney General and to buy a portrait of him for his personal use. These all are covered by the IRS regulations prohibiting "self-dealing" by charitable organizations.New Information:  Trump asks those who owe him money to send it to his Trump Charity to avoid paying taxes on it.UPDATE: TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE THE PROPER CERTIFICATION TO SOLICIT OUTSIDE DONORS!  ANYTHING OVER $25,000 REQUIRES AN AUDIT ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK AG.  UH OH‚Ä¶..TRUMP PAID $8.2 Million to Family Members/Businesses.  MONEY CAME FROM THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO HIS CAMPAIGN.

4 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154745817569729_10154746433359729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.1st DEBATE ~ EPIC FAILURE ON DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS PART!  AND THIS GUY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT???  I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO!  HILLARY CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE, HANDS DOWN!!!#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence
5 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154745817569729_10154746432604729 | SO THE NARCISSISTIC PATHOLOGICAL SERIAL LIAR, THE GUY WHO ASSAULTS, RAPES AND DEMEANS WOMEN ASKS:  "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE"???As a Black, Muslim, Gay AND A Woman. EVERYTHING!!Here is why:1. The misogynistic pathetic small man has shown over and over again throughout his life he has zero respect for women. He has said cringe worthy horrible/outrageous things about women all his life. He has consistently insulted, belittled, sexualized, and stereotyped women. Such insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land. And he has promised to nominate conservative justices who will limit women's reproductive rights & women's ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Just a little history here: "In the 1950s, estimates of numbers of illegal, unsafe abortions ranged widely, from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. The methods used were often ineffective and dangerous. Desperate women were driven into the back alley, where they endured danger and abuse, sometimes sexual." Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there‚Äôs no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. As a woman I can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. So as a woman I have everything to lose. 2.  I was raised in a Muslim family, even though I no longer consider myself a practicing Muslim. So that xenophobic con man's hate-filled rhetoric is a direct attack on my family and I. So as a Muslim American, I can NOT have afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as him. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believe people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. So as a Muslim American I have everything to lose. 3. As a black person I can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. A racist person whose campaign rallies looks like a klan gathering. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights. So as a black American I have everything to lose. 4. As a lesbian I can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT think I should marry whoever my heart desire. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years, I cannot afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back years. So as a gay citizen, I have everything to lose. 5. As a proud citizen of this great country who believes in American values I can NOT afford to have a self-serving, greedy, pathological liar, con-man who is walking all over those values as a president. To the white people who are not motivated by hate and resentment but still support Trump, I as a minority would like to ask you to think about how Trump's presidency affect me and people like me. I would like to sincerely ask you to reconsider your support for him. Please. To the people who are planning to vote for a third party candidate: I would like to ask you to think really, really hard. Especially, if you care about progressive ideas and believe Trump presidency will take us back decades on the progress we have made on women issues, LGBT issues...etc. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. So if you believe the con-man is unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and dangerous please reconsider voting for Hillary Clinton and vote blue up and down the ballot.Trump and Pence show extreme contempt towards Gays, LGBT and LGBTQ.  Both on are record as being ANTI-GAY!A vote for Trump is a lost vote - he will not become the next president of The United States of America!It is paramount that The President of The United States of America is a sane, intelligent, curious, controlled person, who is a reliable, detail-oriented, steadfast, cautious and methodical person without whom organizations and society would dissolve (fall apart). Hillary fits the aforementioned description! She is a woman, who can keep her cool!Trump on the other hand is non-reflecting and ruthless character, who lacks emphatic traits under non-sexual circumstances. He is extremely nervous and very emotional driven. He completely lacks self-knowledge! He is little bothered by second thoughts and self-doubt. That doesn't mean he is smart but that he is rather dumb. His knowledge is in general extremely limited. Since he does not reflect on his errors or analyze any mistakes to any great extent - Trump is incapable to learn from his errors, and so he will be caught in a loop, repeating his mistakes, which can have catastrophic consequences for the US, the rest of the world and possible beyond depending on the nature of his actions.In all fairness in the Vice Presidential debate Tuesday night, October 4, 2016, Mike Pence acted far more "vice presidential" than Tim Kaine, who was rude and insulting as well as he was talking over Mike Pence, who just had to sit there and take it.HOWEVER, Trump would still do the right thing if he voluntarily steps down from the presidential election campaign. Whether he steps down or not he will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America!DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO FIRE NANCY O‚ÄôDELL AFTER SHE REJECTED HIS ADVANCES!  HOW COME HE HASN‚ÄôT APOLOGIZED TO HER?  HIS APOLOGY MEANS NOTHING !!!PROMINATE GOP LEADERS ARE DITCHING DONALD TRUMP IS DROVES.  THE RNC STOPS WORK ON THE ‚ÄúVICTORY‚Äù PROJECT AND PULLS FUNDING FOR DONALD TRUMP !!!DONALD TRUMP RAPED HIS 1ST WIFE, IVANA.  THAT IS DOCUMENTED IN HER BOOK THE (LOST TYCOON).DONALD TRUMP RAPED A 13-YEAR-OLD CHILD AND THE FEDERAL CASE IS PENDING IN NEW YORK.  HE HELD HER AGAINST HER WILL AND RAPED HER REPEATEDLY‚Ä¶‚Ä¶THERE IS A WITNESS‚Ä¶..TRUMP THINKS THAT BECAUSE HE IS A ‚ÄúSTAR‚Äù THAT HE CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING‚Ä¶.HE IS A ‚ÄúSEXUAL PREDATOR‚Äù, WHO NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.  TELL YOUR MOTHERS, YOUR SISTERS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS, NOT TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP!!!TRUMP IS ON RECORD, IN SUPPORT OF BILL CLINTON DURING THE WHITE HOUSE SCANDAL‚Ä¶BILL CLINTON NEVER RAPED ANYONE!LEST NOT FORGET, HILLARY AND CHELSEA WERE THE VICTIMS OF BILL‚ÄôS INDESCRETIONS‚Ä¶BILL CLINTON IS NOT ON THE BALLOT !!! TRUMP THE SERIAL ABUSER/GROPER, SEXUAL PREDATOR, PEDOPHILE AND RAPIST IS !!! #NeverTrumpPence#NoTaxesNoVote#TrumpTheRapistAndPedophile
6 | Rode Tmcil | 10154745817569729_10154746510164729 | Hillary, keep up the good work. Donald duck is not a man of honor. He's a desperate clown and a crazy fool and a danger to America.
7 | Henrik Ahlm | 10154745817569729_10154745825969729 | As I have said for weeks  - there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Trump will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America! First of all ‚Äì the vast majority of people in America are sane, clever and smart people. Secondly, Melania Trump just openly admitted, that Trump was ‚Äúegged on‚Äù by Billy Bush to ‚Äúsay dirty and bad stuff.‚Äù Who on Earth would vote for a man, who is so easily provoked?  Not a sane normal functioning American citizen! Imagine such a miswired, incoherent babblehead as Trump being Chief in Command and President of the greatest nation on Earth?  Trump is also the candidate, who started using name calling, lies and disrespectful language in the presidential debate ‚Äì and that immediately told me ‚Äì that this guy is totally unfit to rule and he should be stopped!Thrump's actions has resulted in the current deplorable and unworthy presidential campaign. Trump will make America a much more unsafe and much poorer place to live with no community cohesion, whatsoever!Remember on voting day, November 8th, 2016 to vote for Hillary. Let me tell you this, Trump -  The end is near and now you face the final curtain - of that you can be very certain!

11 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154745817569729_10154747159749729 | The Sad True Story of Hillary ClintonThis is the sad but true story of Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton and her husband got very used to their luxurious life style while Bill was the President.However, after his presidency had ended, Bill Clinton having being disbarred for perjury, the Clintons could not continue in their luxurious habits. They could not practice law any longer, so Bill and Hillary Clinton decided to use their political connections to make real big money. They started lobbying the interests of the big banks and corporations!That is why Bill Clinton became the proponent of the notorious financial deregulation movement that eventually destroyed US economy. Bill and Hillary Clinton helped the largest banks have US financial industry essentially deregulated, which resulted in the 2008 financial crisis. The bankers were happy and the Clintons could enjoy the privileges of the upper class. From then on, Hillary Clinton dedicated her life to representing the interests of the big banks and corporations in exchange for money that initially was given to her and Bill in the form of payments for their speeches (hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech). When bigger money became involved, they created their family Clinton Foundation and the money started pouring into it in the form of donations. Her criminal interactions had to be covered up, though. So, HRC was using her private email servers for that purpose while she was serving as secretary of state. That is why later, after the beginning of the Congressional investigation of their activities, the Clintons deleted all those emails, many of which contained government classified information, as they were directly incriminating Hillary Clinton in many shady dealings including selling access to the US Government to their rich foreign donors through the Clinton Foundation. Now, her corrupt friends from among the bankers and certain corporations are trying to use the mainstream news media to make her president, as Hillary Clinton has promised to continue to further consolidate the economic interests of certain private corporations with the political interests of the US Government. The corporate interest groups and the media are trying to make her look good and sound experienced. But in reality Hillary Clinton is not good and she has never been good at anything. Hillary Clinton is very corrupt. She has been corrupt all along. That was the only way she and her disbarred husband could have made such big money to support their lavish life style that they so got used to. However, Hillary and Bill Clinton have gone too far.She sold government contracts and political influence to the highest bidder, which of course were the biggest banks and largest corporations that ravaged the country and caused the financial and economic crisis in the US and the world over! Her corruption threatens to destroy US economy and the very existence of the union. Incompetent as a state official and immensely corrupt as a career politician, HRC is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, too corrupt, and too selfish and irresponsible to occupy the most demanding position in the world. HRC is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. If Hillary Clinton was to be elected president of the United States, the American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin!
12 | Liberty Brown | 10154745817569729_10154746610074729 | Russian Cyber Attack?  how about liar? corrupt government?  I get it, they dont want all that garbage revealed, like Obama lying about NOT knowing about Clintons private servers...it was lie and its in the e-mails he DID know.  Or how about the FBI being pressured by the President so they would not take any legal action against Hillary? or how about the DNC plotting against Berny Sanders (and him having no backbone bending over and taking it even AFTER he found out about it) Hillary Clinton endagering National Security?  How about the Clinton campaign setting up protests to start violence at Trump Rallies?  Or how about the actually PROVEN sexual predator Bill Clinton getting meeting together with Loretta Lynch, corrupt Judge, before the FBI made a decision about the wrong use of private servers the Hillary used? How about the democrats caught ON camera talking about how to cheat in the elections?  Interesting how the media is more interested and upset about WHO hacked the e-mails more so than the e-mails THEMSELVES!? Thats like saying I hacked into my friends computer, found a bunch of pictures of children being sexually abused by him and calling the cops...but of course the cops will put ME in handcuffs for hacking his computer, not HIM for SEXUALLY ABUSING KIDS?  It is shameful and embarrassing how uneducated the American population is that they fall for this kind of corruption and one sided media

19 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154745817569729_10154746433204729 | CROOKED DONALD TRUMP AND THE TRUMP CRIME FAMILY Spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire‚Äôs for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents.Those cases, which together used $258,000 from Trump‚Äôs charity, were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against ‚Äúself-dealing‚Äù ‚Äî which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses.In one case, from 2007, Trump‚Äôs Mar-a-Lago Club faced $120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach, Fla., resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole.In a settlement, Palm Beach agreed to waive those fines ‚Äî if Trump‚Äôs club made a $100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans. Instead, Trump sent a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity funded almost entirely by other people‚Äôs money, according to tax records.In another case, court papers say one of Trump‚Äôs golf courses in New York agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiff‚Äôs chosen charity. A $158,000 donation was made by the Trump Foundation, according to tax records.According to the report, Trump used Trump Foundation money, that would be money that was donated by other people to his charitable foundation to do charitable stuff, to pay for debts owed by Trump's personal businesses. This, however, is in keeping with Trump using Trump Foundation money for a political donation to Florida's Attorney General and to buy a portrait of him for his personal use. These all are covered by the IRS regulations prohibiting "self-dealing" by charitable organizations.New Information:  Trump asks those who owe him money to send it to his Trump Charity to avoid paying taxes on it.UPDATE: TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE THE PROPER CERTIFICATION TO SOLICIT OUTSIDE DONORS!

1 | Donovan Reiner | 10154745788159729_10154745818759729 | Trickle down economics have been a failure. YUGE tax cuts for the very rich, large corporations and special interest groups have FAILED to stimulate  the economy.
2 | Kenneth Givens | 10154745788159729_10154745891569729 | Hey Pence, why do you conservatives hang on to failed economic policies? The Obama Administration last year saw the highest gains in income and wealth by the Middle class in history.

The money sent to Iran was the return of a portion of Iran's own funds previously frozen by the US government back in 1979. We lost a decision in the world court and if the US failed to return funds would have been subjected to greater interest and penalties.

2 | Marti Eales-Kilby | 10154745428839729_10154745535994729 | If HRC gets elected she will be impeached in 6 months, and sent to prison. THis is what you will end up with. A turtle headed weasel for a president
3 | Bradley A. Hix | 10154745428839729_10154745466559729 | In the debate he said he was concerned with states killing convicted felons but had no problem with abortion. Pro-Abortion Catholic very rare and will never receive my vote.
4 | Suzanne Burch | 10154745428839729_10154745481204729 | Those emails are a joke. Russia has a hand in them so that automatically says they have doctored in some way to make her and her people look bad. Donald probably on on it from the beginning.  He's the crook
5 | Shannon Mendenhall | 10154745428839729_10154745852659729 | They're awful to watch, at times criminal in nature, but the rigged election tapes spell out Hillary everytime...so the simple folk can follow along too!

24 | Vance Voppleplith | 10154745428839729_10154745555574729 | right, he said we'd have to wait and see if Ivanka's tits are as nice as Melania's. He was talking about her when she was a baby.
25 | John Davidson | 10154745428839729_10154745467399729 | Donald, I recommend you fill out an application as an intern with Hillary's cabinet. Not claiming your qualified but based on your statements understanding and representing our government isn't something you teach to an old dog over the course of a campaign. VOTE BLUE

5 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154745154694729_10154745503754729 | The Sad True Story of Hillary ClintonThis is the sad story of Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton and her husband got very used to their luxurious life style while Bill was the President.However, after his presidency had ended, Bill Clinton having being disbarred for perjury, the Clintons could not continue their luxurious habits. They could not practice law, so Bill and Hillary Clinton decided to use their political connections to make real big money. They started lobbying the interests of the big banks and corporations!That is why Bill Clinton became the proponent of the notorious financial deregulation movement that eventually destroyed US economy. Bill and Hillary Clinton helped the largest banks have US financial industry essentially deregulated, which resulted in the 2008 financial crisis. The bankers were happy and the Clintons could enjoy the privileges of the upper class. From then on, Hillary Clinton dedicated her life to representing the interests of the big banks and corporations in exchange for money that was given to her and Bill in the form of payment for their speeches (hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech). When bigger money became involved, they created they family Clinton Foundation and the money started pouring in in the form of donations. Her criminal interactions had to be covered up. So, Hillary was using her private email servers for that purpose all along. That is why they deleted all those emails, as they were directly incriminating Hillary Clinton in many shady dealings including selling access to the US Government for their rich donors through the Clinton Foundation. Now, her corrupt friends from among the bankers and certain corporations are trying to use the mainstream news media to make her president. They try to make her look good and sound experienced. But she is not good and she has never been good at anything. She was corrupt all along. That was the only way she and her disbarred husband could have made big money to support their lavish life style they so got used to.She sold government contracts and political influence to the highest bidder, which of course were the biggest banks and largest corporations that ravaged the country and caused the financial and economic crisis in the US and the world over! Hillary Clinton is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, corrupt, and selfish for the most demanding position in the world. Hillary Clinton is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. The American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin.

What ever happened to 2-source verification.  Anything less equates to media bias and false representation.  Mainly, the Liberal Media has failed to honestly critique Democratic candidates at least on an equal basis as they do Republican candidates. The Liberal media engages in character assassination and they are doing it to hundreds of decent people across this country who totally reject their political beliefs. Not only is the Liberal Media complacent in character assassination...they are aiding and abetting in it's conduct.Since I disdain everything they stand for, I expect them to continue on with their assaults on Republican candidates across the country.  If people want to listen to an believe the trash they spout, then by all means do so.  But the Democratic Party sucks...anyone that is one of them and engaged in character assassination sucks, and I for one will never vote for even one Democrat because of it.  When they engage in character assassination using deceit and lies...that is what their subjects are voting for to represent them in our government.

12 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154742706819729_10154746475984729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.1st DEBATE ~ EPIC FAILURE ON DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS PART!  AND THIS GUY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT???  I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO!  HILLARY CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE, HANDS DOWN!!!#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence
13 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154742706819729_10154746475469729 | SO THE NARCISSISTIC PATHOLOGICAL SERIAL LIAR, THE GUY WHO ASSAULTS, RAPES AND DEMEANS WOMEN ASKS:  "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE"???As a Black, Muslim, Gay AND A Woman. EVERYTHING!!Here is why:1. The misogynistic pathetic small man has shown over and over again throughout his life he has zero respect for women. He has said cringe worthy horrible/outrageous things about women all his life. He has consistently insulted, belittled, sexualized, and stereotyped women. Such insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land. And he has promised to nominate conservative justices who will limit women's reproductive rights & women's ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Just a little history here: "In the 1950s, estimates of numbers of illegal, unsafe abortions ranged widely, from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. The methods used were often ineffective and dangerous. Desperate women were driven into the back alley, where they endured danger and abuse, sometimes sexual." Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there‚Äôs no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. As a woman I can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. So as a woman I have everything to lose. 2.  I was raised in a Muslim family, even though I no longer consider myself a practicing Muslim. So that xenophobic con man's hate-filled rhetoric is a direct attack on my family and I. So as a Muslim American, I can NOT have afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as him. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believe people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. So as a Muslim American I have everything to lose. 3. As a black person I can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. A racist person whose campaign rallies looks like a klan gathering. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights. So as a black American I have everything to lose. 4. As a lesbian I can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT think I should marry whoever my heart desire. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years, I cannot afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back years. So as a gay citizen, I have everything to lose. 5. As a proud citizen of this great country who believes in American values I can NOT afford to have a self-serving, greedy, pathological liar, con-man who is walking all over those values as a president. To the white people who are not motivated by hate and resentment but still support Trump, I as a minority would like to ask you to think about how Trump's presidency affect me and people like me. I would like to sincerely ask you to reconsider your support for him. Please. To the people who are planning to vote for a third party candidate: I would like to ask you to think really, really hard. Especially, if you care about progressive ideas and believe Trump presidency will take us back decades on the progress we have made on women issues, LGBT issues...etc. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. So if you believe the con-man is unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and dangerous please reconsider voting for Hillary Clinton and vote blue up and down the ballot.Trump and Pence show extreme contempt towards Gays, LGBT and LGBTQ.  Both on are record as being ANTI-GAY!A vote for Trump is a lost vote - he will not become the next president of The United States of America!It is paramount that The President of The United States of America is a sane, intelligent, curious, controlled person, who is a reliable, detail-oriented, steadfast, cautious and methodical person without whom organizations and society would dissolve (fall apart). Hillary fits the aforementioned description! She is a woman, who can keep her cool!Trump on the other hand is non-reflecting and ruthless character, who lacks emphatic traits under non-sexual circumstances. He is extremely nervous and very emotional driven. He completely lacks self-knowledge! He is little bothered by second thoughts and self-doubt. That doesn't mean he is smart but that he is rather dumb. His knowledge is in general extremely limited. Since he does not reflect on his errors or analyze any mistakes to any great extent - Trump is incapable to learn from his errors, and so he will be caught in a loop, repeating his mistakes, which can have catastrophic consequences for the US, the rest of the world and possible beyond depending on the nature of his actions.In all fairness in the Vice Presidential debate Tuesday night, October 4, 2016, Mike Pence acted far more "vice presidential" than Tim Kaine, who was rude and insulting as well as he was talking over Mike Pence, who just had to sit there and take it.HOWEVER, Trump would still do the right thing if he voluntarily steps down from the presidential election campaign. Whether he steps down or not he will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America!DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO FIRE NANCY O‚ÄôDELL AFTER SHE REJECTED HIS ADVANCES!  HOW COME HE HASN‚ÄôT APOLOGIZED TO HER?  HIS APOLOGY MEANS NOTHING !!!PROMINATE GOP LEADERS ARE DITCHING DONALD TRUMP IS DROVES.  THE RNC STOPS WORK ON THE ‚ÄúVICTORY‚Äù PROJECT AND PULLS FUNDING FOR DONALD TRUMP !!!DONALD TRUMP RAPED HIS 1ST WIFE, IVANA.

Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton arrives in Vegas and walks down the stairs from her plane and into her waiting car like a zombie...wearing shades to cover the bags under her eyes....lots of work in the spa today and with the makeup artist and the drug pusher!! American journalism is dead....and will possibly never recover because real America does not trust the media and with good reason. Want a real scare....just think if we did not have the internet and social media. Now I am going to 'struggle' down to the our old country store for coffee with the farmers and old farts like me.

18 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154742706819729_10154745504299729 | The Sad True Story of Hillary ClintonThis is the sad story of Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton and her husband got very used to their luxurious life style while Bill was the President.However, after his presidency had ended, Bill Clinton having being disbarred for perjury, the Clintons could not continue their luxurious habits. They could not practice law, so Bill and Hillary Clinton decided to use their political connections to make real big money. They started lobbying the interests of the big banks and corporations!That is why Bill Clinton became the proponent of the notorious financial deregulation movement that eventually destroyed US economy.

Hillary Clinton is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, corrupt, and selfish for the most demanding position in the world. Hillary Clinton is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. The American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin.

What are you going to do or say when one nuke takes out one full city in an instant, one flash and it's gone? What are you going to tell the American people, why you did this? What are you going to tell the world as to why you did this? What are you going to tell God Almighty as to why you did this? Are you really all that sick or do you hate men that much because that's the way it looks to me? And Nancy, I'm only talking about one nuke. What about a hundred nukes or five hundred or more? If you live, who are you going to tell it to, yourself? Because you might be the only one left. You Nancy are one complete nutcase, you must even hate yourself...

Republicans have good reason to want to make sure people have confidence in the results of the election.

1 | Rob Visconti | 10154742357979729_10154742479459729 | Republicans stay home and boycott the election if it is rigged. What's the point? You say it's rigged after all. Democrats and Independents will take care of all the voting on Election Day for you Republicans:
2 | Kevin Lynch | 10154742357979729_10154742521859729 | Guilianni has been bitch in about dead people voting. If it was a problem then the Republicans would not have been elected to run the country for the past ten yrs.Few understand that it is the obstructionist Republicans who have stopped American progress.They are also at fault for the opiate problem as they were paid by pharmaceuticals to allow the problem.
3 | Danny Babcock | 10154742357979729_10154742825034729 | I've watched five (CBS) ‚ÄúLive‚Äù, full telecasts of Trump rallies, and what I saw was a Lunatic in action! Wow! Trump is absolutely insane.... get the net! Wow... he's come unglued! Add to that, Trump's starting his Excuses Phase right now. He knows he's in trouble, so it's the Media, it‚Äôs the Clintons, it‚Äôs the Establishment, his shorts are too tight, it‚Äôs the rigged and corrupt system that's doing it to Trump. If the election could be rigged, the GOP sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt have Trump as their nominee right now. What an Absolute fool... he is listening to the voices coming to him on the aluminum foil receiver in his red hat.

7 | Frances Scott | 10154742357979729_10154742880174729 | Joe HallHussein Obama just had to make yet another Rose Garden speech today...and disagreed sharply with Mr. Trump that the election system is rigged and said that Trump should stop whining....very interesting from a fraud belonging to a party that recently rigged its own primary. Democrats have been rigging elections since Hector was a hound...reference LBJ in Texas....and the Obama election where there were Black Panthers intimidating voters and the districts in which more people voted for Obama than were registered!!!!! This man is a total disgrace to the office of POTUS.....he came in as the most unprepared, unaccomplished, undeserving, and ignorant president ever and is leaving the very same way!! It will take lots and lots of effort the remove the stench from our WH and Rose Garden...but it shall be done. Trump 2016!!
8 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154742357979729_10154745504464729 | The Sad True Story of Hillary ClintonThis is the sad story of Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton and her husband got very used to their luxurious life style while Bill was the President.However, after his presidency had ended, Bill Clinton having being disbarred for perjury, the Clintons could not continue their luxurious habits. They could not practice law, so Bill and Hillary Clinton decided to use their political connections to make real big money. They started lobbying the interests of the big banks and corporations!That is why Bill Clinton became the proponent of the notorious financial deregulation movement that eventually destroyed US economy. Bill and Hillary Clinton helped the largest banks have US financial industry essentially deregulated, which resulted in the 2008 financial crisis. The bankers were happy and the Clintons could enjoy the privileges of the upper class. From then on, Hillary Clinton dedicated her life to representing the interests of the big banks and corporations in exchange for money that was given to her and Bill in the form of payment for their speeches (hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech). When bigger money became involved, they created they family Clinton Foundation and the money started pouring in in the form of donations. Her criminal interactions had to be covered up.

Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton arrives in Vegas and walks down the stairs from her plane and into her waiting car like a zombie...wearing shades to cover the bags under her eyes....lots of work in the spa today and with the makeup artist and the drug pusher!! American journalism is dead....and will possibly never recover because real America does not trust the media and with good reason.

All planned by the fascist New World Order elites!IT IS CALLED PROPAGANDA PEOPLE PLAIN AND SIMPLE IT IS PROPAGANDA...Showing Hillary Leading by Double Digits IS TOTAL FRAUDS.It felt wrong‚Ä¶.. and now we know for a fact our skepticism was correct. The national polls showing Hillary with a double digit lead have been proven to be completely fraudulent as they are using unrealistic sample sizes heavily weighted towards democrats.It is completely fixed.

23 | Anne Warby | 10154741977349729_10154742144254729 | A lot can come out about Killary, between now and November 8th!!http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/wikileaks-confirms-hillary-sold-weapons-isis-drops-another-bombshell-breaking-news/
24 | Steve Glanstein | 10154741977349729_10154742161109729 | Aren't the odds for getting struck by lightening less than the occurrences of voter fraud?
25 | Gregory Stoner | 10154741977349729_1387315054630424 | If the people wanted to do the right thing. They should vote for Bernie Sanders the only trueful candidate. Even if you have to write him in .

1 | Kim Mie | 10154741973234729_10154742026059729 | My intuition tells me Evidence will eventually show this was done by a paid Trumpf supporter but that party likes to blame Dems for their actions.
2 | Cynthia K. Turner | 10154741973234729_10154742198984729 | Pence is nuts just like Trump. He too is pushing conspiracy theory that election is rigged. Its called projection. Yes, it's rigged by not against Republicans. Its rigged against Democrats. Voter supression tactics throughout the U.S. are alive and well. Why? Because most states are controlled by Republicans. Now this is fact.
3 | Kevin Lynch | 10154741973234729_10154742502749729 | Puppet Pence in case you missed it let me bring you up to datenTrump hijacked the Republican party. Trump then attempted to turn the general election into a Jerry Springer special edition and it exploded in his face as out came 17 women that were sexually assaulted by the wealthy Trump after he said that he can grab the pus-- because he is wealthy.
4 | Cheryl Heymans | 10154741973234729_10154742001649729 | And has there been evidence that "Hillary's animals" were to blame?Pence/Trump are as much embarrassments to America as Hillary/Kaine are but for different reasons. Thank goodness we have a better choice - Jill Stein!
5 | Di Roy | 10154741973234729_10154742094874729 | Pence just said that a man always slept on that sofa every night -- let me guess, he was out setting the fire that night!! Do they think everyone is uneducated and deplorable?
6 | Patricia Holtby | 10154741973234729_10154742012554729 | Did he mention it was the Democrats who raised the money to rebuild the office?
7 | Annie Mendelsohn | 10154741973234729_10154741977169729 | Pence lied 78% of the time during his debate, don't believe anything he says he is lacking values.
8 | Randy Goldstein | 10154741973234729_10154742062019729 | It's not often i agree with Pence. He's right that the media should not blame the victims of violence as the first question clearly did. For the sake of polite political discourse, it would have been nice had he mentioned the $13,000 Dems raise to help rebuild the office.http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37673802
9 | Bob N. Batchelder | 10154741973234729_10154742048224729 | Pence could not bring himself to thank local Democrats for their fund raising to collect over $10,000 to repair the damage
10 | Frances Scott | 10154741973234729_10154744589734729 | Joe Hall1 hr ¬∑ CNN reporting from Las Vegas this morning that Trump will try to use his debate performance to resurrect his 'struggling' campaign....these political hacks and bought and paid for wanna be journalists are disgusting and despicable....please define 'struggling' for me if you will...do you mean overflow crowds at every venue....do you mean lots and lots of money coming in by small donations from real Americans and not from the mega bankers and Wall Street goons....do you mean tremendous energy and passion and enthusiasm displayed by Mr. Trump and his supporters??? Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton arrives in Vegas and walks down the stairs from her plane and into her waiting car like a zombie...wearing shades to cover the bags under her eyes....lots of work in the spa today and with the makeup artist and the drug pusher!! American journalism is dead....and will possibly never recover because real America does not trust the media and with good reason. Want a real scare....just think if we did not have the internet and social media. Now I am going to 'struggle' down to the our old country store for coffee with the farmers and old farts like me. Blessings!!
11 | Logan Anderson | 10154741973234729_10154742176799729 | Hmmmm. Why do I keep thinking of the Reichstag fire the Nazis set but blamed on Germany's Jews?
12 | Donna Philbrook | 10154741973234729_10154742472929729 | what are you teaching your children with all this bull shit bashing
13 | Kevin Lynch | 10154741973234729_10154742493524729 | The bombing is the work of the socialist party as they don't like the Democrats nor capitalism and they hate the Republicans.
14 | Larry Dennis | 10154741973234729_10154742315969729 | Vote online for hillary make your vote count. If you do not have internet access all voting polls are expecting massive voting to take place on November 9th the Democratic Party awaits you.
15 | Charles Bush | 10154741973234729_10154741984544729 | Their #Trump hats should have been put into the fire
16 | Stacy Phillips | 10154741973234729_10154742105979729 | Fire Bombed? Sounds like the KKK...ya know Trump's deplorable supporters.
17 | Beth Lynn Stephens | 10154741973234729_10154741989754729 | This is a one sided election. Either be for Hillary or else.
18 | John Taylor | 10154741973234729_10154742003284729 | Great recession was a financial fraud that BANKSTERS are doing time for in Iceland and Ireland BUT NOT here...it bankrupted millions while Obama looked the other way now Hillary is looking the other way....Average wage in expensive cities is $42k rents $1800...immigrants a cheap resource for rich businesses who pay just ten cents in wages for every DOLLAR they make...tuition degrees cost $70k people buried in student loans and credit card debt after being cheated by employers...govt can make FAIR WAGE legislation to tie wages to PROFITS and as TRUMP has suggested exempt those making under $50k from taxes!
19 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154741973234729_10154745505549729 | The Sad True Story of Hillary ClintonThis is the sad story of Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton and her husband got very used to their luxurious life style while Bill was the President.However, after his presidency had ended, Bill Clinton having being disbarred for perjury, the Clintons could not continue their luxurious habits. They could not practice law, so Bill and Hillary Clinton decided to use their political connections to make real big money. They started lobbying the interests of the big banks and corporations!That is why Bill Clinton became the proponent of the notorious financial deregulation movement that eventually destroyed US economy. Bill and Hillary Clinton helped the largest banks have US financial industry essentially deregulated, which resulted in the 2008 financial crisis. The bankers were happy and the Clintons could enjoy the privileges of the upper class. From then on, Hillary Clinton dedicated her life to representing the interests of the big banks and corporations in exchange for money that was given to her and Bill in the form of payment for their speeches (hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech). When bigger money became involved, they created they family Clinton Foundation and the money started pouring in in the form of donations. Her criminal interactions had to be covered up. So, Hillary was using her private email servers for that purpose all along. That is why they deleted all those emails, as they were directly incriminating Hillary Clinton in many shady dealings including selling access to the US Government for their rich donors through the Clinton Foundation. Now, her corrupt friends from among the bankers and certain corporations are trying to use the mainstream news media to make her president. They try to make her look good and sound experienced. But she is not good and she has never been good at anything. She was corrupt all along. That was the only way she and her disbarred husband could have made big money to support their lavish life style they so got used to.She sold government contracts and political influence to the highest bidder, which of course were the biggest banks and largest corporations that ravaged the country and caused the financial and economic crisis in the US and the world over! Hillary Clinton is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, corrupt, and selfish for the most demanding position in the world. Hillary Clinton is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. The American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin.
20 | Tim Janke | 10154741973234729_10154742061889729 | Not QUITE the Reichstag.
21 | Reid Scott Anderson | 10154741973234729_10154742074884729 | Total Reichstag inside job
22 | D M Morrison | 10154741973234729_10154745084184729 | Is this the HQ that the Dems raised money to rebuild?
23 | Blogging Dan | 10154741973234729_10154741978334729 | Trump knows how most Americans live? Oh, c'mon kid.
24 | Dale Leier | 10154741973234729_10154742386324729 | Hillary did it...she donned her costume and climbed on her broomstick late at night, flew across the country, and then dropped it down the chimney if the Trumpkins are to be believed.
25 | Paul John Gavagan | 10154741973234729_10154742015614729 | Ahhh. The tolerant left
