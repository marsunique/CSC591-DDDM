In the first of his speeches on this last day of campaigning before Election Day, Pres. Barack Obama today framed a Hillary Clinton presidency as the natural continuation of his own, urging voters to be as excited for her election as they were for his own.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Donald Vormelker | 36 | 10154988926478812_10154988938148812 | He tells illegals to vote, that is a violation of the law. I thought he was a constitutional lawyer? He apparently doesn't know the constitution. Worst President in history leaving soon.
2 | Janie Hilburn | 15 | 10154988926478812_10154988940423812 | Nothing Obama has done in 8yrs has benifited the American population. The system is absolutly corrupt. A win for Hillary is a loss for our Grandkids.
3 | Shawn Arkebauer | 25 | 10154988926478812_10154988929403812 | Americans and legal immigrants and veterans and border patrol and police and GOD fearing people and working people for Trump. Celebrity millionaires and millionaire Wall Street cronies and deadbeats and foreign donors for Clinton. Think of NAFTA and other trade deals, insurance premiums skyrocketing, and 20 TRILLION in debt and climbing. Sorry, I do not have time to reply back to people that do not see this.
4 | Pamela Schilke | 10 | 10154988926478812_10154988939753812 | He should be paying for air force one out of his pocket since he's only out campaigning and not on official business for all the American citizens. Campaigning for Hillary isn't in his job description.
5 | Cheryl Havlicek | 8 | 10154988926478812_10154988936018812 | If Hillary Clinton is without guilt, then it's time to demand the FBI reverse charges on General Cartwright, Christian Saucier, and General Petraeus. It's time we DEMAND EQUALITY!
6 | Gail Chirichella | 0 | 10154988926478812_10154988944378812 | Obama tells the truth about Crooked Hillary scheming and Beaming. Evidently she was crooked back then in 2008 and she's still crooked now in 2016. Finally Obama sees the truth and he just couldn't keep it to himself.
7 | Kevin Jones | 0 | 10154988926478812_10154988954958812 | His presidency kind of sucked.  Wages are down, wars continue, the middle east has fallen to radicals, and his crowing achievement, Obamacare, is going down in flames as we speak.
8 | Todd K McCollum | 1 | 10154988926478812_10154988950823812 | IF Hillary was really leading like you say she is...... She wouldn't be campaigning in Person anywhere, her surrogates would be. She wouldn't need big name celebrities to draw crowds to her events. She would be able to do that on her own, but she can't & do you know why?? She's losing & losing BIG, nobody want to listen to her speak.
9 | Jeanne Clevenger | 1 | 10154988926478812_10154988946228812 | It costs the American taxpayer $206,000 an hour when Obama travels in our plane. He leaves behind a national debt of $19,500,000,000,000. His legacy, Obamacare, is sucking the life blood out of the middle class. One would think he might stay at his job and try to fix something.
10 | Yvonne Clerebout | 8 | 10154988926478812_10154988933068812 | I get a chuckle out of the libtards thinking that the Hildebeast will win because the FBI closed one of the two cases they have her on. Trump voters outnumber the brain dead by millions. We've got this! #spiritcooking #lolitaexpress #wikileaks #projectveritas #vincefoster #draintheswamp
11 | Leo Decaj | 25 | 10154988926478812_10154988927143812 | When you go to the polls on November 8th, remember this: Donald Trump is willing to spend millions of his own dollars on a movement to make America great again, while Hillary Clinton has spent the last 30 years selling out the American people for millions of dollars from foreign governments and special interests
12 | Clint Cerro | 0 | 10154988926478812_10154988951933812 | Does campaigning actually work anymore?  I am serious,  I think the people running put way to much faith in it.
13 | Johnny Meller | 0 | 10154988926478812_10154988953933812 | Nobody is excited for a criminal and corrupt cheater to get into office. Sorry but i would rather vote a dog into office atleast they love their fellow humans.
14 | Barbara Healey | 16 | 10154988926478812_10154988928708812 | I've lost all respect for Clinton. She doesn't stand for the people, she stands for corruption. Wikileaks dumped more than 2050 emails that contained copies of Hillary Clinton's speeches to Goldman Sachs. Now her Chief of Staff copied Confidential emails to her husband's laptop. Other people have gone to prison for this same activity.  Question - why did her aides need to be granted immunity by the FBI before they testified? If she is innocent then immunity isn't needed. I'm beginning to follow GARY JOHNSON and BILL WELD. Both are former Governors who really helped their states. They have to be better than Clinton and Trump! In the emails and speeches, Clinton states that Johnson is her greatest rival. At least JOHNSON/WELD talks about the issues! Don't let them tell you you're wasting your vote, the only wasted vote is one that supports continued corruption.
15 | John LeStarge | 10 | 10154988926478812_10154988932058812 | Just think we could be 1 day away from the corrupt Clinton machine being gone forever! :)Vote Trump! 🇺🇸
16 | Bill Giampolo | 5 | 10154988926478812_10154988941528812 | Wow Doesn't he have a job to do? Flying all over the globe what happened to global warming and climate change. Thats a big carbon footprint! Vote Trump!
17 | Anna Riggi | 10 | 10154988926478812_10154988929713812 | Your administration was corrupt so you can be sure Hillary will follow suit.
18 | Joshua Watson | 4 | 10154988926478812_10154988930393812 | It's amazing how many people support the murder of children. Women mostly cause they don't want kids yet can't keep their legs closed!
19 | Donna Fermo | 4 | 10154988926478812_10154988933468812 | Funny when she was running against you, you were singing a different song! HYPOCRITE!
20 | Izzy Nikki | 3 | 10154988926478812_10154988934803812 | Further more reasoning to NOT vote for her, a continuation of his presidency.. #teamtrump
21 | Lou Michaels | 0 | 10154988926478812_10154988953593812 | "The Clintons"12 rapes121 mysterious deaths1 dead Ambassador3 Navy Seals Dead10 investigations 1 impeachment 2 disbarments30,000 emails deleted AFTER a Congressional Subpoena, Etc...Nothing to see here keep voting...
22 | Michael Hirak | 2 | 10154988926478812_10154988943208812 | PLEASE. Don't allow big business, foreign interests, and the Media to brainwash you. Take an HONEST look at Hillary's record while a Senator and as Secretary of State.. She did NOTHING As a Senator, her greatest deed was to RENAME A POST OFFICE.. Don't take my word, look online at independent site that rate her performance. As Secretary of State, she helped ruin the Middle East. VOTE TRUMP.
23 | KevinKelly GladysSmith | 3 | 10154988926478812_10154988930543812 | FBI CLOSED INVESTIGATION SAY NO NEW HILLARY E MAILS AND HILLARY INNOCENT......VOTE HILLARY
24 | Juancho Velez | 1 | 10154988926478812_10154988947908812 | 8 years ago she was the worst now she's the most qualified lady to be president ever how can I trust Obama and as a Latino I don't want another 4 to 8 years of family's deportations
25 | Eric Rabinowitz | 1 | 10154988926478812_10154988939073812 | INDEPENDENT / UNDECIDED VOTERS AREN'T MORONS. They know the news media has been influencing the electorate with fluff stories to distract from the FBI's criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's family Foundation's pay to play scheme with her State Department. The choice is simple; bigger government with higher taxes and rising ObamaCare costs, NAFTA-like Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), open borders, and government school conformity under Hillary Clinton or smaller government with lower taxes to attract more investment into building and bringing back industry to the US, interstate competition for lower-cost health care, secure borders, and school choice for all.

With the election just a day away, here’s a look back at Hillary Clinton's and Donald J. Trump's biggest social moments on the campaign trail. http://abcn.ws/2eFSYz7

1 | Andrei Scutea | 12 | 10154988876073812_10154988880358812 | You got terrorist making bomb factories in San Bernardino, Boston, NY....etc. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡Obama hasn't done anything to Secure America because he was campaigning for corrupt Hillary Clinton in his 8 years. In some states like Ohio the terrorists are trying to attack our nuclear power plants. Speak the truth you disgusting bias media! Nothing but lies about his gun control law who aren't working in this last weekend in Chicago.
2 | Jason Kerr | 11 | 10154988876073812_10154988880703812 | Do not be distracted! Democrats want open borders, higher taxes, more "refugees" & illegals, weakened military & police, abolish the 2nd Amendment, Leftist judges, more BLM, and more islamic influence. THAT IS NOT A CHOICE!!!!! Trump/Pence 2016!
3 | Irene Rohn Bain | 1 | 10154988876073812_10154988901998812 | Why are you making this kind of news? Why aren't you talking about the differences in what their plans are? What they want to do when they are elected? All we hear about your is he-said-she-said stuff. Help us out here!
4 | Todd Dorsey | 1 | 10154988876073812_10154988911908812 | For those of you who still haven't voted yet the because you haven't had a chance or because you don't know who to vote for it's pretty simple. Are you happy with the way things have gone the last eight years are you happy with our economy, our  standing in the world , with the unemployment,  the way our vets have been treated, our 20 trillion in debt, high tuition costs, giving Iran billions, giving 50% of our uranium to putin, etc. If you're happy with all those things then the choice is clear then you should vote for Hillary because you cannot blame anything on trump. He as not been in office. Hillary's hands are all over all of the decisions that have been made in the last 8 years.
5 | Mike Hopkins | 0 | 10154988876073812_10154988906108812 | Never thought that "smart" people would be worse than pro wrestling fans but damn, this election proved me wrong. Now the only thing I wonder is, who's gonna cry tomorrow?
6 | Gerry Klepfer | 0 | 10154988876073812_10154988918758812 | It's a shame the democrats can't get the votes they need from African Americans so they gave up on them and shift there alliance to Latinos who half of them are illegals but they just keep letting them selfs to be used
7 | We stand with Israel | 0 | 10154988876073812_10154988919598812 | Here in Israel we support TRUMP! Obama was truly one of the worst presidents the United States ever had, Clinton will be the same.

10 | Victoria Lynn | 2 | 10154988876073812_10154988898408812 | Hillary is an old rich lady with a penchant for lying, a philandering husband, alcohol problems, and a heap of corpses behind her..She isn't fit to be President. Vote Trump✔✔✔

13 | Bryan Barnes | 1 | 10154988876073812_10154988907763812 | Twas the night before the election and all through the house....not a creature was stirring, except a computer mouse. The emails were deleted from the server with care.....in fear that the FBI soon would be there. Hillary and Bill are asleep and all snug in their beds....Dreaming of the time that Hillary was still ahead.  Hillary wants a win but instead gets a coal lump......because tomorrow the Americans elect President Trump. And so she's defeated and still dreams of what could have been.....for the following day We The People MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!
14 | M Kay Gianopolis | 1 | 10154988876073812_10154988918353812 | So we all know HRC will win but will she win by a landslide or will it be close?
15 | Peggy Hodge | 1 | 10154988876073812_10154988899173812 | If Hillary wins kiss our country good bye. Our government is controlling too much of our freedom as it is. Did you see on the news this morning about a woman with 6 children being threatened by the government for selling ceviche on fb. to help support her kids. They want to put her in jail for a year or take a plea deal. Why? The government not get their 2 cents in tax from her? Why are they picking on a woman trying to support her family, where is her freedom? Hillary did a lot more then her and is running for president. We need change and we wont get it with Hillary.
16 | Virginia Perez | 1 | 10154988876073812_10154988878183812 | I can't wait for these two old friends, Clinton and Trump, to pretend to kiss and make up on Wednesday. Wink-wink. They just punked a lot of stupid people while increasing racial tension. Two birds one stone. Hopefully these peasants will be a problem which will take care of itself.

Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:21. And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding.Colossians 1:16For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him and for himRomans 13:1Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.1 Peter 3:22Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authoritiesand powers being made subject unto him.So my prayer, is, and should be of every christian, that God have mercy. America has turned it's back on God for so long now, we are reaping what we have sowed.Proverbs 1:22-3222. How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?23. Turn ye at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.24. Because i have called, and ye refused: I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;25. But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:26. I will also laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;27. When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.28. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:29. For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord:30. They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.31. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.This is the word of God, Hear his wordAnd obey his wordThen shall he restore his grace upon ustheir scorning

We’ve had enough with you cashing on broken borders and rigged trade policies that make you rich and hollow out and destroy our communities, leaving us to pick up the shattered pieces and lives. Establishment: We the People are done with us working folks living under one set of laws and you committing egregious crimes and never paying any price whatsoever.

We were walking through the gate to get on the plane and we were stopped because her koala bears hand was sticking out and they pulled us aside and asked to look in her bag. Once they knew it was a stuffed toy, security asked what her koala bears name was, and she said looked up and said "Peter rabbit"...what made it even more cute was that she couldn't really say her r's. Whenever I see a koala bear, I always think, Peter rabbit ;)

Donald J. Trump is holding 5 events in 5 states in 12 hours today, while Hillary Clinton is starting her day in Pittsburgh, then stopping in Michigan, before returning to Pennsylvania.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Johnny Washika Gachago | 94 | 10154988659183812_10154988663383812 | Im not a Trump supporter, just don't like the way the media seems to be favoring Hilary everywhere and twisting Trump's word. That alone right there should question whether if the system is rigged for pne candidate or not
2 | Eddie Kostlevy | 70 | 10154988659183812_10154988669743812 | I like it how the media questions everything Trump does and says he should do something else.That sort of means he is doing the right thing.Like it was why did he go to minnesota.He didn't hold a rally with a rapper using foul language in front of children or a women that uses a stripper pole which i like but not for a presidential endorsement.
3 | Mauriel Cantrell | 36 | 10154988659183812_10154988674238812 | I don't like either candidate. However, presentation is important. The president is a representative, if you will, of our country. People from all over the world, our allies & enemies, judge us in large part, by the demeanor of our leader as he/she speaks. Trump has no filter. He cannot handle criticism. He cannot handle opposing views. He cannot handle a tough situation. He throws a fit like a belligerent, childish man, even during speeches. He makes the most obscure, immature, irresponsible remarks. All for the world to see. Hillary, is able to maintain her composure, at least act professional & has a filter when on camera. These qualities are very important when the world is watching.I had originally planned to vote third party. Now I've decided this election, isn't the election to do that. I'll be giving Hillary my vote to help keep sociopathic Trump, out.
4 | Brian Eubanks | 11 | 10154988659183812_10154988664423812 | When this election is over will you be proud of how you acted? Will you be able to say you showed dignity and were honest or did you hurl insults and spread lies? I don't mean will you be satisfied with the results and think that the ends justified the means but will you truly believe that you showed respect, dignity and honesty.
5 | Alice De Sanctis | 14 | 10154988659183812_10154988678248812 | He can go to all the states he needs to Pennsylvania is a battle ground state and she has taken the time out to go above and beyond meeting with families supporters. I just hope we make the right choice. I just don't understand what trump would do besides just wanting to say he accomplished something else in life.
6 | Claudia Bee Malcolm | 0 | 10154988659183812_10154988903363812 | We already knew Donald Trump Path is for him to win all the battle ground states..plus turning a blue state red..He can't..Therefore he will not win.
7 | Lori Chapman-stinnett | 1 | 10154988659183812_10154988864423812 | Because she's Old and has No stamina. .... He has outcampaigned her through this whole process... She just sucks up and brings in money! Considering, Our voted Don't count, why waste all this money on an elaborate campaign for the people?! Imagine what could be done with the Millions that have been wasted on the campaigns?! The people it could feed? The roads and bridges that could be fixed? The little houses that could be built for veterans.... With the Millions of dollars!!! Our system Sucks!
8 | Anki Ågren | 0 | 10154988659183812_10154988734553812 | I hope there is many sensible people in your country that have the good taste NOT to vote for Trump!!!!! He is a psycopatic unstable racist sexistisk bully that will make the climat change worse! And who wants him in charge of your nuclear codes😭👿😱 Its time for a women and she is an experienced one, i read her biography, she has the love and engagement from the 60thies to now to make changes to the better in your country and she is a new grandmother she will think of familys./Say all of us in Europe
9 | Patrick Kelly | 6 | 10154988659183812_10154988678348812 | he can campaign wherever he wants, the die has been cast.  the second he showed all his sociopathic tendencies towards minorities, women, immigrants, not to mention the general public by being too good to turn his house inside out and show us his finances.  this is Clinton's presidency to lose at this point.  vote wisely America.
10 | David Sammy Jr. | 4 | 10154988659183812_10154988678638812 | Don't be fooled by Trump and his antics he's looking for sympathy votes this whole episode was staged his life was not threatened..Can Trump just rush on out this election so that America can be brought back to some sought of normalcy...???
11 | Beverly Belt Warta | 1 | 10154988659183812_10154988801573812 | Trump is a brilliant con man, he deals with the powerful and wealthy across the world, obtaining property to better himself and his corporations. Hillary is a die hard politician, who has also dealt with the powerful wealthy people across the world. Tomorrow one will gain the power and control of this nation, neither of them has my trust or my faith in believing that they are for the better of our country. They both lie, cheat, steal, and are corrupted in their ways. Dems want Hillary and Reps wanted Trump till he admitted that woman want to be grabbed, manipulated and abused by other men. Both are being sought after for charges of one thing or another and to say that this is the best that we have to run and represent the U.S is appalling to say the least. We had better candidates on the ballot but not much of a glance in their direction because voting by popularity seems to control the outcome. It's like being in high school and try to decide who's the most popular to vote Prom King and Queen. Sad that we are puppets in a major control conspiracy by those that tell us we are democrats or republican as long as we don't think for ourselves and want to take a stand at what we know we don't want, yet pick what we are programmed too. Two grown adults that had so much to do and say yet belittled each other till the end. Trump once liked the Clintons but I'm sure he was brown nosing them for gain of his own standing in society. Clintons looked to up to Trump and also brown nosed to gain wealth for electoral votes and campaign money. We the people of this great nation had better choices to decide from, I for one like someone that enjoys rubbing elbows with common folk such as myself and took good ideas from both candidates and wanted change and  reform from the bad choices of past presidents! It's a sad shame that one of these two will sit in the most powerful house in the nation and determine not just our future but the future of our children,  grandchildren and every generation after, providing we survive!!

13 | Edward Shay | 4 | 10154988659183812_10154988711683812 | Hillary is in Pittsburgh, what a joke. She doesn't care about the industry that was lost or sent to Mexico or China. She also wants to shut down the coal industry. Hopefully the people if Pittsburgh won't fall under the same trap as people of Philadelphia do by thinking a "free" concert in exchange for a vote fir Hillary is worth it

But Hitler lost the war because many kinds of people fight against the bad guy Hitler. So vote for Clinton and Democrats. Business and country can't survive with only non Muslims whites.

She wouldn't be campaigning in Person anywhere. she wouldn't need big name celebrities to draw crowds to her events. She would be able to do that on her own, but she can't & do you know why?? She's losing & losing BIG.
19 | Todd Dorsey | 0 | 10154988659183812_10154988912833812 | For those of you who still haven't voted yet the because you haven't had a chance or because you don't know who to vote for it's pretty simple. Are you happy with the way things have gone the last eight years are you happy with our economy, our  standing in the world , with the unemployment,  the way our vets have been treated, our 20 trillion in debt, high tuition costs, giving Iran billions, giving 50% of our uranium to putin, etc. If you're happy with all those things then the choice is clear then you should vote for Hillary because you cannot blame anything on trump. He as not been in office. Hillary's hands are all over all of the decisions that have been made in the last 8 years.
20 | Catherine Marie Stout | 0 | 10154988659183812_10154988774873812 | THE STORY OF HILLARY IN A NUT SHELLA "MUST READ"To all of us, who are glued to the news, watching the election, the story unfolds as written by its author, Hillary Clinton.She just couldn’t sit still and mind her own business. After leaving the White House, she could have had a wonderful life. She and Bill could have made millions in honest and decent ways. Instead, the temptation to make hundreds of millions was too hard to resist. She started to sell her influence, probably a little at first and it grew.Eventually, the Clintons started to get some huge payments with her run against Obama with the likelihood that she would run a better campaign later. As Secretary of State, there was more influence to sell through the Clinton Foundation and through payments for speeches.She probably prompted some of the largest payments into the multimillions by telling her donors that she was going to run for the presidency. It worked. Why else would Saudi Arabia donate more than $25 Million? These donors were gambling, they played the odds, and Hillary had to play the part. She had to run for president. She would have been as good as dead if she didn’t even try.So, there she was, not knee deep, but over her head with Bill and even involving her daughter, running a criminal enterprise selling influence. She was on a path which she could no longer abandon.This middle class woman was no innocent victim. Her greed and her ego were in step with the pragmatic need to run for president. As she and Bill were experienced presidents, she knew all the tricks to get into office, and she knew all the mischief she could inflict once she became the Queen of the kingdom.She set this whole thing in motion, and just like the murderers we watch on Forensic Files, she thought that she was smart enough to get away with crimes about as serious as murder. She rationalized just as criminals do.As with other criminals, once she was used to running her influence selling organization, after a while, she thought that she would never get caught. After all, Bill had been the President of the United States, and his and her prestige put them on a platform of impenetrability.Unfortunately, for her, like most criminals, she could not anticipate every turn, every person, every nook and cranny. She probably would have gotten away with her crimes if she would have stayed as private as possible, but she just couldn’t just leave it alone. She had to go public by running for the office of the President of the United States. She had to put herself under a microscope.Now she is getting caught.She didn’t anticipate her mistakes or that someone like Donald J. Trump would come along to expose her criminality.While we are watching the election, seeing the beginning of the rise of Donald J. Trump, we are also going to see the decline of Hillary Clinton and what has literally turned into a crime family.She is desperate. Her back is against a wall. She has about half of the population and most people who matter totally involved. One problem she has, though, is that her mentality has evolved and grown. Once a person strays far from the path of decency, her criminal mentality leads to more and more actions which are off the wall. She arranged for violent protestors to attend Trump rallies. She probably arranged for false testimony from Mr. Khan and the women who claimed Donald J. Trump groped them. She had no hesitation in labeling a decent man to be a bigot and a racist. She did so well that almost half of America thinks extremely poorly about Donald J. Trump. She was getting away with all this, too.Alas she made one mistake which was the beginning of her downfall.To make sure that there would be no criminal charges against her, Hillary orchestrated the payment of more than $675,000 to one of Director Comey’s trusted agents. Due to Wikileaks, she got caught on this one.When James Comey decided to not prosecute, I had suggested that, in time, he would be ultimately seen as an American hero, the kind who used to be played by Jimmy Stewart. He is probably a decent honest man who delegated responsibilities to his trusted men and women, and who believed what they reported.No doubt, Agent McCabe’s wife received this sum which is huge for an FBI agent, and then, Agent McCabe used his influence to wiggle his way to manage the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails. It is no wonder she had such confidence that she would never be caught. She had infiltrated the FBINow, we are just past the point in the typical Forensic Files case where the police have heard allegations of unimaginable criminality from a prior president (and wife) of the United States. The police and almost half of America could not believe that someone with all that stature would become a head of a master criminal enterprise. Their imaginations just couldn’t recognize something as ridiculous to be something which is tragically true. Now, James Comey knows that she infiltrated his organization and corrupted one of his most trusted agents. Once the police know who committed the crime, or in this case that there was a crime, they get on the path to prove and prosecute their case. For so long, Director Comey was fed lies and he relied on the false information provided by Mr. McCabe.Now, we are at the point where the police are looking at Hillary’s emails like a pack of hounds. They are seeing the dark side.Now that Director Comey knows of the bribery, the bloom is off the rose. She is exposed. The police know that she is guilty. Now, they are moving at rocket speed. I am sure that Agent McCabe is no longer in charge of the investigation. Other agents, honest ones, are hitting it as fast and as thoroughly as possible.Now, it is just a matter of time. The FBI are on to her, and she is so guilty of so much, she will be exposed, hopefully before the election. After all, she wants all the evidence put “on the table.” She may get her wish.I doubt that they will be able to get things together fast enough, but there is a possibility that she will be charged and arrested before the election.Now, Hillary is able to put her mind out of reality when she performs her rally act, but there must be moments in the day when reality clicks in and she gets frightened. She must be waking up at 2:00 o’clock in the morning in a cold sweat. She knows that Mr. Comey knows. She knows that she is going to get caught. Her only hope is to become president fast enough and control the process. Mr. Comey is a true American hero who will pull the plug before that can happen. In fact, his annoucement last week may have done the trick.Donald J. Trump is right. This is worse than Watergate. This is unbelievably worse. This is an American tragedy, which even Shakespeare couldn’t have written.As lawyers say, “The truth will out.” Hillary Clinton is a criminal who has grown to a level we see only in comic books. At this point, her goose is cooked.Watch her at her rallies as she plays her part. Too bad that she has so many surrogates (some completely innocent) who speak for her. In this regard, we will see if the Obamas continue to support her. How did she get them to join her campaign? Will we find that she corrupted them, too?One way or another, this is one of the greatest stories in American history. Thankfully, we have Donald J. Trump to fix so much at this point.[If you appreciate this post, please do what you can to spread it. Share it, Tweet it. Email it. Please get this word out.]

This man has spewed his vile words and some ignore because Yes some of his ideas on how to make america great again sound great. But this man has devided our country. Those who are mentally unstable are now seeking out people on the internet that do not qualify as Americans in Trumps eyes and harassing them. I got a message from what i consider to be and mentally unstable person telling me to Go back to mexico Drug Dealer and calling me a Rapist. I am born and raised here, my mother and grandmother are citizens and just because i am mexican, i am targeted? His words to stable people mean nothing but unstable people will run with those words and terrorize in our American.

New York City is typically high on any list of possible terror targets, but this year's election brings an added need for security as Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump will have their election night parties blocks away from one another.

Are you happy with the way things have gone the last eight years are you happy with our economy, our  standing in the world , with the unemployment,  the way our vets have been treated, our 20 trillion in debt, high tuition costs, giving Iran billions, giving 50% of our uranium to putin, etc. If you're happy with all those things then the choice is clear then you should vote for Hillary because you cannot blame anything on trump.

The choice is simple; bigger government with higher taxes and Obama care costs, TPP, open borders, and government school conformity under Hillary Clinton or smaller government with lower taxes to attract more investment into building and bringing back industry to the US, interstate competition for lower-cost health care, secure borders, and school choice for all.

Hillary Clinton's campaign manager says her camp is still unclear about why the FBI director made public a probe into newly discovered emails, but that she is focused on making her final appeal to voters.

1 | Jesse Jones | 80 | 10154988449068812_10154988457948812 | Hillary is a greasy elite criminal who is above the law.  Love him of hate him, Trump would be 100x better than Crooked Hillary and the continued Obama agenda.  I mean you would have to be some kind of dumb not to see that.  It's not about feelings.... it's about America and Trump is the only answer.
2 | Suzi Reese | 41 | 10154988449068812_10154988490498812 | DRAIN THE SWAMP! Then ABC and the rest of the media lapdogs can spend 4 years speading more BS about Trump. At least, they will be doing something else besides panting at the mere mention of her name.
3 | Eddie Kostlevy | 22 | 10154988449068812_10154988483243812 | Hillary was not cleared just not charged.She lied to the public about most every aspect of the emails .She also told the FBI was it 39 times she could not recall.Criminals walk the streets of this nation because they were not charged though there was evidence they could have been and in some cases should have been.
4 | John Coppola | 8 | 10154988449068812_10154988549018812 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

Drain the Swamp is a lite word I would use. It is time for all Americans to see the truth,and stop bickering about who is better. America needs to stand united,both Blacks,Whites and Hispanics.. Trump is a better candidate,and we know who the Clintons are. Other than having the MILITARY stage a coup against a dirty government. And we know that will not happen,they have no balls to do it, even when they know what is happening, they are worried about the pensions instead of America.

17 | Tracy Andrews | 0 | 10154988449068812_10154988917978812 | SOCIALISM............There are eight levels of government control that must be obtained before you can create a social state:1. Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief of God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, was first to control the media! The news media we have today is totally being controlled to write only stories that corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, and to brainwash the American people by their 24 hour bombardment of biased news! Research these names, George Soros and Saul Alinsky, that are tied to Clinton & Obama before you go to vote!Check out Agenda 21, Agenda 30, and what Cloward-Piven means.

Janet Reno, a former Miami prosecutor who famously told reporters "I don't do spin," served nearly 8 years as attorney general under former President Bill Clinton, the longest stint in a century.

2 | Brian T Roller | 2 | 10154988300543812_10154988802178812 | Wasn't Janet Reno a leftist democrat, who was Bill Clinton's AG,  ordered the slaughter of 24 children and 46 men/women at Ruby Ridge, Waco TX ? God have mercy on her soul. Although Parkinsons is a terrible disease, it does NOT excuse her from terrible deeds.
3 | Chris Helfrich | 13 | 10154988300543812_10154988329688812 | Did she commit suicide or have a accident? I wonder if she ever felt bad about killing so many women and children in Waco? Or killing a innocent woman in Idaho? I would like to say RIP however she was one of the most evil people ever. So enjoy your time in hell.

20 | Isaac King | 0 | 10154988300543812_10154988788143812 | Hillary’s works proved well who she is:1.	Creating ISIS and funding, giving US weapons to them to kill all Christians in Syria and Iraq2.	Foreign countries’ donations for Clinton Foundation to control US politics toward those countries.3.	Bengazi crimes, deleting all record of her in that time period, because she helped to kill American Hero(s) there who did not support to create ISIS.4.	Lie after lie about deleting Govt. property, even after order from congress to protect it.5.	Putted all our national security in a place to give to our enemies like Russia, Iran, N.Korea…etc.6.	As a lawyer saved a rapist who raped a child.7.	Married a rapist (child rapist too) who never needed to go to jail.8.	Supported and funded to kill unborn babies by tax dollars. And said unborn human beings do not have any rights. She called Christians to change their faith in order to kill babies.9.	Supported Iran deal to give them permission to have atomic bombs after nine years to wipe out Israel and USA, because they call US the greatest Satan and Israel the great Satan.   10.	She refused to protect Americans, American boarders, American interests.Are not these 10 works of her enough not to cast your vote for her???

Donald J. Trump's campaign manager says she accepts that FBI Director James Comey has reaffirmed his decision not to charge Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Adrian Connor Evans | 218 | 10154988146063812_10154988150058812 | It's a sad day in America when someone runs for president, such as Hillary Clinton, and she has so many covert, deceptive activities that we have to rely on leaked information from an ousted journalist to see exactly how dishonest she is, and less than a half of the country blindly supports her
2 | Bob Jackson | 124 | 10154988146063812_10154988165408812 | Trump Supporters say:1-Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (and has cheated on his wives). Elect him. 2-Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. Put her in jail. Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem. 3-Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. 4-Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State). So savvy... Put him in the white house. 5-Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz.6-Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. 7-Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible.Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is.8-Hillary has helped pass 287 bills that support our vets. She hates vetsTrump attacks war heroes who were POWs or the families of persons who have given there lives for their country. He supports our troops and vets.9.Trump got five draft deferments to avoid serving while other brave American went and fought. He has done great service for our country-OTHER FACTS THEY DONT WANT YOU TO KNOW-Trump Casinos………..FailedTrump Mortgage…...FailedTrump University….FailedTrump Vodka………....FailedChina connection….FailedBankruptcies…………..FourIllegal alien female escort (prostitutes to you Christians),turned into a wife,1 so far (his 3rd wife)Trump clothing & deluxe hats, made in china & AsiaTrump’s daughters clothing line, made in AsiaAnd for law and order:Child rape allegations, with legal action pending3500 lawsuits against himUpcoming trail for fraudDoesn’t pay most of his small business agreements Fails to pay employee’sMob tiesRussian sympather (wouldn’t Joe McCarthy be proud)In debt to russia and chinaWhich is making America great how?So remind me again, what makes him such a “winner”?Trump Supporters Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support TRUMP and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact. Your memes are not news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform.TRUMP SHOULD NOT BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
3 | Yvonne Clerebout | 65 | 10154988146063812_10154988147888812 | I get a chuckle out of the libtards thinking that the Hildebeast will win because the FBI closed one of the two cases they have her on.

4 | Mark Thompson | 46 | 10154988146063812_10154988154563812 | ABC is biased. After the election you lost all your creditability. Along with many other news agencies. People are waking up to the rigged system.
5 | Andrew G Carter | 33 | 10154988146063812_10154988158308812 | a very sad day in America when Hillary gets away with what she has done and so many regular God fearing Americans have been arrested for it. I am astonished and heartbroken for my country and my family. #corruptionathehighestlevel
6 | Pamela Rice | 16 | 10154988146063812_10154988177988812 | I don't accept it! There is no way they went through that many emails in just a few days! I am sure the left is so thrilled that she once again has been cleared of any wrong doing because of the corruption. I have not once uttered a disrespectful comment toward anyone that supports her, but I have been called many names by her supporters!  Oh and I am even a deplorable from Hillary's own mouth! I have 2 business degrees and I am working on my third that is all tied in together. So if that is a deplorable then I guess I proudly am!
7 | Tony Gaytan | 14 | 10154988146063812_10154988232018812 | Hey Kellyanna, your leader just said yesterday that the FBI is rigged.....better be careful but he might not pay you after he is embarrassed tomorrow. Trump SUCKS

9 | Connie Martin | 4 | 10154988146063812_10154988476648812 | I am so glad this is almost over. Trump needs to go away. I'm just glad people are starting to turn away from his businesses. I know he doesn't understand consequences but seeing him get a comeuppance will be very satisfying. #ImWithHer
10 | Rebekah Smith | 6 | 10154988146063812_10154988285563812 | Good thing the Trump campaign accepts it, otherwise....what? It wouldn't count? They can accept it or not, because it changes nothing. Another example of the entire campaigns over inflated ego.
11 | Sandy Philpott | 4 | 10154988146063812_10154988550748812 | What's really sad is that there are so many people in our country who believe Hillary has the entire Justice Department in herback pocket.She has been through 10 congressional hearings and a total of 30 hearings by Republicans and Democrats and has never been found guilty of breaking the law.It has been nothing but fodder for Republican propaganda.
12 | Jan Bucher | 6 | 10154988146063812_10154988175083812 | Let's all take a day from our views,and pray that God will show up and expose all that's wrong and pray for his will to be accomplished..our views won't change corruption only divine intervention..He has shown us many things about our country and how far it's fallen to greed and power..prayer will change things..and us
13 | Howard Jackson | 3 | 10154988146063812_10154988454338812 | Her job requires to deal with American spys who put their life on the line to protect the nation. If the email are private and do not contain government secrets she broke no laws. Just like another citizens she has the right to communicate via email, has long as it is not used to break the law.
14 | Joyce Murray | 7 | 10154988146063812_10154988192613812 | With Clinton as President controlling mainstream media, who will we trust for our news? As sheep, we will follow the indoctrination we're fed...
15 | TJ Frisk | 2 | 10154988146063812_10154988527823812 | Imagine, if you will, an FBI that would keep after Trump to expose and bring charges against him for tax evasion, fraud, sexual misconduct, voter intimidation, inciting violence against political opponents, collusion with Russia and Putin with rigging of the USA elections...etc etc.It is only then will the majority of Americans ever trust the FBI again...........Vote blue for POTUS and Congress to end obstructionism, fear, hatred, racism, misogyny, bigotry and political influence of the NRA.
16 | Arnold Sandy Milne | 5 | 10154988146063812_10154988227308812 | Any politicians who try after the election to distance themselves from the Trump phenomenon — or even unendorse in these remaining few days — have already failed the character test.

18 | Roger RC Cozine II | 5 | 10154988146063812_10154988257188812 | It's sad that people want to vote for Hillary just because she is a female, or just because they don't like the things Trump said. Anyone who has checked their facts knows that Hillary would make a horrible president. Avoiding jail several times are her only political accomplishments. She has actively helped rapist get away with their crimes. Stolen from charity. Jeopardized national security. Turned her back on our American people in Bengazhi. And paid top dollar to further corrupt our legal system and FBI for her own political gain. This woman is very dangerous can can not be trusted to run our country. If she should win the presidental election, prepare to watch America get sold to the highest bidder.

24 | Brenda Barnes | 4 | 10154988146063812_10154988180783812 | The FBI knows that Trump will win this election and that is why they are waiting to charge Hillary for her crimes, knowing that if charged now that Obama would only pardon her !

As the search intensifies for Sherri Papini, the California mother of two who was reported missing after failing to return from an afternoon jog, her husband says he believes his wife was abducted.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Tami Bredeson- Chmielewski | 237 | 10154988075038812_10154988095228812 | This type of story always reminds me of Lacey Peterson😔
2 | Candi Hulsey | 76 | 10154988075038812_10154988138708812 | Clifton Bozarth all the dumbasses on here saying it was the husband are probably the same ones that blamed the pastor when his wife died in that home invasion earlier this year. I guess facebook automatically gave them the knowledge and skills to become experts and detectives.
3 | Michael Hubbard | 127 | 10154988075038812_10154988097073812 | Well yeah if I murdered my wife I'd want people to think that she was abducted too
4 | Lindsey Lesar | 54 | 10154988075038812_10154988202573812 | He would say that because he found his wife's cell phone on the side of the road and knows his wife is a good person who went MISSING while running.  It is so sad everyone is automatically blaming the husband.   I can't imagine being attacked during a run - followed by my husband and kids father being looked at so critically.  I really hope you're all wrong and I hope they focus on all leads and don't jump to conclusions.  So sad.
5 | Kelly Peers | 14 | 10154988075038812_10154988240683812 | Wow people are so judgmental. Instead of pointing fingers and assuming the husband did it, you all should be praying for the family. I hope this does not happen to any of you. Sad :(
6 | Lovely Reid | 19 | 10154988075038812_10154988154153812 | It's so scary as a woman we can go for a run alone to clear our heads and have alone time. I pray she's found alive it does happen and I pray her husband the father of her kids had nothing to do with it. Because if he's involved she's dead for sure and the kids will be left with no mom or dad. Horrible story.
7 | Hilary Cundy Huey | 7 | 10154988075038812_10154988166713812 | This guy went to a a lot of trouble to create this story. Don't guys get it yet? Wife or girlfriend goes missing the police know who to look at!!! Poor woman.
8 | Connie Williams | 6 | 10154988075038812_10154988403928812 | My question is Why would wife text husband and ask if he coming home for lunch when she know he doesn't take his personal cell phone into his work place?
9 | Mary Humphreys | 6 | 10154988075038812_10154988220083812 | My husband runs his own business. He hardly ever texts on his phone. But I still texts him knowing I probably won't get a respond for a few hours. But I do it anyways. She could have text him early bc she New he wasn't going to respond for a few hours. I do that to my husband too.
10 | Melissa Marple | 12 | 10154988075038812_10154988189478812 | I don't like it when husband's dont show emotions of any kind. Makes it a little suspicious. He was very matter of fact.
11 | Susan Thomas Horton | 2 | 10154988075038812_10154988424393812 | These people on here assuming it's the husband did you not see the interview early on where he was crying so hard he couldn't talk! It's not nice to assume. The detectives and other agencies are working on the case! I hope she is found alive, and unharmed! Please don't place blame on anyone! They have more evidence that he did NOT do it then if he did! Prayers for the family! Place yourself in their shoes, how would you feel, the pain and agony of just waiting for her to be found! Very sad situations! Pray people!
12 | Mayra Figueroa | 1 | 10154988075038812_10154988419683812 | If she went jogging around 2, why didn't she respond to his text at 139 pm?  Or did she?  The husband appears too calm in the interview. If my husband was missing, just talking about it would get me emotional or teary eyed. Something. Too strange
13 | Sonja Rutledge | 2 | 10154988075038812_10154988169428812 | There were two other women who disappeared while jogging within the past couple of months. I don't recall what state and believe one was found deceased.
14 | Ashley Zamzow | 0 | 10154988075038812_10154988606198812 | Maybe she broke down and did leave you never know what feelings people hide......the husband doesn't really sound suspicious to me you would think he would automatically pick up the kids and come up with a reason why he is getting them instead of her.
15 | AliMarie Diaz | 2 | 10154988075038812_10154988557303812 | I have a tendency to run in the trails that lead in the middle of nowhere. I also plug both earphones in to be surrounded by music. I should really stop being stupid and not do that because anything can happen. I always tell my husband what I'm doing and where I'm at but pretty scary anybody can just snatch you up. I pray this woman is found.

In the new trove of emails, the FBI found thousands of potentially relevant messages, including messages sent to and from Hillary Clinton herself while she was secretary of state. But the FBI found most of those emails to be personal messages or ones they had already seen.

8 | Nicole Marie | 33 | 10154987900268812_10154987964423812 | Let's face it she got away with it! Unfortunately our system has failed us because if this was anyone else they would be strung up like at cat!!! Money talks and BS walks.. If these emails weren't important or incriminating then Why did she delete them? And 33,000 of them common.. This women should be in prison if she is president material she would damn to be held accountable as my mom always says Set By Example!!!!
9 | Alison Swain | 22 | 10154987900268812_10154988045433812 | Thanks to Wikileaks, now we know why Hillary deleted the "personal" emails related to Chelsea's wedding: it was paid for using Clinton Foundation charity funds. Illegal.

19 | Sherrill Winchester | 0 | 10154987900268812_600606510132183 | Trump seems to forget that the FBI had this laptop weeks, meaning multiple, when the FBI found the cache of emails. Meaning, most of Weiners email might have been reviewed already. Take that information along with the high technology used to go through the Clinton emails, after a warrant WAS issued to look at the ones between Huma and Clinton. Then again he does either forget to the point of denying things he's said that are on tape.Then let's look at fact checks, lies 75 % of the timeSo obvious that the 8 days he keeps yapping about,Is so not true. Then again, he has to play to his base.
20 | Jill Halvax | 4 | 10154987900268812_10154987934508812 | Careless and negligent but she didn't know better. I wonder if that excuse will work for everyone or only those who can buy their way out.
21 | Judy McGaw Coburn | 5 | 10154987900268812_10154988052988812 | This email probe should NEVER have been made public so close to election Tuesday without FIRST confirming that they were of significance! The fact that Comey chose to do so clearly shows his partisan favoritism. Without a doubt, he KNEW his decision would influence the election. Clearing these emails one day before the election is his attempt to save his job, since it is pretty clear that Clinton will win. I have lost all respect for this man and hope retribution will be swift for him when HRC is in the Oval Office.
22 | Misty Daniels | 3 | 10154987900268812_10154988024458812 | Y'all need to quit with this stuff,let's investigate Comey and see who paid him to do that and let's investigate Trump for all his business deals in Russia and lay everything on the table he seems to want to call everyone out on there stuff but both candidates should bring all of there stuff to the table and see who's hiding more and who's corrupt

3 | Mike Palmer | 20 | 10154987704803812_10154987714803812 | Because of the media like ABC News causing a lot of confusion and of course tons of hate on both Dem's and Republicans. The media should feel ashamed of themselves. I am completely burned out of this election crap.

6 | Jason Brine | 5 | 10154987704803812_10154987725983812 | How indeed. How have we allowed such corruption to go unchecked. And I'm not even referring to Clinton or Trump in this case but at how major parties have run their businesses for the past forever. Party financing is at the root of this. There is too much money in politics and money will corrupt, it's not even a question of "if". Remember what politics is supposed to be about, take money out of it.

15 | Azemina Med Suv | 2 | 10154987704803812_10154987749233812 | PASS THIS AROUND IT GIVES HEART FELT INSIGHT.Will A Kelly WROTE : Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months, I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process, you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr. Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!MR. TRUMP
16 | Doris Ann Stewart | 1 | 10154987704803812_10154987904783812 | It may come to a close, but if some the people vote for Hillary Clinton . The corruption that she is doing will not stop unless we the people stop her. The worst thing that gets me it the Sex with 12 year old kids. She is pure evil then told about trump. Again if you vote for her you are going along with it . I fil sorry for you if you do
17 | Gina Williams-Vacala | 4 | 10154987704803812_10154987711228812 | Does any of this scare you?There are eight levels of control that must be obtained before you can create a social state:1. Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"! Wake up and Vote for Trump, he is our only hope to rid our country of the stinking rotten corruption!If you don't know who George Soros is. Who Saul Alinsky was. What Agenda 21 or Agenda 30 is, and what Cloward-Piven means... educate yourself. Research these names tied with Clinton & Obama before you go to vote!!

This has to be by far the nastiest most dirty, cheap, unprofessional political campaign ever! There's no turning back, subliminal racism, bigotry, hatred, prejudice are now the normalcy. Civility has been lost! When we disagree with one another now it's name calling, insults and tantrum! This election will be known as the election of scandals (both sides are guilty) investigations, solicitation of spying on an opponent, sexual assault scandal, email scandals etc.. There's no winner tomorrow, we as a nation all lose regardless of who get the coveted 270 magic number. We're as divided as we can be this time around! Not that I'm wishing it but not even another 9/11 can bring us back together after this tsunami of garbage. Both political parties gave us the worst they had to offer starting with the primaries ending with November 8, choices. This election we really have much to be proud about! We can all simply say "I voted".
24 | David Sammy Jr. | 2 | 10154987704803812_10154987712813812 | It all started based on lies and innuendos, we watch as Trump tries to pull of the biggest political con job that were ever perpetrated on the citizens of America.

They sound like they are on the brink of insanity...hee, hee, hee sorry I can't help myself... Please vote for Hillary I want so badly to see these old guys freak out when they have a woman president. <3

NEW: Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump  end the 2016 campaign with the race between them close, their historic unpopularity intact, latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll finds—and, on the bright side, a weary electorate saying it's ready to accept the outcome and move on.

1 | Susan Kirkpatrick | 602 | 10154987649043812_10154987670563812 | So many great women would be a better president but we end up with trash? Not saying trump is the better choice but Hillary shouldn't even be in the running.
2 | David Sammy Jr. | 170 | 10154987649043812_10154987667053812 | I'm fed up of Trump and his distractions,his fear mongering his lies and innuendos I can't wait for election day when Trump will be deleted like junk files on my smartphone..
3 | Deborah Halaby | 109 | 10154987649043812_10154987675018812 | Bull crap polling they just showed a video showing how someone was at a polling station handing out tickets to see LeBron James at Hillary rally after they vote to persuade people to vote for her....disqusting and clearly illiegal 😡
4 | Mike Ryals | 125 | 10154987649043812_10154987659403812 | These events have been orchestrated in favor of Hillary Clinton; making her appear, like she's being politically persecuted by the government, and then being redeemed as if she was innocent all the long. If you have a brain, you wouldn't buy this deception. The truth is, Trump threatens the status quo, and they will do whatever it takes to stop him; we must do whatever it takes to prevent them. #vote
5 | Michael Perry | 77 | 10154987649043812_10154987675598812 | Tomorrow is Election Day 2016! Think before you vote people! We had an extremely disastrous and chaotic administration for the past 8 years with one minority President. We sure can't afford an even bigger failure (if possible) with another minority! Vote Trump and eliminate the democratic failures of the past 8 years and counting if you vote for Hillary and the democratic devils! #KeepItTraditional
6 | Lynne Oosterman | 62 | 10154987649043812_10154987679358812 | Very strange (or not) how in the GMA broadcast a couple of minutes ago you found it necessary to overlook the lewd, disgusting language of JayZee this weekend at a Hillary event, yet you needed to point out one action by Ted Nugent. And you wonder why many feel the system is rigged. Or you don't wonder, because you are a willing participant.
7 | Greg Collins | 48 | 10154987649043812_10154987719708812 | TRUMP is not a Republican, TRUMP is not a Democrat anymore, TRUMP is not a Politician, TRUMP is an American,  he is our first chance in a long time to not be controlled by special interest, and probably our last.

Are NOT voting for a Democrat or a republican! We (millionssssss of us!) are voting for the ONLY candidate who had the balls to stand before the American people and say---"I will put America and Americans,,,,1st"!!----THAT,,,is who we are supporting! :)

Vote to DRAIN the DC establishment swamp of corruption!!Vote for Donald Trump!!Trump will make it MUCH easier for companies to do business in America by reducing our DISGUSTING corporate tax rate, and CRAZY HIGH marginal rates on higher earners. He also promised to start getting rid of NUISANCE regulations that KILL incentive and drive companies overseas.If you make it EASIER to do business in America you get MORE of it, creating more JOBS!!Thanks to Wikileaks and other sources, we know for a FACT that Hillary has already promised her Wall Street buddies that she will get the horrible TPP done. REMEMBER....she says one things to her low information voters, and ANOTHER THING to her paymasters on Wall Street!Vote for JOBS, vote to drain the DC swamp, vote for Donald Trump!!
13 | Nicholas Matregrano | 8 | 10154987649043812_10154987728098812 | I cannot wait until election day is behind us. The Political Ads have been sickening. Why can't they tell us the good they will do for our country, not how screwed up their opponent is.
14 | Azemina Med Suv | 7 | 10154987649043812_10154987691618812 | PASS THIS AROUND IT GIVES HEART FELT INSIGHT.Will A Kelly WROTE : Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months, I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process, you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr. Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!MR. TRUMP
15 | Mike Terranova | 5 | 10154987649043812_10154987692258812 | My vote is not a vote against Clinton. My vote is not a vote against Trump. My vote is not a vote in protest. No political party automatically acquires my vote. The media with their constant coverage and barrage of sound bites certainly does not get to decide for me. A candidate alone has to earn my vote. Given a binary choice between Trump and Clinton, I would abstain. My vote for GARY JOHNSON is not extracting my vote from anyone. My vote is for fiscal responsibility. My vote is for much needed tax and entitlement reform. My vote is for congressional term limits. My vote is for ending crony capitalism. My vote is pragmatic immigration reform. My vote is a vote for an impenetrable national DEFENSE not a force that engages in regime change. My vote is for a small and nimble government not a bloated overbearing one. My vote is for a WASHINGTON OUTSIDER, extremely successful businessman, and successful and popular governor. #johnsonweld2016.

18 | Imelda Sunshine | 6 | 10154987649043812_10154987712073812 | Is this based on early voting results? I thought they are not supposed to count until election day! If its just poll, then why I would believe it? Anybody can made up poll results and we dont know where the source from.

I've always favored this network over the rest, looks like it's time to move it along somewhere else. For the love of Pete just once it would be so refreshing to have the media actually tell us the truth instead of the adapted version you decided to give us. I'm totally fed up with media broadcasting and you are a bunch of prolific liars! Shame on you ABC News😡😡...
20 | Guiseppe Mario Mazzola | 8 | 10154987649043812_10154987802498812 | its sad that people are going to go out and vote for Hillary clinton .I mean if u really just wanted to kill yourself you all were better off jumping off a bridge not vote in a criminal.Dont bring down the country with your vote.
21 | Gina Williams-Vacala | 9 | 10154987649043812_10154987699003812 | Does any of this scare you?There are eight levels of control that must be obtained before you can create a social state:1. Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"! Wake up and Vote for Trump, he is our only hope to rid our country of the stinking rotten corruption!If you don't know who George Soros is. Who Saul Alinsky was. What Agenda 21 or Agenda 30 is, and what Cloward-Piven means... educate yourself. Research these names tied with Clinton & Obama before you go to vote!!
22 | Jeff Peadro | 0 | 10154987649043812_1278233795549521 | Poll size 1,900. The poll sizes the main stream media project are a joke."This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Nov. 2-5, 2016, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,937 likely voters. Results have a margin of sampling error of 2.5 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 38-31-27 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents.Q7, Q10 and Q11 were asked Nov. 3-5 among 1,773 likely voters; those results also have a 2.5-point error margin."

25 | John Garza | 1 | 10154987649043812_1278248622214705 | Those Repubs in Red States that plan to vote on Tuesday, join the GOP notables and millions of Republicans that chose to put country before party and voted for Clinton. She's the obvious choice to lead our country compared to Trump, a proven liar, racist, con man, fraud, sexual predator, and tax evader. Be the heroes to put Hillary Clinton in the White House!

My neighbors are both young scientists and married as a result of that shared love. Who is anyone to judge why they're getting married?But I don't think engagement photos are national newsworthy.

8 | Ravi Shankar | 1 | 10154987574073812_10154987722083812 | I love America. I grew up watching Star Man, Lucan, Remington Steele, Newhart, Knight Rider, Miami Vice, Together We Stand, Family Ties, Sesame Street, Magnum, Matt Houston and later The Early Edition, The Pretender, John Doe and many many more. It has the highest acreage after USSR. I have not taken any side of either Hillary or Trump. Both do not have the age or qualification. It had bad leaders who dropped two atom bombs just to test on the Japanese the impact on health and devastation. It always had a good Hollywood and bad Capitol Hill. America is going to have a debt of 20-22 trillion dollars and would not be able to service the debt of the Arab world and China. This is a time to turn to religion and vote for the best candidate. The future of America after bombing over 60 countries is bad and even prophecies hint in 2037 onwards that the land will be degraded and the people stripped of their moral values and China and Russia will drop nuclear missiles on USA and teach it a lesson. The only way to reverse this bad tide is to turn to religion. Gerald Celente predicted devaluation of the dollar by 90%, hyperinflation and food riots. Return to vegetarian food like the Christ who ate bread and water.Return to Jesus Christ who had bread and water. Or return to vegetarian food. Animals which are killed in captivity and thus due to fear toxins are released and these are carcinogens which cause cancer, Parkinson's disease and other neuro ailments. Practice Transcendental Meditation or any meditation technique and yoga and watch healthcare costs spiral downwards.

High school senior from Virginia – who has learning disabilities caused by Fragile X syndrome  –  led his team onto the gridiron Friday night, finally getting his chance to take the field.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Rachel Lintz Martinez | 63 | 10154987474678812_10154987623053812 | I hate when they "let a teammate play" the last game of the season. Its quite condesending. Seasons over, see how much fun we've been having. Show me a story where a kid with disabilities plays in every game that's inclusion. This is just a a load of nonsense.
2 | Sheree VanCleave | 5 | 10154987474678812_10154987724563812 | My brother and 3 of my 4 sons have Fragile X Syndrome. Fragile X is totally separate from Autism. It's a genetic mutation in which they can have any or ALL features of autism also. My boys have severe developmental and intellectual delays. 2 have ADHD and sleep disorders. They all have every autistic feature in severity.
3 | Judy Flagg Peterson | 1 | 10154987474678812_10154988531968812 | What really matters here is that this young man got to play and win for his team. Don't confuse what's being said with what you want it to say. I work with fragile X children and you cannot understand what it is till you see it in real life. Never diminish any accomplishment these children get to achieve because for them this is the most momentous time in their life. They are not a label, they are amazing and doing the best they can with who they are. Be happy for this young man no matter how you feel.
4 | Alicia Perkins Moran | 17 | 10154987474678812_10154987609938812 | Autism and Fragile X are TWO TOTALLY different things!!! Fragile X is a genetic mutation!   Get your facts straight
5 | Leah Murphy-Pfister | 11 | 10154987474678812_10154987725773812 | If they truley supported him he would have played more than the last game. So in other words they didn't let him play in any other games but when in last game they decide to LET HIM PLAY !  And people are supposed to cheer them for this ?????
6 | Sharon Detention Vamp Bourn | 1 | 10154987474678812_10154988010623812 | A form of autism called fragile x syndrome   Fragile X Syndrome is not autism it can autism but they are two separate conditions not everyone with autism has fragile x syndrome or vice versa !!

8 | Laura Hill | 1 | 10154987474678812_10154987716983812 | Don't limit children and adults with disabilities. You can learn a whole new way of doing things and see the world from thier eyes. I don't my son is autistic. I don't treat him like he can to anything. He can and he is very smart. My sweet son is the very loving and has a great attitude. Everyone who meets him tells him he is doing great.

10 | Darcey Dwyer | 0 | 10154987474678812_10154987897828812 | Fragile X is NOT autism. Never had been and never will be.

16 | Ravi Shankar | 0 | 10154987474678812_10154987546013812 | I love America. I grew up watching Star Man, Lucan, Remington Steele, Newhart, Knight Rider, Miami Vice, Together We Stand, Family Ties, Sesame Street, Magnum, Matt Houston and later The Early Edition, The Pretender, John Doe and many many more. It has the highest acreage after USSR. I have not taken any side of either Hillary or Trump. Both do not have the age or qualification. It had bad leaders who dropped two atom bombs just to test on the Japanese the impact on health and devastation. It always had a good Hollywood and bad Capitol Hill. America is going to have a debt of 20-22 trillion dollars and would not be able to service the debt of the Arab world and China. This is a time to turn to religion and vote for the best candidate. The future of America after bombing over 60 countries is bad and even prophecies hint in 2037 onwards that the land will be degraded and the people stripped of their moral values and China and Russia will drop nuclear missiles on USA and teach it a lesson. The only way to reverse this bad tide is to turn to religion. Gerald Celente predicted devaluation of the dollar by 90%, hyperinflation and food riots. Return to vegetarian food like the Christ who ate bread and water.

NEW: Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as U.S. attorney general and the epicenter of several political storms during the Clinton administration, dies at 78, AP reports.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ruben Vega | 171 | 10154987474003812_10154987477488812 | I wonder if the first thing she saw was those 25 children from waco massacre??
2 | Judith Jobes Willett | 123 | 10154987474003812_10154987531863812 | Some people are sick. If you didn't like her, just don't post anything. No matter whether she was right or wrong in how she handled things, she is a human being and these nasty comments are just not necessary. RIP Janet Reno.
3 | Christopher Scott | 101 | 10154987474003812_10154987500138812 | Word is she voted for trump during early voting. This didn't sit well with Hillary.
4 | Danny Partin | 67 | 10154987474003812_10154987510538812 | Question. If you are voting for Clinton. How do you justify the fact that she DID break the law and put national security at risk? How do you justify her campaign caught on video saying they paid people to cause violence at Trump rallies? How do you justify her and her husbands connection to Epsteins Island where CHILDREN are used for sex? How do you justify her pay for play scandal with Clinton Foundation, which by the way is still under investigation? How do you justify her open border policy, have you bothered to see what has happened to Europe? How do you justify another 4 years of next to zero growth, mored spending and trust me all our taxes will go up. I dont get it.
5 | Ivan Daniel Beller | 36 | 10154987474003812_10154987512563812 | Today Janet Reno is reunited with all the women and children she rescued in Waco, Texas!And tomorrow, her old boss's wife, Hillary Clinton, will be given the green-light to rescue all the women and children in Syria!Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves!
6 | Enrique Torres | 26 | 10154987474003812_10154987613223812 | She's not owed any respect, alive or dead, so stop trying to guilt people into giving condolences or not wishing that she ROT IN HELL. Everyone has the right to wish pain on this sorry tramps whole family in this loss due to all the families she hurt too. It's called freedom to express, it doesn't always go your way ;)
7 | Kevin McCabe | 31 | 10154987474003812_10154987560918812 | After Waco, Reno figured into some of the controversies and scandals that marked the Clinton administration, including Whitewater, Filegate, bungling at the FBI laboratory, Monica Lewinsky, alleged Chinese nuclear spying and questionable campaign financing in the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election. ...... I didn't say this. ABC News did.It just makes Hillary sound like a suspect.
8 | Alison Swain | 21 | 10154987474003812_10154987509368812 | She's always been crooked, even in her Miami prosecutor days. Refused to prosecute Dems who had been caught with boxes full of ballots found in a warehouse.
9 | Judy Hettinger | 27 | 10154987474003812_10154987560998812 | Wow..sitting here reading all these negative evil comments..and some people have the nerve to talk about how evil Trump and Hillary are....the human race is totally disgusting and sick!
10 | Michael Moretti | 6 | 10154987474003812_10154987591948812 | If there is GodI hope it doesn't take her to peace I hope her and her Family  never find peace in this or Adder life Waco Texas still hurts what she did to children and FBI Rest In Hell Janet Reno
11 | Nikki Garvin | 5 | 10154987474003812_10154987477443812 | May she rest in peace. I will always remember her from that Elian Gonzales situation. I was too young to know about her tenure in the Clinton Admin. I mean in more detail.
12 | Elena Schlossberg-Kunkel | 33 | 10154987474003812_10154987510603812 | Some articles should simply not allow comments. I wish peace to her family.
13 | Melissa A Lucio | 15 | 10154987474003812_10154987574963812 | I met her and spoke with her on several occasions. She was very nice and really seemed to care about our challenging duties. She came and sat through Susan Rodriguez's funeral. I remember breaking down crying and Reno crossing the aisle to come give me a big hug to comfort me. I recall her riding horses out in Santa Teresa in jeans and tennis shoes. I recall talking to her at a WIFLE conference and how she didn't mind posing for a picture with me and my favorite author, Patricia Cornwell (I wish that Walgreen's hadn't ruined my film later). Anyhow, she seemed very approachable and down-to-earth. She was a strapping woman with a soft side to her. May she Rest In Peace.
14 | Jan Kirtley Lee | 2 | 10154987474003812_10154988063253812 | I love the saying, and I paraphrase: when you die God isn't going to ask you about anyone else's sins, just your own. It might be well for all of you people judging her to be mindful of that.
15 | Adriana Margarita | 6 | 10154987474003812_10154987607143812 | we had lost respect for human, this ugly message, really this is the reason why we are living like this. rest in peace, and lord please give us wisdom to be better everyday.
16 | Diana Hernandez | 269 | 10154987474003812_10154987505643812 | Shame on you those who are making those disgusting comments. Someone love one has died. Who are to say she's going to hell. Instead be wary of your own soul. RIP Janet Reno. I actually did meet you. And it was a honor. I pray for peace for your friends and family.
17 | Mikey Gwaz | 17 | 10154987474003812_10154987527523812 | He was an honorable man. Even though he messed up Waco he deserves our respect. RIP Mr. Reno.
18 | Maureen Mould | 6 | 10154987474003812_10154987674773812 | Our country is becoming an embarrassment, as has been said, if you don't care for the woman, don't post, she has passed at least have respect for her family and her in death, shame on you all for your nasty comments!! RIP Janet, prayers too you and your family
19 | Andrea Shields | 0 | 10154987474003812_10154988875728812 | ENOUGH!!!!! give it a rest...and stop posting ignorant comments about Hillary Clinton's e-mails....this is not the proper place and seriously no one gives a sh** anymore including the F ing FBI director who's career is over no matter which candidate wins tomorrow.
20 | Lloyd Hart | 1 | 10154987474003812_10154987890153812 | Janet Reno is the person most responsible for all the death and destruction the US has inflicted on the world in the last 16 years with it's phony "War On Terror". As US Attorney General, she didn't lift a finger to investigate the theft of election 2000 and the subsequent suborning of the US Supreme Court by the Bush Campaign because the Clintons bribed and blackmailed her off the case. Janet Reno, coward to the grave.

While employed for an entire country, HRC ALONE, current debacle our country has been mired in, made a decision to put us all at risk and did not use her employer's server. Ramifications of which, her employer, 330+ million of us, may pay the price for. But her opponent, BETTER NOT DO..only HRC gets a pass on that, aye..!! We are a nation of laws"... and huge sigh..FBI concluded the same, AND AMERICANS, THAT IS A GOOD THING? HRC ..the "HIGH" for America she promises us. Anyone got kids? what are you telling them about cheating? What does it say for our country. Where do we go from here?  Any predictions what FBI will conclude about the  Clinton Foundation now?

9 | Mark Corney | 0 | 10154987366653812_10154988537233812 | “Because neither Hillary nor her aides are currently State employees, it is at least somewhat unusual to reopen an investigation,” former U.N. ambassador John Bolton told me. “If they were still employed, disciplinary action could include cancelling their security clearances, lowering their GS ["General Services" or government pay]-grade, or even being fired. None of those are now possible, except for revoking security clearances if they still have them, and flagging their personnel records so that State and/or other agencies don’t hire them in the future.”Facebook keeps booting me for posting the link.

Massive voter fraud occurring across the country under the last names of Garcia, Rodriguez, Rameriz, and Gonzalez. All HAARP programming which are shooting,  accidents, robberies, rapes, etc use the local cell towers done by the local paid HAARP college staff whose Presidents need to put these obvious employees on lockdown on election day.Note today's HAARP medical murder of former Clinton's US Attorney General Janet Reno to pass a huge coded message.Comey is not even willing to fight for his obvious 6th newborn child that was killed medically by the HAARP system under the Bill Clinton adminstration. What is wrong with Comey's wife. She obviously does not know how to get him to do what is right no matter what. No wonder it was reported that a lot of FBI wanted to resign but for their personal safety knowing too much about Hillary's crimes they have to work for "P" Comey. HAARP responsible for all military suicides!

Pregnant Colorado woman whose plan was to give birth on Election Day rushed to the polling station to vote before heading to the hospital when she unexpectedly went into labor over the weekend.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sean Gallagher | 165 | 10154987281583812_10154987287773812 | That's a strong determined woman. Reminds me of someone running for president.
2 | Adrian De Loza | 226 | 10154987281583812_10154987302033812 | Thank you Donald Trump for inspiring young mothers to delay pregnancy just to get in a vote AGAINST YOU.
3 | Kris Piel | 37 | 10154987281583812_10154987625888812 | This article is incredibly stupid! A pregnant woman voted..... OK.... And???? She didn't have to go while in labor. She obviously knew who she was voting for so she could have gone sooner. This is obviously a publicity stunt for herself.
4 | Barack Guillain | 24 | 10154987281583812_10154987674118812 | The increased voter turnout this year is due to the fact that most of Americans want to keep Trump out of the oval office. Thank you Trump for motivating Americans to go to vote Against You
5 | Denisse Garcia | 4 | 10154987281583812_10154988086573812 | Deplorables' comments are getting more disgusting by the minute. Not only by their foul mouths, but also by their lack of research and critical thinking behind their thoughts. They're bullies with zero intelligence just like their leader
6 | Iris Green | 0 | 10154987281583812_10154988695783812 | That's what you heard about Hillary take on abortion? First off who goes full term with a baby and aborts the baby without it being life or death reasons or stillborn. If someone chooses to have a baby that has extreme medical issues, disabilities and nk quality of life. You republicans wouldn't help her with medical, assisted living, care giving, etc. But want to have something to say? Get out of here.
7 | Adrian Gonzalez | 4 | 10154987281583812_10154988130333812 | She voted for Killiry. Did she abort the baby right after 💀👶🏻. That a sad world we're going to live in. If that she witch is elected.
8 | Donna Lynn Foulds | 11 | 10154987281583812_10154987472368812 | Why do we care about this? Why is this in the news? Who decides these things?
9 | Gina Williams-Vacala | 4 | 10154987281583812_10154987738093812 | Does any of this scare you?There are eight levels of control that must be obtained before you can create a social state:1. Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"! Wake up and Vote for Trump, he is our only hope to rid our country of the stinking rotten corruption!If you don't know who George Soros is. Who Saul Alinsky was. What Agenda 21 or Agenda 30 is, and what Cloward-Piven means... educate yourself. Research these names tied with Clinton & Obama before you go to vote!!
10 | Jack Morris | 1 | 10154987281583812_10154988583273812 | Ten reasons to vote Democrat #10. I vote Democrat because I love the fact that I can now marry whatever I want. I've decided to marry my German Shepherd.#9. I vote Democrat because I believe oil companies' profits of 4% on a gallon of gas are obscene, but the government taxing the same gallon at 15% isn't.#8. I vote Democrat because I believe the government will do a better job of spending the money I earn than I would.#7. I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is fine as long as nobody is offended by it.#6. I vote Democrat because I'm way too irresponsible to own a gun, and I know that my local police are all I need to protect me from murderers and thieves. I am also thankful that we have a 911 service that gets police to your home in order to identify your body after a home invasion. It will take the police an average of about 15 minutes to get to your house; 00 buckshot travels at about 1200 ft/sec.#5. I vote Democrat because I'm not concerned about millions of babies being aborted so long as we keep all death row inmates alive and comfy.#4. I vote Democrat because I think illegal aliens have a right to free health care, education, and Social Security benefits, and we should take away Social Security from those who paid into it.#3. I vote Democrat because I believe that businesses should not be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to break even and give the rest away to the government for redistribution as the Democrat Party sees fit.#2. I vote Democrat because I believe liberal judges need to rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit fringe kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters.And, the #1 reason I vote Democrat is because I think it's better to pay $billions$ for oil to people who hate us, but not drill our own because it might upset some endangered beetle, gopher, or fish here in America. We don't care about the beetles, gophers, or fish in those other countries

1 | Erin Marie Yager | 11 | 10154987172988812_10154987268803812 | I'm all about live and let live. But this is getting crazy! For example, I have a friend who gets about $800 a month in social security. Her spouse can't work at this time, and his monthly insurance premium is jumping from @ $230 per month to about $750 per month. If she didn't take on a part time job, that would leave them with less than $50 a month to live on. So while the wealthy celebrities are stumping for Clinton, and the people on subsidized health care are voting for Clinton, the people who have worked all of their lives, and those of us in the middle class are getting screwed. I've seen people's names changed because they bought a new social security card illegally, I've been to the richest cities in the country with people sleeping on the sidewalks, I've been called racist because I don't agree with this administration, I've seen towers fall, and I've seen my hometown county turn into the 2nd most affected by meth and heroin in NY state, (of which Clinton was a Senator). I've watched videos of Clinton saying she was against gay marriage, that she was for a border wall, called young black men "super predators" and her outright lies about a little place called Benghazi. As I've said before, I don't know if Trump is the answer, but this woman, with all of the opportunity she has had to affect change, is definitely not the answer. She walked into Washington 40 plus years ago with the sole purpose to gain the Presidency. It's been about her the entire time. Kicked off the Watergate case for taking home documents, lying under oath, and the most recent admission of accepting an unreported gift of 1 million dollars from a foreign nation (that which you need to report). They left Haiti, still in ruins. This woman can't even wear an American flag pin, as to not offend her foreign counterparts. This is not the America my ancestors came here for. Scared to speak your mind, less control over your children's upbringing, and a new database with your private healthcare information going straight to the government. All true. All evidence based in fact. When Tuesday is over, one way or another it's gonna be scary. I just hope. I don't know what I hope. But I'm gonna have a back up plan. GN, and stay safe.
2 | Anthony G. Argomaniz | 2 | 10154987172988812_10154987693253812 | If any system is rigid its california's, voting to exclude themselves from laws, The California State Senate agrees with Charlie Rangel that they “deserve” to own guns but the citizens do not!They voted 28-8 to exempt themselves from the gun-control laws that apply to the rest of the California.You think maybe this will cause Californians to rise up? NOPE! It happened 5 years ago and since California has passed a plethora of other gun laws…that only apply to citizens.
3 | Danny Partin | 9 | 10154987172988812_10154987511038812 | Question. If you are voting for Clinton. How do you justify the fact that she DID break the law and put national security at risk? How do you justify her campaign caught on video saying they paid people to cause violence at Trump rallies? How do you justify her and her husbands connection to Epsteins Island where CHILDREN are used for sex? How do you justify her pay for play scandal with Clinton Foundation, which by the way is still under investigation? How do you justify her open border policy, have you bothered to see what has happened to Europe? How do you justify another 4 years of next to zero growth, mored spending and trust me all our taxes will go up. I dont get it.

Everyday our KIDS, FAMILY, FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS, CO-WORKERS, etc. are dying!!! Heroin is in just about all our High Schools, and Middle Schools! Trump brought this up at the debates and at his rallies, Hil-liar-y has ignored it and so has Obama over the last 8 years and allowed it to become a epidemic! Everyone who reads this probably has a loved one who is addicted to Heroin or knows someone who is!!! Think about this before you vote! Remember Obama just released hundreds of Drugs lords from Federal Prisons early!!!

Seriously you gave Obama a chance and what has he done for We The American People in the past 8 YEARS??? Oh wait he gave us Obama Health Care that not one of us can afford! My Status May Not Matter To You, But It matters to me! Our Country is on the line! You have this One and Only Chance in a lifetime to Vote for someone who Truly Cares about We The American People, Someone who Truly Loves this country! Please do your research on Facts before casting your vote, As Our Country Is On The Line!!!

The great societies first sign of collapse was when women started putting themselves ahead of their children.2. THE PRESS; The CORRUPTION. The checks and balances of a free press are gone. America is in decline.3. THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY; "Stand Down On Mortgage Fraud" Obummer has hit a new low campaigning to stay out of prison.4. SENATOR SANDERS (my candidate); Folded like a cheap suit!5. THE DUMBED DOWN AMERICAN; Stupid people blinded by non issues.6. THE FBI & DOJ; The STENCH of corruption permeates our America from sea to sea.7. THE STAR STRUCK; Who follow BOBBLEHEADS (Jay Z; Beyonce, LaBron, Springsteen) like sheep instead of the real issues.Trump, who doesn't need the job to stay out of jail, is no prize. Any "reasoning out" (this involves higher "decipherin" for the Jethros and Ellie Mays) of the the two there is no voting for a confirmed lying scamming criminal who is above the laws that send the same idiots to jail that are voting for the Crook.

This is one reason why Americans are seen as hypocrites, we preach democracy while we make back room deals with anyone to benefit our pockets!! We as Americans have a choice tomorrow... Many do not approve of Trump's past behaviour but is that enough to over look the complete corruption that has occurred in this country? I say the American people should deliver the verdict of guilt upon this government that works for US and not themselves!! We need to stop the scandals and phoniness of the establishment that keeps lying and deceiving with every bill passed and every electoral vote... Enough is enough!!! No more Clintons, Reids, McCains.. no more of the old. We need to elect Trump, be it as it may good or bad but judgement day is upon us and the American people need to once and for all be heard!!! #neverhillary.

I thought democracy was the freedom to vote/support who you wanted for and those who did not agree but have to respect.I thought both sides have had enough with bad economic growth, unemployment, health care, etc. But yet attack each other when you should unite and say -Hey! Is this really the best candidate's both parties can give us?-You blame Hillary, you blame Trump.... but they are a perfect representation of the people and what they want (NOT Need).... both candidates act accordingly their supporters, I mean just pay attention. Is this what will "Make America Great Again"?Is this why "When they go low You make sure you call them ignorant"?It really doesn't matter who is elected....Look at you!!, Look at this election!!!Both candidates should not be candidates, both have facts proving they get wealthy by tricking the medium class....It's very simple how society (anywhere) worksHigh class (the 1%) - they make choices of your lifeMedium-High class - they work exclusively for that 1% to promote, persuade and sell you the choice made for youMedium  Class - they are the people who work to keep the wheels spinning Low Class - these are the people the 1% use to provoque votes, fear, example, etc.

4 | John Johanson | 7 | 10154987080993812_10154987695358812 | It's chilling that a ruthless killer like Putin is hand picking our next president. Or doing his damnedest . I don't like it at all. And frankly as a blue collar grass janitor I'd tear trump a new one in a battle of wits. Against Putin he would be unarmed. Very very scary.
5 | Kay Johnson | 1 | 10154987080993812_10154988572293812 | There is nothing praise worthy about Putin. The murder of those that oppose him is routine under his reign. He is a Russian dictator and I hope we elect a President tomorrow who will stand up to him and not allow his tyranny to spread.

8 of 9 children hospitalized in Washington state for polio-like illness have rare syndrome that causes varying degrees of limb weakness, health officials confirm.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Leann Smith Strickland | 44 | 10154986954613812_10154987194103812 | For those that can't manage to read the article.....Many viruses and germs are linked to it, including germs that can cause colds, sore throats and respiratory infections. It can also be caused by poliovirus and non-polio enteroviruses, mosquito-borne viruses such as West Nile virus or Zika virus, and autoimmune conditions. The best way to prevent AFM is to keep general illnesses at bay through hand-washing and vaccinating children against the flu.
2 | Sharon Smith | 66 | 10154986954613812_10154987013068812 | Still got parents out there that doesn't think it wise to get their children vaccinated. And then wonder why their child got sick dummies 🙄🙄
3 | Tara Griffin | 6 | 10154986954613812_10154987165043812 | Well you can move to Iraq Lisa!! They have so much respect for Women there😂see what happens when you are an illegal immigrant there. You'd be begging for the Deplorables to help you
4 | Sydney Love Richburg | 10 | 10154986954613812_10154986986848812 | OMG You can't stay on topic? You trash every post with your political agenda. And you wonder why you was described as deplorable.Just plain disrespectful without any concern for others.
5 | Patricia Doyle | 1 | 10154986954613812_10154988412393812 | We should get used to a lot of new diseases if Hillary wins. They are letting sick refugees in the country with diseases we don't have built up immunity to because they haven't been here in years.
6 | Mandy Schaeffer-Algier | 3 | 10154986954613812_10154987706258812 | Putting polio-like is just a scare tactic. Unless it's polio than it shouldn't even be used. It's just another reason to cause panic and blame the small amount of people who don't vaccinate even though a vaccination wouldn't have stopped this.
7 | Penny Neal | 4 | 10154986954613812_10154988088908812 | Diseases being brought in from other countries....... that's why people need to come into our country legally...... our military when they go overseas to fight they have to take all these shots too..... and when they come back they have to be quarantined to make sure they don't have any diseases even the dogs......
8 | Hannie Klein Blackstein | 17 | 10154986954613812_10154987022208812 | It's only happening to kids that were vaccinated. And it's coming from Central and South America.

20 | Valerie Brosky | 2 | 10154986954613812_10154987771703812 | You want more information on this follow Marcella Piper Terry on FB.She writes: I have been trying to figure out for a long time why the CDC does not want doctors testing for EV-D68 in cases of Acute Flaccid Myelitis.Thanks to my friend, Tami Rainmom, I now know what they are covering up.Vaccines given to our children are contaminated with EV-D68, Coxsackie Virus, and other Enteroviruses.This is not a mistake. It's part of the vaccine manufacturing process.Are doctors and nurses doing this on purpose?No.Doctors and nurses are clueless. So are the Public Health Departments.But the CDC knows. And they are actively working to cover it up.Here is the proof: https://www.google.com/patents/EP2301572A1?cl=enEnteroviruses and Coxsackie viruses are used in both the Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV).In the United States, IPV is given 4 times to children before they enter kindergarten.The final dose is given to children aged 4-6 years - and was likely one of the vaccines given to Daniel Ramirez on September 30, 2016, just before he got sick and went into the hospital. Daniel's mother has confirmed that he received "required shots for school" in addition to the flu vaccine, and he started getting sick shortly after.Daniel's parents repeatedly told the doctors at Seattle Children's Hospital that he was vaccinated on September 30, and that he got very sick after vaccination.Doctors at Seattle Children's Hospital repeatedly denied that vaccines could be playing a part in his illness. They refused to consider vaccines as a factor and in doing so, they denied him the treatment that may have saved his life.There are many children throughout the United States who are currently sick and hospitalized with AFM. Parents are being told, "It's not the vaccines. It's the enterovirus that's mutating."They don't realize the mutating virus is coming from the vaccines.Doctors are refusing to consider vaccines as a factor.That needs to change. Now.Please stand up for Daniel and all of the other children, and share this information widely.#TeamDaniel #JusticeForDaniel #AFM #VaxXed #VaxTruth
