2 | Laurie Wordehoff | 6 | 1338819142881001_1338819969547585 | Republican Watergate? Thanks for the reminder Trump. It seems you have been awfully busy shredding and erasing documents related to lawsuits. You seem a lot like good old Nixon.
3 | Beatrice Rohde | 0 | 1338819142881001_1338821486214100 | What's really funny is that some of the players who were flirting around during Watergate just happen to be hovering around Tramp. Sounds convenient. They've been using some of the old tactics too.
4 | Mike Ryals | 4 | 1338819142881001_1338819426214306 | Now that the mystery has been unraveled, and the democrats dirty laundry is out, the choice is clear; if you want a government that is just, and works for all the people, then you will pull the lever for Donald J Trump. And the draining of the swamp can begin.
5 | Marcus Anthony | 0 | 1338819142881001_1338821762880739 | This is way bigger than watergate. Hillary assistant was working with the terrorists were supposed to be fighting. I wouldn't be surprised if all kind of evidence leaks 1 day before voting

8 | Jahfeeil Ya | 0 | 1338819142881001_1338821142880801 | So, to recap. Trump will go on trial in November accused of racketeering, and again in December accused of child rape. He is a sexual predator, hasn't released his tax returns, and has used his foundation's money to pay his legal fees. He has abused the family of a war hero and... oh, but let's talk about some emails Hillary didn't send from someone else's computer, that weren't a crime anyway, because that's how to choose a president. Come on, America. Focus.
9 | AJ Koehn | 1 | 1338819142881001_1338821096214139 | We are all so sick of what Trump is saying about the emails. It's just a constant repeat. Stop reporting it. It's as if you are purposely giving him the airtime to drive in his ridiculous messages to the public for free.

17 | Donley Matthew | 2 | 1338819142881001_1338820136214235 | The Comey letter leaked by House Republicans one week before the election (informing Congress that the FBI would review 650,000 emails on Anthony Weiner’s computer between him and his wife, Clinton’s chief Aide) was LEAKED as the RNC’s “hail marry” to save a loosing campaign. That the letter was made public by Republican House members is a violation and abuse of Congressional Investigative Powers in an effort to influence the election. Shame on the Republicans, more innuendo and no facts. These emails, like all the others, have nothing to do with Hillary, the State Department or the Clinton Foundation. The emails, when reviewed, like all the rest, will show nothing criminal or unethical. Perhaps not a single one is relevant to anything. There is noting too low for the Republicans and Trump to do to try to win the election. The fact that the FBI found material marked classified on the Clinton server doesn't make Hillary a liar or dishonest... The server was never intended to be used for sending or receiving classified materials. It was reckless and not criminal. She apologized, said it was a mistake. Hillary did NOT use a private server to hide or destroy evidence of her corruption or that of the Obama Administration. The Clintons did not use the Clinton Foundation to sell access. The Clinton Foundation is not a corrupt organization. It has an A (the highest) rating. The Clinton’s did not misuse government funds for their own benefit.. Hillary did not laugh about getting a child rapist off in the 1970s.. She is not responsible for the deaths of 4 brave Americans in the attack in Benghazi. She did not say their lives "don't matter", that comment was about the reason for the attack.  Hillary did not compromise CIA secrets and therefore can’t be trusted.. Hillary is not dying with only a few months to live. This stuff is a sham. EVERY ONE has been proven FALSE. But the Trump Campaign and Republicans still repeat it. Why? The False light of defamation. slander, and propaganda to poison an election. It is about the past, and shameful to the Republicans that did it. It is unethical. A little disappointed that you have not looked at the facts and this Republican smear of a political hack job. What matters is what Hillary and the Democrats would do when elected. When you look at that, Clinton, and every other Democrat is the only reasonable choice. What the Trump Campaign and the RNC  WILL DO if elected is shameful and a violation of American values and our constitution.

1 | Randy Martin | 52 | 1338763509553231_1338771559552426 | I hope this FINALLY convinces Democrats that we are at WAR with Republicans. They will do or threaten anyone to further their cause because they can't convince people of their hardcore agenda fairly. I hope Democrats feel as "conned" as I do about Comey. Take off the gloves, stop treating the GOP kindly and do to them what they're doing to you!
2 | Geri Winston | 40 | 1338763509553231_1338764546219794 | Newsweek 10/31/16~ "Trump’s many decades of abusing the judicial system, ignoring judges, disregarding rules, destroying documents and lying about it is not simply a sordid history lesson. Rather, it helps explain his behavior since he declared his candidacy. He promised to turn over his tax returns and his health records—just as he promised to comply with document discovery requirements in so many lawsuits—then reneged. As a result, he has left a sparse evidentiary trail that can be used to assess his wealth, his qualifications for the presidency or even his fitness. Should voters choose him to be the next U.S. president, he will enter the Oval Office as a mystery, a man who has repeatedly flouted the rules. He has solemnly told the country to trust him while refusing to produce any records to prove whether he speaks the truth or has utter contempt for it.

5 | Deatra S Cragg | 2 | 1338763509553231_1338788899550692 | If Americans aren't scared then they have not been paying attention. When people at Trump rallies start chanting "Jew S A" and other anti-Semitic slurs loudly and without fear of condemnation it is time to be frightened.  If you do not know what I'm talking about try typing the word :Holocaust" into a search engine. The Guardian, a newspaper put out by the KKK, endorsed Trump and members are now making robo calls in some states.This "garbage" is now on the main streets of America because they feel empowered and the orange horror has given them a voice. Please, Please....vote blue! IT MATTERS!
6 | Stephen Grabe | 1 | 1338763509553231_1338805386215710 | ahhh...a trip down "memory lane"!!!   New York Times had to report the facts in June 2002:The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said today that ''damage, theft, vandalism and pranks did occur in the White House complex'' in the presidential transition from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush. The agency put the cost at $13,000 to $14,000, including $4,850 to replace computer keyboards, many with damaged or missing W keys. Some of the damage, it said, was clearly intentional. Glue was smeared on desk drawers. Messages disparaging President Bush were left on signs and in telephone voice mail. A few of the messages used profane or obscene language.Such classy people and we now know that Hillary Clinton took furniture from the State office for her home in Chappaqua, NY. Her staff is shown on video advocating violence at Trump rallies and ways to rig the election. Wikileaks reveal emails that prove the Clinton and her staff have denigrated Catholics, "doofus" Bernie Sanders, millennials, and patriotic Americans. But she really loves bankers.Why anyone would want these people anywhere near our nation's White House is beyond me."Read more at http://www.jewishworldreview.com/1116/colon110116.php3#zjE4LVQwlwbkfzGi.99

23 | Kevin Andrews | 0 | 1338763509553231_1338811692881746 | A former FBI agent thinks the Clinton family has more in common with the Corleone family than with average Americans.During a radio appearance on billionaire businessman, and former New York mayoral candidate, John Catsimatidis’ radio show, former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom likened the Clintons to a crime family.“The Clintons, that’s a crime family, basically,” he said. “It’s like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.”While praising Donald Trump Kallstrom, who led the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800, called Hillary Clinton a “pathological liar.“God forbid we put someone like that in the White House,” he said.And he laced into Attorney General Loretta Lynch too.“The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation,” he said. “That’s the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I’m sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.”Kallstrom put the blame on Comey and Lynch and said the agents were unhappy with how the investigation worked out the first time.“The agents are furious with what’s going on, I know that for a fact,” he told Catsimatidis.

" Chris Matthews: If you like the way things are the way they are headed in this country. If you’d like to continue the destruction of our manufacturing base, and the jobs that went with it. If you like the uncontrollable immigration, if you like the string of stupid wars from Iraq to Libya to Syria. If you want to say yes to all of that, if you want to keep this all the way it is, fine, then vote for Hillary Clinton. If you don’t like the way things are headed you got a chance to really shake the system the system at its roots. If you wake up on Election Day and it’s the same as it is today, if its the same 4 or 5 or 8 years from now, remember you had a chance really change it up but you were too dainty to do it." What job does Chris want in the Trump Administration? Co-chief-of-staff with best friend Killy Cornway?

However, Hillary Clintons 33k emails are partially in those 650k emails and the FBI will see how Hillary lied and they sure the hell aren't about yoga and Chelsea's wedding!!! They are in regards to pay for play and a mountain of other stuff That's totally ILLEGAL!!!

1 | Kirstien Demuth | 374 | 1338664239563158_1338664466229802 | I believe we need a candidate that supports women and life.  Hillary is the best candidate ever to run for POTUS. Donald Trump is the opposite of someone who supports women and life. How can you support a man who has no idea what he is doing?
2 | Fredrick Gibson | 183 | 1338664239563158_1338668329562749 | Another thing about The Orange Menace... I can't speak for the other states... But, in the State Of Michigan, Donald Trump's background would be disqualifying as an applicant for State Trooper (Police). His financial background, as well as his psychological background would disqualify him. Not releasing his taxes would disqualify him all together. More importantly, applicants cannot have a felony conviction or be a SUSPECT in a case with the reasonable belief the applicant committed a crime. How can you apply for the highest office in the United States, when you can't even apply to be a police officer? What the hell is wrong with us? Why are we allowing this joke to even be in this race.
3 | Sandra Felberg | 66 | 1338664239563158_1338671349562447 | Hillary Clinton, a U.S. presidential candidate, is apparently in bed with virtually every enemy the United States has.A newest leak by Wikileaks reveals donors to the Clinton Foundation have been directly funding ISIS, and Hillary Clinton knew about it…According to a leaked Hillary Clinton email, Saudi Arabia was directly funding ISIS. They also gave $25 million to the Clinton Foundation.1. The fact that she regularly donates to her own charity for tax deductions is bad enough, but the Clinton Foundation itself actually puts less than five percent of its overall donations into play for the charities it supposedly benefits.2. We have also seen the numerous pay-to-play schemes running through the foundation that further disqualify Hillary Clinton and prove she may be the most corrupt politician not to just seek the office of the president but to hold ANY office.3. Leaked documents have proven over half of her private meetings while serving as secretary of state were with big money donors to the Clinton Foundation. What is most damning, though, is that many of these people simply had no right getting that kind of access.I am not sure what it will take for the American people to realize Hillary Clinton is a true criminal mastermind, but YOU better wake up soon or our country is doomed.
4 | Tirek Brown | 38 | 1338664239563158_1338675539562028 | MSNBC stop telling liberals Clinton winning because she's not!!!You're doing exactly what FoxNews did in 2012. You're blinded by ideological fervor (and ratings) that you can't see the writing on the wall...We (liberals) NEED people out voting, not be told the election is 'done and dusted.'
5 | Diana Goddard | 31 | 1338664239563158_1338681502894765 | Anybody who would vote for a man who, doesn't think he has to show the American people his tax returns, has absolutely no respect for women,doesn't pay people who,work for him,has obviously has some anger management issues. You just not thinking right. He's not qualified to be president. We will be another Trump failure if,he is elected and trust me, you all are paying for that great Wall of Trump. Not him!!!
6 | Sarah Lynn Fogelstrom | 24 | 1338664239563158_1338665872896328 | My morning thoughts... I woke up this morning and turned on the TV. Flipped though every single news channel including FOX and all they are talking about is whether or not Comey "broke" some kind of law because of the now continuing investigation on Weiners and Abedins computer and phones regarding the criminal Hillary. The media is so low they are going after Comey for bringing up new evidence found as he told Congress he would do? Seriously? It's about time he did his job the right way. Bill and the AG never should have met on that Arizona tarmac....any decent lawyer would tell you that. It was in truly BAD FORM and It broke the trust of American people and the DOJ(not that we trusted her anyway). Hillary made her bed with this situation when SHE decided to break the law and hide National Security info in an ILLEGAL private server hidden in her bathroom. SHE decided to use MULTIPLE devices and then lie about it. She DECIDED to ignore subpeonas, SHE decided to hide evidence and then destroy more. SHE lied to Congress and the American people and continues to do so. Comey SHOULD have at least called a Grand Jury back in July for all the laws she broke, some of which I'm sure I forgot to include here. The issue isn't Comey's timing with new evidence. The people should know BEFORE the election what is going on with this new evidence. How many people may have voted differently in the early voting had this info been out sooner?. Clinton and only Clinton should be held responsible......I wish for many things in this... most importantly her indictment....but I also wish I had Anthony Weiner's address to send him a Thank You card for being such a lowlife pig....maybe I should TEXT it to him.
7 | James Morrison | 68 | 1338664239563158_1338671436229105 | I dont care what anyone thinks..Im looking forward to Hillary being named President and see her victorious in spite of of being attacked from everyone including Russia and our own FBI, Congress and old republican men her husband made fools of in the past....Gingrich is washed up, Former speaker of the house Dennis Hastert who was there going after Bill is in prison, Kenneth Starr endorsed Hillary, and Bills going back to the whitehouse...Suck it republicans...This win will be a devestating blow to all  of your hard work you have invested in stopping the Clintons...
8 | Reginald Oliver | 10 | 1338664239563158_1338713846224864 | Not going to happen, Trump will lose by the largest percentage in the history of American voting ! I have said this from day one! He has no path to the White House! It's a science, remember Romney got 7% of the Black vote and 30% of the Latina vote and lost! Trump needs to get more White votes then Romney. He's not getting the educated White vote so it comes down to White Women. I don't believe he's going to do better then Romney with White women! This is all hype, selling ad space and news papers! Get out and vote and enjoy this wiping that Trump is getting!
9 | Paul Moreira | 5 | 1338664239563158_1338719366224312 | I'm not a big fan of Clinton, but Trump is beyond any adjective I can think of. So much talk about here emails, what about Trump and his child rape trial coming up? This campaign has zero substance, zero policy debates. Its been about slinging mud since the beginning. If these two are the best our society and political system have to offer we are in deep s###.
10 | Richard Kelly | 11 | 1338664239563158_1338692376227011 | I'll be so happy to not have to look at the collection of bobble headed Trump supporters that are put on camera every day to clean up his racist, treasonous remarks.
11 | JF Tash | 8 | 1338664239563158_1338682979561284 | Americans are rejecting the Republicans that has done nothing for the people except wasting money on investigation for political gain, government shutdown, payroll tax increases and getting paid for doing nothing and getting involved with whats going on between a woman legs that not their spouse.Vote and let them know Americans are sick of you. #voteblue
12 | Linda AkaLinder | 2 | 1338664239563158_1338721869557395 | If you are still undecided please just do this one simple thing, make two lists one that says Trump and one that says Clinton, then underneath their names draw a line down the center of the page and put Pros on one side and cons on the other. Then all you have to do is see the pros and cons to make your decision. Also check any concerns you have with PolitiFact. They just report the facts and they are not biased.
13 | LeAnn Ferley Feldman | 9 | 1338664239563158_1338674112895504 | It's time for the news media to get off the email and concentrate on the criminal acts of Trump. He is about to go on trial for fraud. Trump is about to go on trial for raping a child. Trump consistently makes treasonous statements. Trump is a criminal. The email is old news.
14 | Cheryl Clarke | 16 | 1338664239563158_1338669386229310 | Hey Mike most Americans already know who Trump is a sexual predator,a scammer of Americans money,don't pay taxes to help our vets,well he really doesn't respect the Gold Star families or POW'S but received 4 deffferments to keep him from going to vietnam,which my husband served in.So please tell me how great he is.
15 | Al Gi Carrillo | 1 | 1338664239563158_1338744816221767 | Choice Theory – Choice theory is the belief that individuals choose to commit a crime, looking at the opportunities before them, weighing the benefit versus the punishment, and deciding whether to proceed or not. This cost-benefit analysis primarily focuses on the idea that we all have the choice to proceed with our actions. Because of the punishment involved, we are deterred from committing the crime.Hillary Clinton is a Criminal and can't never ever deterred -is who she is !
16 | Diane Zabinski | 3 | 1338664239563158_1338725846223664 | What the hell is it going to take for democrats across this country to admit that this is a corrupt government and it needs to be fixed??? The only person who is not obligated to major business or NWO is Donald Trump. Even the hardest head has to admit that they have done everything in their power to disgrace this man and his family for trying to help this country. Wake up America!!!
17 | Eric Beane | 2 | 1338664239563158_1338736222889293 | Polls are lying. Hillary doesn't even have close to those numbers. The photoshopping evidence of people actually attending her rallies, and the non-existance of volunteers in several states to operate her campaigning stations. This is so rigged it's comical
18 | Michael Marki | 1 | 1338664239563158_1338712836224965 | WOOPS! Stephanie Roule almost had an intelligent thought but stopped short. She said Americans are in a tough spot. they need jobs, have bad schools, can't get affordable health care. She is right.... But needs to finish her intelligent thought with ......Americans are in a tough spot because of Hillary so every American should go out and vote for Trump.
19 | Chad Pontsler | 1 | 1338664239563158_1338688886227360 | I am disapointed in you this Morning Joe... You Chose not to report on DONNA BAZILE. She cheated . How do you give someone the Debate questions before the debate.  ( ( you said you like her )  I am sure your station and others have been Bought off through donations.  This just proved it . Joe I know you are a Repulican and the rest of your pannel have done nothing but slam most of the the Repuliclicans until Friday. And Now you are trying to avoid the Emails. I have watched you guys for a long time ... I am sad you all will support a Criminal Empire for a few bucks instead of what is  right for our country.  I hope you make thing right Joe....  MSNC does not seem seems to tear uo Trump and everyone else more than Hillory.. I know Trump may not be perfect rember this he is not a Politician. He is Human and things will fall into place. .Oh by the way I am a tech with Meta data it is known where things are sent and from. Also you can delete things from a harddrive a resore them unless blocks are written over.  The Demorcates knew about the letter and hillory lied so many times. go back 2 years and review all the inteviews . You will see she lied several times.   God Bless !!!
20 | Michael Vinci | 3 | 1338664239563158_1338677636228485 | This woman is already bringing our country to a constitutional crisis and she's not even the president yet. For the good of the country she must step down and face her charges
21 | Tiffany Lyons | 0 | 1338664239563158_1818268778413890 | Everybody, I saw a news report today on Chicago's WGN. According to the WP/ ABC poll, things are tied. I was agog but as I work with numbers all day, I did a quick calculation of all the polls from the last few days. She is still ahead but there is the enthusiasm gap. Folks, get  people to the polls. Register to vote and go vote. We CANNOT become discouraged over the Comey development. It is what it is at this point! IF HRC supporters allow for even a marginal drop off- she could lose. Stay engaged, stay motivated, and go out to vote! If we want a country we will recognize in four years time and not something from a Phillip K. Dick novel- Go Vote. Get the government you deserve!
22 | Barbara Bracken Martin | 0 | 1338664239563158_1338708702892045 | Yeah. Thank the media for sculpting election campaigns and final results. Cable news is filled with opinions 24/7.- opinions which (lazy) people depend on. Why not simply focus on facts. Leave you (I think) comments out.
23 | Audrey Brow Stapleford | 0 | 1338664239563158_1338689579560624 | The USA should be an example of how opposing political parties can peacefully work together for the common good of all it's citizens.  Hopefully, we will vote in representatives on both side of the political spectrum that will do that.  No one party has all the answers.
24 | Michelle Haskins | 1 | 1338664239563158_1338670719562510 | Let's see.. emails MAY be investigated announced out of the norm by a stout republican. The NEXT day trump puts $10 million into the republican political account.... Hmm..they are both corrupt. Vote independent #Garyjohnson
25 | Betty Saunier | 0 | 1338664239563158_1746995255565900 | Hillary DOES NOT support women and babies. Foreign terror countries have given HILLARY billions of dollars for God only knows what favors she has promised them. I just heard on the radio that Trump is ahead by one in a national poll. I would never believe a poll from MSNBC!!!!!!

Here are the answers to some of the key questions surrounding the latest email saga related to the probe of Hillary Clinton's private server
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Blakeney Adams | 77 | 1338622312900684_1338631776233071 | The bottom line is that he's doing his job. Like it or not, it's the truth. All the people on here making all the negative remarks need to understand one thing, Hillary Clinton did this to herself. If you have so much heartburn with this, maybe you shouldn't of nominated a presidential candidate with such a shady past.
2 | Ganesh K. Nathan | 47 | 1338622312900684_1338622879567294 | The FBI & many others have more than enough information & tapes along with many more women he has assaulted over the years.There is enough stuff out there to finish off Trump for good,all this needs to be released immediately!
3 | Michael Estes | 21 | 1338622312900684_1338647496231499 | Emails, private servers, yada yada yada. Why aren't you giving equal time to Trump's upcoming "university" fraud trial, gathering up the desperate who were bilked out of their life savings by that tangerine-tinted crook?
4 | Kristen Jones | 15 | 1338622312900684_1338639529565629 | If we had to hear about emails with no evidence shouldn't we hear about investigations of trump Russian connections? That is bigger than Watergate but no comey has too much integrity......So we had scotus 2000 and now FBI 2016....
5 | Karen Ullman Marks | 2 | 1338622312900684_1338762742886641 | Coney dug himself into a hole last summer when he editorialized about his decision . Now he is giving out info before any facts are available . In my opinion, both decisions by Coney were wrong. It is not his job to stir political controversies, but to announce decisions  once a case has been thoroughly investigated and resolved., if it involves public interest.
6 | Matthew Kangas | 0 | 1338622312900684_1338784919551090 | Couple of recent Hatch Act violators:  September 2012 – Kathleen Sebelius, the Health and Human Services Director, was accused of violating the Hatch Act when she made a political speech during a government event. Sebelius claimed that she had made a mistake due to a technical error.July 2016 – Julian Castro, the Housing and Urban Development Secretary, was found by the OSC to have violated the Hatch Act while being interviewed by television journalist Katie Couric. Castro admitted to the violation, but denied that the violation was done on purpose.
7 | Jan Clausen | 3 | 1338622312900684_1338645646231684 | WOW  Mika what a change of mind. Wasn't it you or your double I heard and witnessed you saying to Michal Steel how he was putting party before country. How angry you to get over his answer? Now you are all in with you co-host (Morning Joe) saying how Comey made the right decision. And you are suppose to be the level head on that program. Comey send a letter to the REPUBLICANS before he even had a search warrant to analyze the evidence? Don't you think he may have jumped the gun on his announcement? Every police officer knows you DON NOT say anything until all the FACTS  are concluded. So here is my question if you don't have all the EVIDENCE how can you send a letter saying that you do? Now when the facts do come out can we trust them? Now the integrity of the FBI the one law enforcement we look to, to keep us safe  This is a sad for our country.
8 | Shaun Matz | 0 | 1338622312900684_1338778799551702 | Anthony Weiner, used his wife's get out of jail card/black mail folder called life insurance on a laptop. Or they were dumb enough to forget it was there and the FBI found it. That's what happened...
9 | Rose Murray | 2 | 1338622312900684_1338677422895173 | Comey's job should be investigating terrorists and preventing attacks on American soil such Orlando,SAN Bernadino and the NY /N.J. Bomber all eluded FBI surveillance. And then there are the Russian computer attacks leaked (and altered) thru the criminal Wikileaks and Donal trump's Russian/Putin/ Manafort connection that is aimed at the rigging the election in trump's favor. What is republican Comey's reluctance to prevent this real threat to happen.
10 | Julie Borges Hice | 0 | 1338622312900684_1338784469551135 | An FBI source has confirmed that evidence has emerged from the Clinton email investigation that a massive child trafficking and pedophile sex ring operates in Washington.According to reports, at least 6 members of Congress and several leaders from federal agencies are implicated in the pedophile ring, which they say was run directly with the Clinton Foundation as a front.According to an NYPD source, emails found on Anthony Weiner’s laptop detail trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary Clinton on convicted pedophile pal billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s plane ‘Lolitta express‘ to a place known as “Sex Slave Island“.
11 | Timothy Wendeborn | 7 | 1338622312900684_1338626036233645 | Hey Mika, you deserve a Trump presidency. Let me make something clear that you do not seem to understand. I can have lead an unimpeachable life up until I went to sleep last night, then wake up today and commit murder. It happens every day. Now just because I was a saint until yesterday, does that pardon my sin today? Do you get it now? Does that put Comey's actions into perspective now? Holy smokes you can be obtuse sometimes.
12 | Robert N Johnson | 0 | 1338622312900684_1338752542887661 | Key learning here for Blacks to remember, it isn't always the Blacks or Hispanics who get targeted 🎯. It is anyone outside of the norm and challenges those with influences status quo.  So, temper some of the blaming and complaining.  When we're outside the spoke (either due to action or being different) then well always be targeted.
13 | Pat Gunning | 0 | 1338622312900684_1338680572894858 | The Leftists excuse making is collapsing rapidly....It boils down to this:Hillary couldn't be brought down by her own endless criminality or her rapist husband, but now, she is being taken down by a Sick, Disgusting Reckless Pedophile...This is the highest quality of leadership available in the Democratic Party... This is the garbage that needs to be purged from American Governing...
14 | George Gonzalez | 14 | 1338622312900684_1338623219567260 | Thanks Comey for fight the corruption this country need more people like you! It's time to put out bussines the Clinton's Cartel.

16 | George Dreger | 2 | 1338622312900684_1338714872891428 | QUESTION: What would liberals be saying had Romney been elected and he threatened Syria, then backed down, screwed up Libya in more ways than one, became a war criminal in Egypt, let Putin annex the Crimean and put a stranglehold on Ukraine, pissed off Israel, pulled troops out of Iraq prematurely allowing ISIS to take over, allowed thousands of innocent Christians and Yazidis be killed, then sent 4000 troops back to Iraq, broke a promise repeatedly to bring home troops from Afghanistan, cut a super weak "deal" with Iran, and after threatening Syria and backing down, and promising no boots on the ground, was now sending soldiers there?
17 | Staci Vikre Streich | 1 | 1338622312900684_1338669019562680 | Nice liberal spin - please don't talk about the candidate under fbi investigation nor her foundation being under investigation - that's 2 fbi investigations - heaven forbid you report the facts about the investigation - much better to point fingers.
18 | Nora Strunk | 0 | 1338622312900684_1338642019565380 | This wouldn't be happening if Clinton hadn't had her private server. That's the bottom line. Timing may suck, but if she had not had the server, again, it wouldn't be happening at all
19 | Cheryl Brady | 1 | 1338622312900684_1338631656233083 | Hillary will still win the election, but probably not by as many points now, due to the curve ball thrown by Comey. I predict a win by 3-4 points. Comey should have added at footnote to his statement: "No one should conclude from my statement that there has been any criminal activity in these E-mails until the FBI investigation is COMPLETE."
20 | Neal Shidle | 0 | 1338622312900684_1338754816220767 | I Bet Putin is setting back laughing and I wonder if our Fbi are so incompetent that Russia can get away with this BS.I THINK RUSSIA MIGHT HAVE INFILTRATED OUR FBI or manipulated it. Either way somebody needs to check into this or one day we will all need to learn RUSSIAN !!!!!
21 | David Whipple | 1 | 1338622312900684_1338694479560134 | Huma is Hillary's #1... Dumb-dumb-dumb; Huma didn't know her husband was sexting kids... Hillary didn't know Bill was having sex with them!Neither can remember anything...  You REALLY want these two running America?
22 | Shannon Whitney Colcord | 1 | 1338622312900684_1338662822896633 | Just heard senator McCaskill say...."Trump has done things in the past couple days that we're not even talking about.

Out of the 650,000 emails found on former congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop, only a small number will likely be related to that case, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation into emails related to the probe of Hillary Clinton's  private server told NBC News on Monday.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Terry Mehrman | 75 | 1338582239571358_1338586339570948 | MSNBC why don't you bring up the fact that Trump is going down for a child molestation case in December and the Trump university scandal this month
2 | Jessica Emerson | 54 | 1338582239571358_1338587809570801 | So Donna Brazile gets fired for doing exactly what Trump was complaining about, and yet, Hillary is still running?  How many other things is Trump right about?  Switching to republican, never a democrat ever again!
3 | Jan Johnston Villarreal | 18 | 1338582239571358_1338599706236278 | I awoke this morning with this election on my mind. The treatment of Hillary reminds me so much of Elizabeth the first. The leaders of her opposition wanted power so much that they put her under scrutiny, it was a miracle she was able to rise. Her inquisitions were brutal, her every word examined to find any particle to twist and use against her. She was threatened and taunted, called a liar, a heathen. They would take tidbits of what she said and make of them what they wanted to make her look guilty. I have some very good friends backing Trump. These folks have not really done their homework on Hillary, they have believed the many lies being spread about her by her opposition. Tidbits of her remarks have been made public out of context to make her look bad. Hillary has been put under the longest, hardest inquisition, she has been called terrible names and ridiculed, even her life is threatened, they have said to jail her (just like Elizabeth) and more. But like Elizabeth 1, she has stood her ground, under pressure most would have fallen. Some of my friends just are voting for Trump because of party, some because of their husbands telling them how to vote, but ALL because they simply have not done their research, have not looked things up rather have believed what they have been told. Have we not learned anything from History? Trump, by his own words has revealed himself. He is the most despicable human to ever run for office yet many still back him while holding their noses because of bias, whether it be party bias or bias against women. But bias is still bias. We all have a choice but this choice is so important this time around because this choice shows who we are as a people, as a nation in the eyes of the world and in the eyes of God. I am not going in to all the lies being spewed about Hillary because it would take days and I am not saying she has been flawless in every respect either, but neither have we. My question is, "who will cast the first stone?" Many seem to be willing to do that without the least tidbit of information..true information. I am sad for us all, sad for our country to think we might even consider electing a man to lead us who has swindled so many in business, blatantly mocked, called names, lied with almost every utterance and misleads daily. A man who has and is being sued for his dirty dealings, a man who has praised a leader who is our enemy and to top it off, a man who has absolutely no knowledge about government or how it is run and has not lifted one finger to find out. A man that takes no responsibility for his words, actions but blames others. I am tired and so sad to see what has happened. One Republican was interviewed on TV news and he stated that this is how Hitler came to power. That Trump is doing the same. He sees how dangerous this man would be and is for our nation and is warning all Americans. There have been countless Republicans come out against Trump because they know these dangers are real and their conscience will not allow them to vote for him. And there are others who have vowed not to back him in the beginning but due to great pressure from party they now will do it reluctantly. Our nation is more divided than I have seen in my life time, much like when Lincoln was President. This must not continue or we shall certainly destroy this great country we love. Trump has worked hard to divide us, every day he promotes violence and hatred. He has no respect for law, nor the Constitution proven by words and deeds. His ego is the worst I have ever known and he is self serving caring nothing for others. He would throw his kids under the bus if they did not do his bidding and even his kids know that. I have repeatedly asked voters to do their homework on candidates but to no avail. The Republican party got stuck with a mess of a candidate, their worst nightmare because they were slack, and now our nation is on the brink of destruction if we the people stay stiff necked and don't do our homework. Making a choice from lies serves no one, being educated brings us out of the darkness. My only hope is that good will prevail this time around. That our nation will heal from this evil storm and again unite and people will love one another like we were meant to. May the blessings be!LikeShow more reactionsCommentShare2 sharesCommentsWrite a comment...LikeShow more reactionsCommentShare

If he wins the election, but loses his cases, he could go to jail. Hmmm, newly elected president could go to jail, yet no one talks about it, not even his going to court.
5 | Sharon Diane | 11 | 1338582239571358_1338603042902611 | OK, I get there some concerns about her emails. But why is MSNBC and other outlets not pouring over the details of trumps upcoming civil rape case & the fraud case against him?!?!??
6 | Greg Caldarone | 1 | 1338582239571358_1338621642900751 | President Obama says Comey is a man of integrity. I'm sure he is. But Obama did appoint Comey Director of FBI. Makes it tough to now call him out on trying to influence the election. Just a thought.
7 | Julie Borges Hice | 1 | 1338582239571358_1338784556217793 | An FBI source has confirmed that evidence has emerged from the Clinton email investigation that a massive child trafficking and pedophile sex ring operates in Washington.According to reports, at least 6 members of Congress and several leaders from federal agencies are implicated in the pedophile ring, which they say was run directly with the Clinton Foundation as a front.According to an NYPD source, emails found on Anthony Weiner’s laptop detail trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary Clinton on convicted pedophile pal billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s plane ‘Lolitta express‘ to a place known as “Sex Slave Island“.
8 | Rich Roberson | 0 | 1338582239571358_1338654632897452 | Democrats have long claimed that rival Donald Trump is pals with Russian President Vladimir Putin and charge that the Kremlin is behind the hacking of Democratic email accounts as part of some sinister plot to help the GOP nominee win the election.They also point to alleged financial ties between Trump and Russia, but the FBI has effectively quashed any chance of this being true.The New York Times reported Monday the FBI sees no clear links between Trump and Russia. The bureau also dispelled the myth that the computer hacking was motivated by a desire to see Trump prevail in the race for the White House.Read more: http://www.bizpacreview.com/2016/11/01/us-officials-no-democrats-donald-trump-not-pals-vladimir-putin-406980#ixzz4OlDGBLSC

"...Duped for a generation by a party that kowtowed to the wealthy while offering scraps to voters, then egged on to a doomed rebellion by a third-rate con man who wilted under pressure and was finally incinerated in a fireball of his own stupidity, people like this found themselves, in the end, represented by literally no one."
10 | Paul Smith | 0 | 1338582239571358_1338721439557438 | Anita Croesus probably because there is no rape case these sexual accusations are part of the hillary Clinton campaign like the paying of people to start fights a trump rallies if you believe what the liberal media wants you to believe

If you want to make something great again...make it our Democracy and reject what DJT is trying to do to OUR (ALL OF US) country.

13 | Kelly Hettrick | 0 | 1338582239571358_1338673856228863 | Weiner is a smart man. No way he does not have a copy of these files tucked away for insurance.....Democrats made him step down.....Hillary and Huma threw him under the bus.......not a Democrat alive that does not seek revenge. Sure hope the DOJ and FBI come out telling the truth because if they do not Weiner will.........men can be scorned just as females can be scorned and the outcome is no different.
14 | Warren Murray | 5 | 1338582239571358_1338601086236140 | While there has been some life changing emails revealed in these illegally hacked private email accounts, it is evident that someone is only interested in revealing one side of a two sided political parties conversations. Any wise and just person knows that there are at least two sides to every story, so until I see what both sides are saying, these emails mean nothing to me. None of the emails show any intent of Hillary trying to illegally harm our country or any person, but we don't know what the gop and trump is saying or doing. Lets see both sides so we can make equal and fair decisions on who we want to vote for. You can only fool a fool, more than once and I'm nobody's fool.
15 | Tom Nicholas | 1 | 1338582239571358_1338637936232455 | Please tell us Anthony Weiner has a body protection detail.. (etc). With the trail of dead people along the Clinton path.. and the need to declare someone "the Russian spymaster".. I'm not feeling too comfortable for him.
16 | Rowena M Cleghorn | 2 | 1338582239571358_1338600526236196 | The media outlet that helped Trump is MSNBC'S "MORNING JOE". Not FOX because they always pulled for the right and CNN has always tried to be in the middle. And yes MSNBC was the left station.  But since Joe and Mika became bed fellows the so called Democrat Mika is Joe's echo maid.  I wish MSNBC would can those two deporable people.  Let them go to Fox.  I rather have Megan Kelly than Mica.  At least she not Trumps lap dog like Mica.

18 | Michele Macdonald | 0 | 1338582239571358_1338624009567181 | "...If the FBI knew about these messages weeks ago, they could easily have gotten a warrant and begun looking at them. If they were harmless—which I'm willing to bet on—Comey could then have either said nothing, or else made it clear that the emails were nothing new. Instead, the Bureau sat on this for weeks; failed to get a warrant; and informed Comey only at the very tail end of a presidential campaign, when there wouldn't be enough time to release any exonerating information before Election Day... Comey went public with this within ten days of an election—something that contravenes longstanding policy at the Department of Justice—because he basically figured he was operating under a threat that it would be leaked with or without him. If you had material that was literally meaningless because no one had yet looked at it, but you wanted to make it sound sinister, this is how you would play it... something smells very, very rotten here.The behavior of Comey and the FBI is somewhere between clueless and scandalous, but the behavior of the media has been flatly outrageous. Given what we know, there is simply no reason for this to have been a 24/7 cable obsession—or to command the entire top half of the front page of the New York Times. This massive amount of attention has been in the service of literally nothing new. Once again, though, when the press hears the words "email" and "Hillary Clinton" anywhere near each other, they go completely out of their minds." - http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/10/comeygate-looking-worse-and-worse

24 | Joseph Loreti Sr. | 0 | 1338582239571358_1338795382883377 | Hillary Clinton, a U.S. presidential candidate, is apparently in bed with virtually every enemy the United States has.A newest leak by Wikileaks reveals donors to the Clinton Foundation have been directly funding ISIS, and Hillary Clinton knew about it…According to a leaked Hillary Clinton email, Saudi Arabia was directly funding ISIS. They also gave $25 million to the Clinton Foundation.1. The fact that she regularly donates to her own charity for tax deductions is bad enough, but the Clinton Foundation itself actually puts less than five percent of its overall donations into play for the charities it supposedly benefits.2. We have also seen the numerous pay-to-play schemes running through the foundation that further disqualify Hillary Clinton and prove she may be the most corrupt politician not to just seek the office of the president but to hold ANY office.3. Leaked documents have proven over half of her private meetings while serving as secretary of state were with big money donors to the Clinton Foundation. What is most damning, though, is that many of these people simply had no right getting that kind of access.I am not sure what it will take for the American people to realize Hillary Clinton is a true criminal mastermind, but YOU better wake up soon or our country is doomed.
25 | George Dreger | 0 | 1338582239571358_1338714962891419 | QUESTION: What would liberals be saying had Romney been elected and he threatened Syria, then backed down, screwed up Libya in more ways than one, became a war criminal in Egypt, let Putin annex the Crimean and put a stranglehold on Ukraine, pissed off Israel, pulled troops out of Iraq prematurely allowing ISIS to take over, allowed thousands of innocent Christians and Yazidis be killed, then sent 4000 troops back to Iraq, broke a promise repeatedly to bring home troops from Afghanistan, cut a super weak "deal" with Iran, and after threatening Syria and backing down, and promising no boots on the ground, was now sending soldiers there?

He said the controversial chant he was heard yelling had nothing to do with Jews.

1 | Ray Wickline | 826 | 1338457106250538_1338458089583773 | Dear Trump Supporters, we aren't as gullible as you, so your Breitbart tactics don't work on us.
2 | Alejandro Fuentes | 429 | 1338457106250538_1338469719582610 | This is the classic rabid wackos followers of this shape shifting lizard, But after the election all of them will go back to their caves to hibernate for another 8 years.
3 | Bonny Newman | 357 | 1338457106250538_1338471842915731 | ....And there he is....The typical Trump supporter ...A fine example of an Idiot.👹
4 | Robert Jones | 209 | 1338457106250538_1338495696246679 | He learned that from Trump, the always response " nobody respects Jews more than me" Totally sickening and yes deplorable. Not only this scum, but 45% of Americans want Trump as President tells the world that we are not to be trusted, it's no surprise a lot the world hates the west
5 | Chris Maiuri | 194 | 1338457106250538_1338521432910772 | Wait, so what I saw and heard isn't true?  This wasn't 2nd hand.  The guy is on video.  He's as bad as Trump.  "I never said that". You're on tape saying that.  "Wrong".  You tweeted it.  "Wrong"
6 | Kelly Sue Magoon | 154 | 1338457106250538_1338487472914168 | I just watch something that clearly showed that he said exactly what he is saying he didn't. No wonder he's a trump fan, they have so much in common.
7 | Hannah Gibbs | 95 | 1338457106250538_1338567269572855 | His explanation of his chant is still racist! He said he was mocking "Mexicans" rather than Jewish people. It's still deplorable!
8 | Jeremy Miller | 77 | 1338457106250538_1338584469571135 | Oooohhh okayy, i totally misunderstood that. I'm glad that he cleared up that he was not making fun of jews and he was actually making fun of Spanish people. Yea, that's not racist at all.
9 | Jose Daniel Vargas Torres | 62 | 1338457106250538_1338481199581462 | I had a dream that Trump lost this election. And that Trump regrets everything he has said thru that big mouth of his. Trump understood, now why he lost this election. And Trump kept blaming his supporters for it. But it was only a dream.
10 | Andrew Riley | 59 | 1338457106250538_1338481296248119 | That's a grown man acting like a child confronted with 'who spilled the milk?' Except it's his racism he's scared will be revealed. Imagine, the mind that think's his excuse is remotely believable to anyone?
11 | Maribeth Ackerman | 38 | 1338457106250538_1338524702910445 | Coward. He's brave when surrounded by the other deplorables but when the real world calls him on his behavior he crumbles. Typical.
12 | Linda Lee | 17 | 1338457106250538_1338582846237964 | Not one Latin in the area yet he developed an accent to yell Jew SA. I don't know which is more racist 🤔
13 | Okunkpolor Osadolor | 10 | 1338457106250538_1338548659574716 | With the events leading to the 2016 US presidential election, I hereby withdraw the great respect I once had for the US and its political process.It was clearly misplaced!
14 | Michael Howard | 19 | 1338457106250538_1338580416238207 | As long as racists can hide themselves on the webpages and stay in the dark, they're big men/women. But, when they're caught expressing their views and acting out, they become  little boys/girls. Then they have a boat load of excuses or lies to cover their behavior. Aren't White Christian Americans supposed to be proud of what they stand for and believe? So, own your behavior and your bigot, racist views.
15 | Mikey Gee | 15 | 1338457106250538_1338590672903848 | You were bold when you didn't realize in 2016 that a video captures you every 10 seconds in public. But you're too deplorable and stupid to know that. So here is your education...you get an F for FOOL!
16 | Patrick Drazen | 15 | 1338457106250538_1338553976240851 | So he's blaming it on Ricky Ricardo and Cheech Marin? Nice try but: what ELSE were you saying at that rally?he stood and yelled, “You’re going down!” at reporters in the press area.  He told them: ‘We know who you are! You’re the enemy!’".
17 | Tish De Luchi Lomellini | 19 | 1338457106250538_1338525552910360 | Like Trump, this bonzo is a liar, and a "man" who needs anger manadgment courses. Boy, so much hate. Sad for him, sad for the country.
18 | Russ Blake | 6 | 1338457106250538_1338591882903727 | Here, and article from the right-wing pseudo media, "proving" that he's a "liberal plant".  http://thetruthdivision.com/2016/10/busted-man-shouted-jew-s-trump-rally-plant/Yes, it's clearly the same guy, as the NBC story also reports, but there's nothing about the first video to say that he's a Hillary supporter.  That's classic right-wing conspiracy nut-ism for you, though....he makes us look stupid, so he's a plant!
19 | Aggie Olkeriil | 20 | 1338457106250538_1338517002911215 | Oh really? Like we are stupid. He belongs to the basket of deplorable. Every Trump rally you see some of his supporters acting crazy and saying stupid thing. And they are angry like crazy.
20 | Jim Moore | 11 | 1338457106250538_1338563592906556 | It's pretty hard to deny. He is caught on tape. It is obvious what he was saying. Not just once but over and over again, loudly and with emphasis. Such a loser. Deplorable.
21 | Jeff Hamill | 1 | 1338457106250538_1853815484831491 | Trump campaign already condemned these comments made by one idiot in a crowd of thousands,of course the lib lambs don't know what a crowd that big looks like unless they watch a trump rally.Hillary can't draw flies,wait I take that back,that's all she draws.flies to a turd.
22 | Elane Salopek Bednarski | 3 | 1338457106250538_1707381699510531 | When I think of the basket, this Is exactly what I pictured the males to look like. Now I'm assured I was correct all along. A poor soul who ventured out to find something, anything to bring him out of the trailer, thinking he had something of relevance to yell and scream about. Of coarse it is about hate and most of all ignorance. Words matter. This is something most people need to think more about before opening their pie holes. Now, looking like a crazed animal he becomes a perfect picture of the alt right. Thanks for becoming the face of what I find disgusting. YOU! Anyone who would pay any attention to your rant must certainly look exactly like you. Now I have a clearer picture of what I should look for as I make my way thru my day.
23 | Emily Krause | 8 | 1338457106250538_1853773141502392 | Ugh why give this man a voice or chance to explain himself??? We all heard what he said. It was clearly racist. He's horrible. Done. Next. He doesn't deserve our time or thoughts
24 | Gary Morgan | 9 | 1338457106250538_1338551912907724 | What a coward. The guy can't even stand up for his beliefs. Trumpsters are like cockroaches, they run for cover when someone shines a light on them.
25 | Russell Newman | 1 | 1338457106250538_1338581316238117 | Stupid words Ray very stupid words. I am sure that the supports of trump stand in far grater numbers, it's just there not violent as you but don't take that as a weakness, may be a blessing on you're part . 10,000 people decide to attack what 200 protesters what the hell do you think would happen. if you and you're kind became the victims at a rally, it would wipe out two states before slowing down to a point of marshal law come's into affect, and believe me that is what they want for this country. the people you see there at the rally's are Americans fighting to save this country. why Ray, you as American become there enemy. why?

Meet Evan McMullin, the independent presidential candidate who is challenging Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton in Utah.

1 | William J Smith Jr. | 82 | 1553204641366227_1553313028022055 | I just early voted,,, My vote was for Donald J Trump. I have had enough of the Democrats elitists and the Republican elitists,, it is time for a new leadership. Time to Drain the Swamp.
2 | Donna Straley | 43 | 1553204641366227_1553303874689637 | McMullin, unlike Trump, seems like a decent human being.  The ads being run by pro-Trump bigots attacking him because his mother is gay & married to another woman are disgusting & typical of Trump trash.
3 | Beverly J. Fomby | 17 | 1553204641366227_1553385531348138 | My people remember to vote for Hillary Clinton! The only one truly qualified to be president in this election despite what they have tried to falsely and unsuccessfully say against us.
4 | Philip Oliver | 18 | 1553204641366227_1553348598018498 | As a Democrat - I don't agree with Mr mcmullin on much, but at least he is an intelligent and respectful American, which is more than I can say for Donald Trump and his hordes of inbred idiot followers.
5 | Katherine Licari Venturoso | 8 | 1553204641366227_1553332121353479 | He lies about giving to charity even kids charities.. shows up uninvited, takes the chair on the podium for a REAL donor and then doesn't donate a dime.. and he did the Macarena and danced out never donating a single penny ..
6 | Anthony Njigua | 9 | 1553204641366227_1553303661356325 | Hillary should withdraw Utah over the weekend and endorse McMullin asking Dems supporters to vote for McMullin and stick it to dt. November Surprise!?! lol!
7 | Michael Howard | 1 | 1553204641366227_1553573041329387 | It seems from listening to white male Trump supporters, they're very angry at their life and what they failed to do in their life. These Trump supporters are attacking any and everyone that doesn't share their racists and bigotry views. It was a White Christian American (that's what Johnson called himself) that attacked McMullin and his family  in a robocall that was disgusting. True Christians should asked themselves what would Jesus do with immoral talk and behavior from Trump and his supporters? Of course Trump's base would spin and spin and spin the response from Jesus.
8 | David Warkentin | 6 | 1553204641366227_1553365578016800 | MSNBC..YOU SUCK...For the love of GOD......You know Clinton is as crooked as it gets and will put us all at risk, yet you morons still defend her....
9 | Tony Garcia | 1 | 1553204641366227_1553358681350823 | You can’t fix it. It’s over.Hillary Clinton's race to the White House is over and no amount of “talking” about the situation will resurrect the happy times, she's finished. you have to reconcile your heartbreak and let yourself grieve, take it easy and keep it casual. I know it's hard to accept, but it's the reality and the faster you accept it and embrace it the faster you'll recover from the beating. Hillary R. Clinton will NOT be the next president of the United States and will never be. Embrace it... accept it... you people should have elected Bernie Sanders when you had a chance.
10 | Dean Henry | 2 | 1553204641366227_1553290858024272 | The repuGlicans may need to keep an open mind that their next nominee should be a an unknown for a change. Someone who comes out from nowhere like Bill Clinton did.
11 | Kathy Phelps | 2 | 1553204641366227_1553362138017144 | I was almost sold on McMullin...until I discovered his VP running mate was supporting Hillary hard core until this campaign. Then, I found it tasted a bit like a manipulation.  I'll consider him seriously for a full run in the next election, though!  Make it a serious run, and I WILL consider it!
12 | Regina Beard | 1 | 1553204641366227_1553813067972051 | It's only Utah so don't worry, we must concentrate on the entire United States! #HillaryClinton2016 #VoteBlue #DontFallForDistractions #ElectionYearShenanigans
13 | Richard S. Simon | 0 | 1553204641366227_1553647447988613 | It is a shame that this man did not venture into Republican politics early in 2016. He might have won the Republican nomination. Not that I agree with much of what he stands for but he certainly seems like a decent human being. That is far more than we can say for the current Republican nominee.

18 | Warren Murray | 0 | 1553204641366227_1553584441328247 | While there has been some life changing emails revealed in these illegally hacked private email accounts, it is evident that someone is only interested in revealing one side of a two sided political parties conversations. Any wise and just person knows that there are at least two sides to every story, so until I see what both sides are saying, these emails mean nothing to me. None of the emails show any intent of Hillary trying to illegally harm our country or any person, but we don't know what the gop and trump is saying or doing. Lets see both sides so we can make equal and fair decisions on who we want to vote for. You can only fool a fool, more than once and I'm nobody's fool.

There was a primary. There were 16 other Republicans. There were two other Democrats (however, the argument can be made that the Democrat primary was rigged). If you feel you're always choosing the lesser of two evils every four years, then you're not doing it right. The issue isn't the politician, it's our apathy. Get involved. Educate yourself on the issues. Vote your values, every election (local, primary, general, etc). WE run this country. The politicians work for US.

Then, on top of your novel you have a character named Wiener who sends wiener pics. Then you have the FBI who covered up for the antagonist then in toward end of this fictional novel does the right thing and stands up for the protagonist and the american people by doing the right thing and exposing the enemy (Clinton) and her international scams and her bribes and lies, but so far in the story then we don't have an ending for it yet because we don't have a winner yet in the election.

She, others like her and the media have done so much to hurt American democracy. Keeping the masses chasing their tails.
3 | Kelcy Cole | 110 | 1140793299338437_1140816732669427 | No.  He should be asking Kellyanne about the article in Slate today from some computer nerds that found a Trump server communicating with two servers in Russia.  http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html Is that connection under investigation because looking at the data posted in the article the communication between servers did not end with the exit of Manafort.

Maybe he is saying the election is rigged because HE is trying as hard as he can to RIG it. He is undermining our democracy and weakening us in the eyes of the world. He is not a patriot, he is not a nationalist - he is a ticking time bomb to our way of life and international standing.
23 | Will Tooles | 1 | 1140793299338437_1141081819309585 | Makes perfect sense; it's just a distraction. This guy name is on a ledger indicating he's been paid 13 million for assisting pro-Putin groups, Being investigated by the Ukraine. His candidate is cozy with Putin. Praises Putin. Changes the Republican Platform to denounce arming the Ukraine to fight against Putin. His candidate says the 17 U.S. intelligence agencies including the Federation of Bumbling Idiots (or FBI) got it wrong concerning the Russian hacking into US computers to influence the US election. But because he says there is no connection and no investigation we're to take his word at it? Double standards much? I guess if we were to fully believe Hillary the e-mail issue would have been like one of Trump's ex-wives -- discarded by now. Time to knock down the last bastion of the angry white male and the abused women who continue to support them. I'm with Hillary and she wasn't even my first choice. But she is the best choice.

Even the hardest head has to admit that they have done everything in their power to disgrace this man and his family for trying to help this country. Wake up America!!!
7 | Angel Merritt | 9 | 1140775036006930_1140800926004341 | Please stop showing us Trump rallies on your channel. Everything out of his mouth is a lie. He has created so much stress in this country. And you keep putting him on. WHY give him free coverage?

11 | Anthony Njigua | 7 | 1140775036006930_1140801479337619 | Hillary should withdraw Utah on Friday and ask her supporters to vote for McMullin and stick it to dt!? November Surprise! lol!

13 | George Cottrell | 6 | 1140775036006930_1140783176006116 | We should probably count out Clinton. The FBI doesn't re-open an investigation 11 days before an election unless they're pretty sure someone is going to be prosecuted. Whether it is Huma, Podesta, Brazille, or any of the Clintons remains to be seen.

16 | Joel Smith | 0 | 1140775036006930_1140870379330729 | Why is everyone acting like there is only a choice between Hillary and trump? Are people going to continue to take what that candidate would do if they are elected? Why are so many giving up and giving in to what our system has given us? We separated from England because they told us we have to take what the monachary gives us and live with it. Have we forgotten the Declaration of Independence?  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness. -- it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.” I will not choose between a racist unregistered sex offender who refuses to own mistakes or pay taxes, or choose an unconvicted felon who is in the advanced stages of a terminal cancer of corruption. Donald can only make America great again by learning to keep his mouth shut and his hands to himself. Hillary belongs in prison with a number of corrupt leaders. They are an embarrassment to our country and what we stand for, and so are their supporters who turn a blind eye to their inexcusable offenses. The world is watching, and they’re either laughing or crying at our plight. I want to be proud to be an American and so I refuse to vote for either one of them, I will vote for what our country was founded on, and if that doesn’t work, I will unite with others who have had enough to impeach whoever is elected based on the constitution which states: “The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” #NeverTrump #NeverClinton

20 | Joseph Loreti Sr. | 0 | 1140775036006930_1141325582618542 | Hillary Clinton, a U.S. presidential candidate, is apparently in bed with virtually every enemy the United States has.A newest leak by Wikileaks reveals donors to the Clinton Foundation have been directly funding ISIS, and Hillary Clinton knew about it…According to a leaked Hillary Clinton email, Saudi Arabia was directly funding ISIS. They also gave $25 million to the Clinton Foundation.1. The fact that she regularly donates to her own charity for tax deductions is bad enough, but the Clinton Foundation itself actually puts less than five percent of its overall donations into play for the charities it supposedly benefits.2. We have also seen the numerous pay-to-play schemes running through the foundation that further disqualify Hillary Clinton and prove she may be the most corrupt politician not to just seek the office of the president but to hold ANY office.3. Leaked documents have proven over half of her private meetings while serving as secretary of state were with big money donors to the Clinton Foundation. What is most damning, though, is that many of these people simply had no right getting that kind of access.I am not sure what it will take for the American people to realize Hillary Clinton is a true criminal mastermind, but YOU better wake up soon or our country is doomed.

Make no mistake, the news is virtually silent on this but if Trump loses even ONE RED STATE that Romney carried in 2012 (Utah, Arizona, Georgia, NC, Nevada) the election is over that very minute and it won't matter how many battleground states he carries...that's just how narrow his path is with NO room for error...my prediction is the election will be called early, sometime between 7pm and 9pm...

If you stand with the bad guys you ARE a bad guy. I'm not being hyperbolic either I'm just being honest, ain't that what you guys like? Straight talk?

20 | Kevin M. Carney | 7 | 1338122746283974_1338203382942577 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!
21 | Elaine Daprano | 3 | 1338122746283974_1338165806279668 | Yes he was.  I remember reading that he was involved with Goldman Sachs when they were run out of the Ukraine;  I think HE was the reason for the oust.
22 | Richard Bingham | 5 | 1338122746283974_1338232792939636 | Talk about the election being rigged. It'd no wonder he always goes into hyper drive whenever he starts talking about Hillarys supposed crimes.

24 | Roger Gluckleder | 1 | 1338122746283974_1338181432944772 | You got to the point of rediculus. ...Get over it Hillary in a criminal. Denial will only make the aftermath of this election hard for you to survive as a new media..And I use the term very lightly
25 | Hugo Morales | 1 | 1338122746283974_1338167776279471 | That guy never hid he had done consulting work there. That was before he came to work in the campaign. NO connection to Trump you fools.

Hillary Clinton's 6-point national lead over Donald J. Trump  remains virtually unchanged since last week, even after FBI Director James Comey announced the discovery of emails that could be "pertinent" to the investigation of Clinton's use of a private email server.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Michael Molineaux | 599 | 1338088372954078_1338089869620595 | The Con Artist, Racist, Sexual Predator Donald J. Trump can never be president of this great country... Vote Hillary Clinton!
2 | Independent Thinking | 396 | 1338088372954078_1338089939620588 | Trump can do a vag-grab and his supporters don't bat an eye, but if Hillary looked at someone the wrong way, they'd demand seven investigations on it.
3 | Patricia Snyder | 151 | 1338088372954078_1338090789620503 | The news about more emails to check, hasn't suddenly made Trump into something different that he was. A racist, narcissistic con man.
4 | Todd Johnson | 120 | 1338088372954078_1338090919620490 | What you expect? one candidate is a lying, mysogynistic, racist, fascist narcissist and the other used the wrong mail. Sane Americans will make the right choice and it won't be Cheeto Hitler.
5 | Judy Reid Rudd | 116 | 1338088372954078_1338095219620060 | The only reason Killary did so well at the debates is yes you guessed it she cheated Questions were given to her before debate and you wonder why she's called a liar and cheat she's a bitc$hRemember Benghazi
6 | Chris Carson | 71 | 1338088372954078_1338098189619763 | Who would vote for a racist bigot who openly brags about openly groping women, demeans a disabled man, demeans Gold Star parents, and has a temperament that makes a 2 year old look mature.Ronald Reagan wouldn't have supported this carnival barker - just ask his sons (one's Conservative, and the other is smarter).
7 | Sharon Kuchan | 51 | 1338088372954078_1338096799619902 | Why is everyone talking about something that nobody knows what it is! DEmand Trump taxes!,,,,,, what the heck is he hiding! No charities and Russa! Way worse than an email that have already been combed through!
8 | Lise Melin | 60 | 1338088372954078_1338093152953600 | Voters are very savvy.I saw this comment by David Wolski on an article I read, and it expressed my thoughts. I'm sharing it with his permission:The e-mail scandal is so small. Did Hillary choose a private server in an attempt to bypass FOIA requests and control what data was accessible? Probably. Was it an unwise decision that made the data less secure? Yes. Is this criminal and disqualifying? No. It's further evidence of her penchant for secrecy, driven by being under constant partisan attacks for 30 years. I'd prefer if she were more transparent. I do not blame her in the slightest for not being so.This doesn't change the fact that she is the most qualified presidential candidate to run in my lifetime, or that her policies will be great for this country.Donald Trump is an actual criminal. His list of controversies are long, and show that he has a history of fraud, misogyny and vindictiveness. I'll take "too secretive" over that any day.
9 | Kathryn Rubenstein | 61 | 1338088372954078_1338089919620590 | Emails Smeemails. No one cares about Hillary's email woes. Donald Trump on the other hand is a racist, bigot, misogynist, sexist, liar, cheat, fraud, rapist, sexual predator, and an IDIOT! Nuff said.
10 | Steve Hunley | 27 | 1338088372954078_1338128012950114 | Clinton just spoke in Cin, Ohio.Clinton had to talk fast, she has a fundraiser at disbarred lawyer Stan Chesley's house in Indian Hill. He cannot go to Kentucky as there is an arrest warrant for him there. He was involved in a class action suit against Fen-Phen where he and his cronies won many millions for the plaintiffs. Hardly any money was ever paid to victims. He was disbarred and an award for $43 million against him was ordered. He has avoided paying to the point of being in contempt and a warrant for his arrest was issued. Very similar to the Clinton's, people around him received felony convictions, Prison sentences, and some committed suicide. Looks like the Clinton's are going to get some of the $$$$. Birds of a feather!
11 | Robert Whittington | 20 | 1338088372954078_1338090679620514 | Don't know much about politics. All I know is on Nov. 8 we will have a new president. Some people will be happy and some will be pissed. Welcome to America. Next story.
12 | Mimi O'Reilly | 12 | 1338088372954078_1338168609612721 | These emails is not important at all . Hilary is on every ones mind to get elected and to defeat Donald ! So who really care about email that Comey is not even sure what they are ! Life must go on and vote Blue all the way . Let's kick out all Republicans out of the Senate !
13 | Leadell Jenkins | 11 | 1338088372954078_1338127076283541 | As well she should be after all the Republicans have tried to steal this election from the Democrats lets not forget Bush/Gore 2000 we must VOTE DEMOCRAT down the ballot or CON MAN DON (Trump) will steal this election by any means necessary
14 | Krystal Perez | 10 | 1338088372954078_1338130222949893 | PERFECTION! hahaThe "nasty women" need to stand up to what we think correct. The "nasty women" need to come together, so our voice is heard; all others who are with Hillary Clinton and her train-of-thought, of course.He is just afraid, about people seeing that, the "nasty woman", Hillary Clinton, can do the job, and do it better.   I see him, I hear him, and my blood boils. We cannot let him be the face and voice of our country.
15 | Michael Knock | 6 | 1338088372954078_1338164602946455 | More BS by MSNBC...Hillary's done nothing, but cheat,lie and steal...Most of you Millennials weren't around when she and her husband embarrassed this country and drove the jobs out of this country. She left a trail of blood when someone crossed her or disagreed with her....She screwed Bernie out of the election
16 | Sissy Bild | 9 | 1338088372954078_1338116466284602 | Why do you allow Chris Matthews to continually salivate over Kellyanne and let her lead a false narrative?! She completely took control of his interview with her and he allowed her to spew falsehoods and highly polarizing B.S. Maddening!
17 | Rhonda Sheptock | 17 | 1338088372954078_1338164839613098 | Meanwhile Trump is actually going to court for Child Rape and his Fraudulent University that stole millions from hard working Americans, shipping his work off the other countries while touting he wants to make America great, sexually assaulting women for decades, building his businesses with a Chinese steel, hiring US Contractors to architect and build his hotels and then not paying them, bankrupting his businesses and putting people out of work and not providing healthcare benefits for the ones he does have working. And this is all on top of him being a racist, misogynist, hate breeding, war monger who disrespects our veterans and war heroes and makes fun of disabled people! And we can also add that he not only lost 500million on a single year beating the great business man that he is, but found a loophole to then not pay any personal federal income tax for the last 20 years. So he isn't contributing to our schools, fire/police departments, servicemen, veterans, or any other departments that he states he cares so much about!
18 | Bryan Alexander Perez | 3 | 1338088372954078_1338151446281104 | U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2017So Much Wrong and So Few Seem to CareWord for word from the Cornell Law LibraryFormer United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Such as, say, President of the United States. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:?(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.(b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ?office? does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.?
19 | Thomas Moore | 8 | 1338088372954078_1338111792951736 | This post is B.S. and most of these comments show how ignorant and close minded most people are. Do some research for yourselves. Stop relying on FB for your political influence and information.
20 | Diane Marie Wargo | 4 | 1338088372954078_1338110999618482 | Even if she wins half the country will never regard her as the president. She can keep her wars, her heroin trade, her empire of dirt because that is what her and all the neocon and neolibs have turned our once beautiful country into.
21 | Avinash Feyad Singh | 5 | 1338088372954078_1338133542949561 | If you people didn't realise it. But from inception, no one really cared or knew exactly what Hilary Clinton's email investigation was all about. A pew research study found that more than half of the country didn't know what the email scandal was about.
22 | Joe Mazzella | 1 | 1338088372954078_1315956351748039 | Hilary Clinton. The terrorist and drug cartel leader. Anybody that votes for this non American criminal is an idiot. Trump 2016.
23 | Thomas Moore | 1 | 1338088372954078_1315873605089647 | Susan Edson used the term again...... According to Hillary supporters. If you don't vote for her, then you are part of the legion of deplorables. This country was founded on the basis of difference of opinion. But if you have a different opinion than Hillary you are a deplorable citizen??? Definitely not swaying my undecided vote with that one.
24 | Lara Ann Notes | 13 | 1338088372954078_1338101696286079 | Clinton is a failed, extremely liberal candidate with probably the most criminal baggage of any presidential candidate, but certainly in recent history. It's important that that American voters show that Clinton is not an overwhelming favorite in this country and that the history books show that, if she's elected, we could have elected a much, much, much better first woman president. American voters need to show that Clinton's presidency, if she's elected, is illegitimate from the start.  She will never be MY president.  It's also important that voters elect their GOP senate and representatives. This will mean more gridlock for 4 years, but it's better to get nothing done than to give Clinton the powers she needs to screw this country further. We see the results of that power from Obama's tenure and he has caused this country serious harm. Clinton will do the same if not worse. And asfar as the Election Rigging is concerned, the only way to prove it one way or the other is cast your vote and actually test the process. Go  Vote!!!  God Bless America.
25 | Tiasha Machuga | 3 | 1338088372954078_1338124686283780 | I don't believe the polls. I literally had a pollster hang up on me when I wouldn't choose between Clinton and trump. I live in a write in state and Jill stein is on the ballot in 47 states so how accurate are the numbers? How many others have been hung up on for not answering the questions the way they want. JS

If FBI Director James Comey has one standard for news related to Donald J. Trump, and another for news related to Hillary Clinton...there's a serious problem.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Favour Johnson Destiny | 990 | 1338050206291228_1338050976291151 | So, to recap. Trump will go on trial in November accused of racketeering, and again in December accused of child rape. He is a sexual predator, hasn't released his tax returns, and has used his foundation's money to pay his legal fees. He has abused the family of a war hero and... oh, but let's talk about some emails Hillary didn't send from someone else's computer, that weren't a crime anyway, because that's how to choose a president. Come on, America. Focus.
2 | Chris Finch | 271 | 1338050206291228_1338051532957762 | He's trying to shore up his run for office in the future by keeping the Republican Party onside...because he knows he's finished as director of the FBI
3 | Donna Kasa | 193 | 1338050206291228_1338053522957563 | A very serious problem!  No candidate has had distinct ties to Russia, and sex allegations, and Trump University, and things you don't want me to mention .
4 | Claudia Bee Malcolm | 104 | 1338050206291228_1338067302956185 | But remember what Donald Trump said..Russia if you are hearing me..I want you to find those 30 thousands emails that was deleted. .A haha ..This man is a threat to our national security more than Hillary. .As someone wants to be president thought he should be the one protecting those emails from the Russians. .As he have no idea what's in them..
5 | Jeff DiLavore | 99 | 1338050206291228_1338060036290245 | If MSNBC and CNN have one standard for news related to Donald J. Trump, and another for news related to Hillary Clinton...there's a serious problem.See what I did there???
6 | Rhonda Sheptock | 54 | 1338050206291228_1338083629621219 | Meanwhile Trump is actually going to court for Child Rape and his Fraudulent University that stole millions from hard working Americans, shipping his work off the other countries while touting he wants to make America great, sexually assaulting women for decades, building his businesses with a Chinese steel, hiring US Contractors to architect and build his hotels and then not paying them, bankrupting his businesses and putting people out of work and not providing healthcare benefits for the ones he does have working.

7 | Dale Whiting | 38 | 1338050206291228_1338084962954419 | So Comey has a double standard, one which applies to Republicans and Trump, and a second which applies to Democrats and Clinton. Now things are clear. DUMP both Comey and TRUMP.
8 | Joey Poirier | 29 | 1338050206291228_1338052602957655 | So, in a nutshell. We can anticipate a November surprise? Last week was Clinton and I guess...this week, it's Trump turn? This election sucks.
9 | Matt Justt | 38 | 1338050206291228_1338062366290012 | What about when MSNBC reports news of one fashion about Hillary Clinton, and then a completely different standard when reporting all their biased news stories continuously bashing the other candidate Donald Trump? Do we have a problem then too???
10 | Mary Serra | 8 | 1338050206291228_1630843090549549 | I am more concerned than ever about Trump's ties to Russian banks, especially since Donald has refused to release his tax returns. The hacking situation is alarming but the idea that American banks are not loaning Donald money but Russian banks are is something that needs immediate answers. I don't understand why the main-stream news media & the FBI aren't digging deeper on information that affects the U.S. in such a profound way.
11 | Michael Vinci | 21 | 1338050206291228_1338059876290261 | So let's recap as the person below me has stated there is only one I repeat only one suspected felon that is under investigation by the FBI for three major scandals and that is Hillary Clinton. She must step down for the good of our country before she causes a constitutional crisis. You all should  be ashamed
12 | Mary Ramirez | 11 | 1338050206291228_1338107476285501 | Absolutely, it's a serious problem!! Where is Trump's October/November surprise?!!?! Obstructionist that want to prevent Dems from getting into the White House!!! Comey needs to resign!!!!! Loretta Lynch needs to expose the Trump/Russian connection because there is, indeed, one!!!!! Share that with the American public, particularly, since they breached all protocols with Hillary!!!!!
13 | Marie Callahan | 13 | 1338050206291228_1338059789623603 | Considering Comey sending his confusing letter of innuendo to Congress, perhaps Trump is right about the election being rigged--in favor of Trump, of course.
14 | Tricia Meskel | 26 | 1338050206291228_1338060906290158 | Wow. People should not vote till more of this comes out . Now reports that Clinton left secret documents in a hotel room in China. That was reported at the time. She has horrible judgement. I think she believes since she has gotten away with so much that she doesn't have to secure anything. Soldiers are in jail for a fraction of what she did. All this talk about Comey is ridiculous because it wouldn't be an issue if she didn't set up a private server to keep things from the public.  She is the only one to blame!!!!
15 | Dmitri Alex Draznilov | 5 | 1338050206291228_1338071722955743 | Of course, Mrs. Clinton didn't do it. It was all beyond her control: the Russkies,  the lunar cycle, the mass alleged gropings of the opponent.  Mrs. Clinton did nothng.  She is clearly a victim of circumstance.
16 | Kevin Lynch | 8 | 1338050206291228_1338069639622618 | So let me get this straight.  It is too close to an election to discuss how Russia is committing espionage against the US because one candidate has shown himself to be very supportive of the Russian President and it may look negatively upon him that he is participating in this strategy to help him win the election. At the same time, it is perfectly ok to announce that they found some emails on Anthony Weiner's computer that may or may not be relevant to an already closed investigation, despite having no idea what exactly is in the emails since they were prohibited by law from viewing those without a warrant, despite the fact that it may look negative for the other Presidential candidate. Yeah, sure.  That makes perfect sense.
17 | Fred LC | 17 | 1338050206291228_1338057632957152 | Laughable, anyone/anything against Hillary Clinton is a Russian plant/agent, even a guy who was their hero until Friday morning.
18 | Bill Saks | 4 | 1338050206291228_1338071406289108 | Lol . If Loretta Lynch didn't violate appearance of impropriety . And have allow who Obama called the most independent FBi director of our time the keys to be non political on Hillary's email case remember one thing if huma turned over all electronic devices as she swore she did . Hillary wouldn't have had to worry the timing . It's her own fault
19 | Clifford Connors | 3 | 1338050206291228_1428340007180733 | Hillary Clinton broke the law period. She should not be running for president period it's time for her to go to jail . She can't be trusted period.. so let's vote Trump. She would not have this problem if she did not brake the law and lies. It's her problem. She is going to jail. Trump will be president. So you guys can cry all you want. Go Trump will win in a landside. Hell yea baby!!!! Keep crying while Trump goes to the white House baby
20 | Edward J. Johnson | 4 | 1338050206291228_1630832110550647 | Transparency was asked by all, both parties. Now or later transparency is needed for the American people. Of, by, for the people. All Americans required and reserve the right to make decisions that will uplift and promote the best interests of these United States. Let us join together and go forth, forthwith. God bless and bless the United States.
21 | Karen Ullman Marks | 3 | 1338050206291228_1338088782954037 | It certainly looks like Director Comey is being biased. I am sure he is of good character , however, I see a big mistake made in July as well as this past Friday. He said too much in July. He should have given the findings, a brief description as to why the decision was reached and then stop. There was no need for him to editorialize . There was also no need for him to say what he did on Friday, in that letter to the oversight committee, this close to the election. He did not know anything other than finding emails from Huma. Both times he created volatile environments for both political campaigns to deal with.
22 | Jacque Fisher Vance-Cheatham | 4 | 1338050206291228_1630805167220008 | I do not trust our Director of Homeland Security. He rubber stamped persons as citizens instead of deportation. Wikileaks told us they did not come from the USSR. They had an operative who worked for the Clinton Campaign that was killed in DC recently.
23 | Marion Rohling | 3 | 1338050206291228_1338062396290009 | Another shyster we the people are paying. Another day of obstructions & lies. Comey & all of the rest of the so called republican party hopefully do NOT get what they deserve, namely a president who would sell his Mother if the price is right, who will not stop until the nation is fractured so badly, that we will not recognize our country anymore, a maniac who could care less what happens to us. If they get their wish, God forbid, the very ones who screamed for violence, who are dragging us through the gutter, will be the first to feel his wrath.
24 | Stanley Davis | 0 | 1338050206291228_1428382617176472 | This guy James Comey has been getting all this praise about his integrity, the way it look he don't have no integrity, but come to find out he didn't want to put out information about Trump and Russia connection, due to the election being so close to the end, but you can put out emails about Clinton, this shows this guy is partisan and trying to tilt the election, he need to resign and put someone their with high moral and standard, who would be fair whether you Democrat or Republican, its all about fairness
25 | Nicole White | 2 | 1338050206291228_1630848457215679 | Why aren't you guys reporting about Brazile being fired for slipping Clinton questions that came up at the debate beforehand? Also watched the last 30 minutes of Meadows show. The whole time it was about Comey and what he did wrong and portraying Clinton as the poor victim. What about that there were people sent to Trumps rally to start fights? What about an RNC office being blown up in North Carolina? Nothing. Let's just keep talking about the poor victim Clinton is. You guys are pathetic.

7 | Bill McKetrick | 42 | 1338008156295433_1338032619626320 | So to recap, Donald Trump will go on trial in November for racketeering, and again in December accused of child rape. He is a sexual predator, hasn’t released his tax returns, and has used money from his charitable foundation to pay his legal fees and bribe a state Attorney General not to pursue charges against him. He has abused the family of a war hero, and openly mocked women and a disabled reporter……..but, let’s instead talk about some emails Hillary didn’t send, that are on someone else’s computer…..that weren’t a crime anyway. But, you know what……? Even if Hillary Clinton was trading oral sex and state secrets in the back seat of a stolen Subaru for crack cocaine in a 7-11 parking lot in the Middle East that doubles as an illegal abortion clinic……I would still vote for her over the ‘Cheeto Hitler’ !!
8 | Mary Linderberg | 14 | 1338008156295433_1338009276295321 | White House spokesman Josh Earnest called FBI director James Comey “a man of integrity” and a “man of good character" and refuses to join Democrats saying James Comey broke any laws.     Hillary Clinton has "nobody to blame but herself" for the ongoing issue of how she handled emails when she was secretary of state, her actions were "willful."    Clinton created this mess with her incredibly stupid decision to use a private server as secretary of state, she's only a "victim" caused by her own stupidity.     Valerie Jarrett threw Hillary under the bus when this whole mess started in an interview telling Andrea Mitchell she had given Hillary the SOP manual and told her specifically "no private servers".     Former Clinton Strategist and Pollster Doug Schoen withdraws his support for Hillary Clinton after FBI criminal investigation sparks "constitutional crisis"....     Grab the popcorn kids, can't wait to see who Hillary will "use" to spin this one or go after the FBI for doing their job, Comey is being an honorable man by notifying Congress as he promised on September 28th .... she unfortunately has always had a penchant for digging herself in deeper!    Going all in against the director of the FBI is precarious — especially after Democrats praised his integrity after he initially cleared Hillary Clinton in July.     http://investmentwatchblog.com/its-official-obama-attack-valerie-jarrett-throws-hillary-way-under-the-bus-obama-about-to-reject-a-hillary-presidency/

11 | Gino De Neef | 3 | 1338008156295433_1338015602961355 | This is what CNN officially says: CNN Parts Ways With Donna Brazile After Debate Questions Were Provided to ClintonCNN has severed ties with Donna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee and a longtime contributor on the network, after hacked emails revealed Brazile provided questions in advance to Hillary Clinton's campaign during the Democratic primary debates on CNN. "CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate. We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor," said a network spokesperson in a statement.
12 | Annette Kessee | 3 | 1338008156295433_1790788264502428 | Hillary Clinton has adopted 2/3's of Bernie Sanders platform which I feel is generous, so millennials know their guy will have a huge roll in her administration, and they will strive to carry out their platforms. We need to remember that they cannot do it alone. We have to vote BLUE up and down the ticket.

13 | Tracey Hail Hail | 6 | 1338008156295433_1338024486293800 | Now it's being reported that Comey did not want the report released by the FBI that our intelligence professionals all agreed that Russia was trying to sway the election becuase he didn't want to be seen as interfering with the election.Who else believes that Comey is now being investigated as we type?
14 | Mary Davis | 7 | 1338008156295433_1338026576293591 | Very misleading headline MSNBC. I am disappointed in you. The headline should read "Clinton still holds massive lead among millenials." Please be more mindful about these types of things. No drama. You're better than that.
15 | Warren Murray | 15 | 1338008156295433_1338023016293947 | We have had 8 years of an anti Obama congress and senate, if you want to start blaming somebody for what hasn't been done, blame the party that fought to hinder the man that the majority of Americans voted for, from doing what they elected him to do. I'm sure you won't because you don't have the honesty or integrity to admit it. The gop doesn't care about the will of the people, all they care about is money and power. They created trump the terror and all those who follow him, so now they're getting exactly what they deserve. I'm sure those grapes taste pretty sour by now, enjoy !

20 | Tobey Pelzer | 3 | 1338008156295433_1338048879624694 | The results are more significant than the headline. Did you think of that? Hillary still leads The Donald by 41% with millennials. What a waste of an article. #ImWithHer
21 | Steve Hunley | 0 | 1338008156295433_1790718161176105 | Clinton just spoke in Cin, Ohio.Clinton had to talk fast, she has a fundraiser at disbarred lawyer Stan Chesley's house in Indian Hill. He cannot go to Kentucky as there is an arrest warrant for him there. He was involved in a class action suit against Fen-Phen where he and his cronies won many millions for the plaintiffs. Hardly any money was ever paid to victims. He was disbarred and an award for $43 million against him was ordered. He has avoided paying to the point of being in contempt and a warrant for his arrest was issued. Very similar to the Clinton's, people around him received felony convictions, Prison sentences, and some committed suicide. Looks like the Clinton's are going to get some of the $$$$. Birds of a feather!
22 | Candy Clontz | 0 | 1338008156295433_1338048339624748 | The majority of millennial voters are 'children' who were raised in a world where all they've been fed and witness to is political scams not in a world that remembers and is well aware of what political values truly mean. Also, a bunch of feminist voting for her simply because she has a 'cooter'. Sorry, I for one will not vote for a woman who allowed our soldiers to be slaughtered in Benghazi then said "what does it matter." It matters because they're human beings and fought for our country. She has shamed and threatened the women her husband sexually assaulted. She freed a proven guilty child rapist. She denies her husband's illegitimate black son. She put our safety and America at risk with her email scandals. She's used her foundation (more like cartel) made her rich from money collected from countries that treat women and children like nothing. Pay to play... but for get all that she has a cooter!!! SMH!!!

We were called Young Voters in 1990 when I registered, they were called Young voters in every election since then. They're still young voters today.The young vote traditionally has a low turnout. Even when there's a record turnout for Obama the record is far less than the average turnout of those above 35. This poll reflects the apathy of youth, nothing more.

[This could turn out to be a masterful head fake by the Democrats and others with the mark of the beast/Satan. Remember, when you oppose the Democrat etc., you are opposing people who are inspired and possessed by demons. And demons aren't dumb, even if they are woefully unwise for opposing God. Or are we to believe Comey suddenly realized he's not going to live forever, that the demons, Obama and others with the mark of the beast/Satan can't save him from God's wrath nor do they love him enough to want to save him from God's wrath, and he knows he will have to answer to God, Jesus the Christ for his sins on judgment day, so he has decided to finally put principle/law and order, and over politics and temporal earthly gain? I sure hope so, but we shall see!] If it turns out to be a head fake by the Democrats and others with the mark of the beast/Satan, then it was intended to restore credibility in the FBI by showing they were impartial the whole time, otherwise they wouldn't have reopened their investigation, (they will say), and it will have the added benefit of further solidify Hellary didn't do anything criminal (so they will think). And if the reopening of the criminal is resolved before the election to Hellary's benefit, then my hypothesis is correct. Remember, with Nazi Democrat propagandists it's not about the truth, but creating perception in the minds of the simple minded, non thinking, reprobate Democrats, and lukewarm, cowardly, compromising with evil Republicans. [Remember, the Democrats and others with with the mark of the beast/Satan are masters of demonic inspired Manson girl street skits. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who have been conducting a woefully immoral and illegal revolution against God, Jesus the Christ and his chosen, (particularly his chosen of lighter color of the male gender) for over 50 years, and in the last 8 years that revolution has become extremely violent with the aid and comfort of Barry Obama Inc. exploiting the fear, ignorance and demonic nature of their blind, hopeless and helpless followers by constantly igniting, inciting and inspiring that violence against street level law enforcment and our best citizens, this they have deviously done while accusing their opposition of conducting the very violent revolution they are conducting. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who in the last 8 years alone have committed billions and billions of criminal acts of domestic terrorism and trillions and trillions of sins against those who oppose their demonic agenda, while blaming their oppostion for their criminal acts and woeful sins they have committed against them. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who over the last 50 plus years have immorally and illegally conned and wormed their way into our local, State and Federal government, public schools, institutions, businesses, churches etc. to misuse their temporary power and position and violate their oaths to their office and/or God's laws for the sole purpose of enriching themselves, family and friends at the expense of citizen working man and woman taxpayer, and to persecute, torture and murder God, Jesus the Christ and his chosen. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. in local, State and Federal govenrment who immorally and illegally funnel billions of taxpayer dollars a year to Democrat Party domestic terrorist hate groups masquerading as social welfare/justice organizations for the sole purpose of enabling them to commit criminal acts and sins against those who oppose their demonic agenda, while only charging and prosecuting a small fraction of their crimes, and never charging and prosecuting the millions raciallly motivated black on person of lighter color hate crimes that have been committed in the last 8 years alone. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who will stab you in the back of the head with a knife while accusing you of doing what they just did to you. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who since they got their way with Roe vs. Wade, have tortured and murdered over 60 million of our most vulnerable and helpless children, sold many of their body parts for "medical research," while using children as props in their political ads, while constantly claiming they care about women and children. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who enthusiastically worked tirelessly for decades to legitimize homosexuality and other forms and fuctions of sexual deviancy (e.g. gender flipping/tampering, genital mutilation, cross dressing, opposite sex pretending/make believing, anyone anytime sexual interaction) in every corner of our society by using junk science studies funded by sexual deviants and their symathizers to justify and rationalize their abominable sin (to gain public acceptance and approval and special rights not written/required in the Constitution) by deviously and unscientifically claiming they're the result their muted, mangled DNA, rather than the fact they are inspired and orginate in their fallen spiritual nature. Then these same antichrist Democrats etc. used the demon inspired junk science/falsehood to bribe, blackmail and intimidate 5 members of the U.S. Supreme Court to give them special access to a marriage license. Then after the unconstitutional and illegitimate ruling, the unrepentant sexual deviants celebrated their woefully evil deeds in defiling God's sacred marriage covenant (that they will have to give an account for to God, Jesus the Christ on judgment day and to pay homage to the demons who inspire and possess them) by tearing off their clothes, oiling up their body cavities, dancing naked through our streets like animals screaming and howling, shaking their fists, stomping their feet, running to and fro, wearing contorted over stretched facial expressions and eyes with a demonic glare, proudly and arrogantly puffed out their chests, beat them like savages playing drums and pointed their fecal and sperm covered fingers and hands towards the heavens and shouted on the top of their lungs, "*uck you God, we know better than you!" These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who promote the demonic lie that a persons gender is not determined by their God given genitalia, but rather by a persons fanciful imagination in their rebellion against God and his created order. And in promoting their abominable lie they have sacrificed the safety and security of our women and children in their most private, vulnerable moments in business restrooms, and public school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers stalls. I digress] Also, in the FBI reopening its criminal investigation into Hellary Clintons' criminal acts during her tenure as Secretary of State and that of her co-conspirators, it could be an attempt to get a bigger payment in their bungling the investigation or perhaps someone or some people didn't get the payment they were promised when they incorrectly didn't charge and prosecute Hellary Clinton, and her co-conspirators, so it's a power move to get their attention to pay up or else or it could be all the above. We have to wait and see what Comey says on camera or in a written statement within the next 8 days, and then we'll know if their move is genuine or more posturing to help Hellary, and at the same time to restore confidence and credibility in the FBI in the mind of the voting public just before the election. You can play your hand strong if you want, but be careful they could be setting a trap to take the pot. Play tight, and only aggressive if it calls for it on this one.

Then after the unconstitutional and illegitimate ruling, the unrepentant sexual deviants celebrated their woefully evil deeds in defiling God's sacred marriage covenant (that they will have to give an account for to God, Jesus the Christ on judgment day and to pay homage to the demons who inspire and possess them) by tearing off their clothes, oiling up their body cavities, dancing naked through our streets like animals screaming and howling, shaking their fists, stomping their feet, running to and fro, wearing contorted over stretched facial expressions and eyes with a demonic glare, proudly and arrogantly puffed out their chests, beat them like savages playing drums and pointed their fecal and sperm covered fingers and hands towards the heavens and shouted on the top of their lungs, "*uck you God, we know better than you!" These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who promote the demonic lie that a persons gender is not determined by their God given genitalia, but rather by a persons fanciful imagination in their rebellion against God and his created order. And in promoting their abominable lie they have sacrificed the safety and security of our women and children in their most private, vulnerable moments in business restrooms, and public school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers stalls. I digress] Also, in the FBI reopening its criminal investigation into Hellary Clintons' criminal acts during her tenure as Secretary of State and that of her co-conspirators, it could be an attempt to get a bigger payment in their bungling the investigation or perhaps someone or some people didn't get the payment they were promised when they incorrectly didn't charge and prosecute Hellary Clinton, and her co-conspirators, so it's a power move to get their attention to pay up or else or it could be all the above. We have to wait and see what Comey says on camera or in a written statement within the next 8 days, and then we'll know if their move is genuine or more posturing to help Hellary, and at the same time to restore confidence and credibility in the FBI in the mind of the voting public just before the election. You can play your hand strong if you want, but be careful they could be setting a trap to take the pot. Play tight, and only aggressive if it calls for it on this one.

You are hands down the best Political reporter out there and you deserve a raise! I just watched your reporting on the double standard of FBI Director Comey's decision to conceal an investigation into Trump former campaign manager and his ties with  Russian mob bosses and it's election target but demanded the release of information surrounding Hillary Clinton and potential email ties with Weiner. This brings question to Director Comey's initial investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails whether or not there were double standard in his findings in that case. I tell you Rachel Maddow you are brilliant!!!!!!!!! LMBO! I LOVE IT!

Out of the 650,000 emails found on former congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop, only a small number will likely be related to the probe of Hillary Clinton's private server.

2 | Amy Montgomery | 239 | 1337925292970386_1337930962969819 | FBI Director is a Republican....just saying. Highly suspicious. Media is not reporting every day on Trump's legal issues (rape trial in December, fraud trail in November and 73 other pending cases), yet every day, every hour on the hour we hear about Clinton's emails or the emails of someone else. The six corporations that own the media control what we hear and see. .They are trying to influence this election and we should be sick and tired of it.  Stop talking about the emails.

4 | Andy Charles | 106 | 1337925292970386_1337928086303440 | Why can't democrats accept the fact that their party is beyond corrupt. It's not opinion, that is a factual statement. Hillary Clinton is dirty. The Clinton foundation is illegal. Non-profits get tax breaks for being non-profit. The Clintons should both be indicted for perjury and tax evasion. When are you Idiots going to wake up and stand up to this corruption. Trump has a potty mouth. Deal with it. He's not a bought corrupt politician. Hillary Clinton will be indicted, along with Bill and many other democrats. The lies and cheating are finally catching up. Trump will win.
5 | Peggy Hardt | 36 | 1337925292970386_1337938169635765 | I just listened to the lawyer who is filing charges against Comey for sending the letter to Congress and starting this new scandal. He answered some of my questions, broke it down to simple terms and made a point that everyone needs to hear. Basically....the emails found on Weiner's laptop should be used in HIS investigation and have nothing to do with Hillary. They do not know what is in the emails or who sent/received them. Comey should never have connected these emails to Hillary. He implies these are connected to her personal server; however, without even looking at the emails, how can he know where they originated? If any of them were to/from Hillary, they cannot prove (at this point) which server was used to send/receive them. They didn't even have the search warrant to LOOK at the emails before Comey released this scandalous letter to Congress. So, what Comey did was reckless, calculated and in violation of the Hatch Act. He should be charged with criminal malfeasance. The FBI needs to come forward and denounce his actions and set the record straight, now, before the election. For the media, Trump and his surrogates to announce 'Hillary is under Federal investigation' is a LIE! She is not.
6 | Kate Baur | 19 | 1337925292970386_1337940466302202 | There is Nothing there! It's not even Hillary's laptop! It's Huma and Anthony Wieners personal device.

9 | Shane Harness | 13 | 1337925292970386_1337932346303014 | She had a private email server, she knew she wasn't supposed to. The president knew he was emailing to a non government email too. Instead of giving the server to the government when requested, they went thru a process of destroying all her mobile devices and deleting emails, using special software to hide it. Claiming there was no classified emails,but that was her only email, so how did she do that. Not to leave out they plead the 5th and wouldn't give any information to investigators. lol anybody with any intelligence cant argue what is going on here. lol
10 | Jim Williams | 5 | 1337925292970386_1337934372969478 | Unless the new emails reveal that Clinton cheated on three spouses and pleaded the fifth 97 times to avoid admitting he committed adultery, molested a dozen men, ripped off hundreds of workers and contractors and investors, defrauded hundreds of students, mocked a handicapped reporter, lost a billion on a casino in 1995 when the economy was booming, is going to court for fraud and raping a 13 year old boy, and used the money from her foundation to line her own pockets and bribe two attorneys general, I'm sticking with Hillary.

18 | Nora Strunk | 1 | 1337925292970386_700265040136645 | The biggest problem for everyone is that Clinton chose to have a private server. Clinton deleted emails.

19 | Rhonda Sheptock | 1 | 1337925292970386_644842839027709 | Meanwhile Trump is actually going to court for Child Rape and his Fraudulent University that stole millions from hard working Americans, shipping his work off the other countries while touting he wants to make America great, sexually assaulting women for decades, building his businesses with a Chinese steel, hiring US Contractors to architect and build his hotels and then not paying them, bankrupting his businesses and putting people out of work and not providing healthcare benefits for the ones he does have working. And this is all on top of him being a racist, misogynist, hate breeding, war monger who disrespects our veterans and war heroes and makes fun of disabled people! And we can also add that he not only lost 500million on a single year beating the great business man that he is, but found a loophole to then not pay any personal federal income tax for the last 20 years. So he isn't contributing to our schools, fire/police departments, servicemen, veterans, or any other departments that he states he cares so much about!
20 | Susie Shelton | 0 | 1337925292970386_1337997416296507 | CNBC is reporting that Comey did not want to name Russia on the hacking of the DNC and democrats and the Clinton campaign, and the Russians involvement of interfering with our election because it is toclose to the election day.

21 | John McGinnis | 5 | 1337925292970386_1337934739636108 | I'm predicting it now.  The FBI will come out and say there is nothing new in the emails and the republican Congress is going to demand an investigation into the FBI's finding.  They are very predictable.
22 | Jane Ferguson | 1 | 1337925292970386_644822949029698 | How nice after the damage is done. Did we really need to know the FBI was investigating Anthony Weiner's emails? No we didn't. Did we need to know about Huma's emails? No we didn't. This is just a really cheap shot.
23 | Thomas Entrican | 1 | 1337925292970386_1337998102963105 | Funny how all the liberal thinkers out there praised Comey when he sided with them, but when he goes against, he is called a villain. Sort of like when people don't think just like them, and then they verbally attack in the so called name of tolerance. Well here's a clue for you all, she is corrupt. Everybody knows it. Pull your head out of where ever you've stuck it and read the emails. But alas, all the sheep can do is bleat and follow blindly.

Then they will preach equality and how being a man or woman should make no difference, when thats actually the only thing that does matter to them.Absolutely ridiculous.
25 | Marco Valdovinos | 1 | 1337925292970386_644816062363720 | GOP is drowning and is looking for a life saver, any life saver. So Comey obliged. The GOP is in decline and the only way they can win is by cheating. Comey is playing partisan politics and at the same time further destroying the GOP.

VOTE NOW!We NEED as many Democrats and lefties as possible to get out and vote straight ticket Democratic as early as possible. You can also get a mail-in vote if you can't wait in line.Remember that we got stuck with Bush in 2000 because 538 fewer Democrats voted. The time to find out we were only short a few hundred votes is NOT the day after the election.I'm talking to you, millennials at the coffeehouse and others "too cool" to vote, you have to vote this time. The consequences are more than you want to pay.And you will pay.
11 | Timothy Baker | 8 | 1337878106308438_1337890036307245 | Yea like anyone trust the media. Only thing I would believe from the media about Hillary Clinton is when they finally say America you were right Hillary is lower than crabs on a slug.

This is the media calling LAND-LINE phones asking who are you voting for. How many people still have a house phone compared to 20 years ago? Not many... this "poll" is BS. LOL
14 | Diana Patton Price | 1 | 1337878106308438_1337895442973371 | Just a thought -- I don't want to take a job away from Steve, but he does have his investigation of Chris Christie to fall back on -- I've read that poll companies only call those that voted in the last election. There are a lot of new voters registered. Is it Ethical to keep track of the Early Voting?   I thought it was decided that on Election Day the media would not talk about the vote counts for a certain state, until the polls for that state has closed.  Seems like you all in the Media are intervening with the Election.
15 | Stefano Angel | 3 | 1337878106308438_1337921436304105 | The Trump brand is just like the person, a complete, total, utter trash. devoid of any sense of class, absolutely fraudulent, eminently tacky, and without style. boycott all things trump...ultimately the name and the brand of this dead beat, draft dodging, chicken hawk, tax evading, lying, cheating, philandering, grotesque, parasitic, loose cannon, con artist, nuke loving, climate change denier will be forgotten....erased from mention in the same way as the names of mass murderers and serial killers should never be mentioned. He is evil, vile, beyond contempt, with no business even being considered for the presidency.

That's what the republicans have been wanting to do way back when W. was president. So turn out and vote for Hillary. P.S. trump is a child molester/con man/liar/thief/rapist, and so many other things.

He is a pathological liar and has no intellectual integrity. He offers virtually no policies and the ones he does offer are impossible and mean-spirited. He is a narcissist who easily manipulated by feeding his ego (see, e.g., Putin’s comments on Trump) and highly hostile to those who challenge him. In his speeches, he encourages violence, racism, riots, and demagoguery. He is best known as a Twitter bully. When we look at his relations with his own family, we see more evidence of pathology. His brother Freddy drank himself to death. He has sued his relatives. He has repeatedly cheated on his wives. In short, there are an endless number of character indictments and no indication that he has the temperament, knowledge and ability to guide a polarized government through complicated times, nor reassure a public that is restless and feeling increasingly psychologically uncertain, vulnerable and ill. As such, the likelihood that a Trump Presidency would be a disaster with potentially catastrophic consequences is essentially undeniable..."https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/theory-knowledge/201603/trump-risk-assessment-perspectiveWhy The New Child Rape Case Filed Against Donald Trump Should Not Be Ignoredhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-bloom/why-the-new-child-rape-ca_b_10619944.htmlTrump Foundation lacks the certification required for charities that solicit moneyhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-foundation-lacks-the-certification-required-for-charities-that-solicit-money/2016/09/29/7dac6a68-8658-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html

22 | Alec Drake | 3 | 1337878106308438_1337908222972093 | Trump will lose Florida. He is underperforming the Hispanic vote compared to Mitt Romney and he also has no ground game butMitt Romney did. This is the same thing that happened in 2012 when everyone thought Romney would win Florida. Hillary will carry this state and she will get a larger share of the Hispanic vote then Obama.

Regardless of what you might think of Hillary, she is qualified to be our commander in chief.In the other hand, in trump we have a man that is proud of not paying millions in federal taxes a year that are the economic support of our armed forces and now, he wants to be commander in chief of that same military he never supported?As a wife and mother of veterans, I find that disgusting.Please, vote blue this time.

All you do is  talk about the e mails I am sick of these e mails already, but I keep seeing storlies about Trump that doesn't get the coverage it should. The rape case of a 13 year old is coming up, why didn't we know.  His not showing his taxes leaves me to believe that he has ties to Russia and does not want to reveal this.  All I know is that Hillary is so out there we know everything except what she eats for breakfast and with Trump we are in the dark bec ause he refuses to let the public in.

1 | Deborah Brien | 2214 | 1337804146315834_1337805966315652 | This woman has no integrity at all if she actually believes the foolishness she spews.
2 | Valerie Weisenfeld | 1711 | 1337804146315834_1337805919648990 | She apparently lives in the upside down. She must feel such incredible amounts of shame when she's alone.
3 | Jen Travieso | 1411 | 1337804146315834_1337805672982348 | Trump is the biggest mistake the Republicans have made and they will pay for it for years to come.
4 | Carolyn Peterson | 767 | 1337804146315834_1337810002981915 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks.
5 | William Toro | 864 | 1337804146315834_1337806546315594 | What I am about to tell you are facts:Only Donald Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women. Only Donald Trump didn't know the military didn't have a court system to deal with rapes in the military. Only Donald Trump talks about knowing more about ISIS than the generals yet he had his daddy buy him 5 deferments from the military to avoid military service. Only Donald Trump has gone bankrupt six times. Only Donald Trump has openly used donations to veterans collected then deposited to his personal and illegal foundation and use that money to pay for lawsuit settlements, but a self portrait, a signed football helmet and "donate" to the Florida attorney general so she wouldn't open and investigation in to the plethora of fraud complaints against his so called trump university. Only Donald Trump has over 200 lawsuits for fraud and racketeering pending in court. Only Donald Trump would have a pro Russian lobbyist as his campaign manager. Only Donald Trump would illegally do business with Iran, Russia and Cuba when it was illegal to do so. Only Donald Trump has zero political experience. Only Donald Trump is despised by the leaders of his own party which will severely limit what he can accomplish if he wins. Only Donald Trump has alienated world leaders. Only Donald Trump wants the proliferation of Nuclear weapons. Only Donald Trump made racist comments about Mexicans, Jews and Muslims. Only Donald Trump publicly made fun of a person with a handicap. Only Donald Trump called for women to be punished if they had an abortion. Only Donald Trump told his supporters to hurt people protesting at his rallies leading to people getting sucker punched as they left. Only Donald Trump has not released his tax returns. Only Donald Trump admitted to not paying federal income taxes. Only Donald Trump has called women fat, pigs and disgusting etc. Only Donald Trump blames the media for publicizing things that come out of his own mouth. Only Donald Trump has said he will support a peaceful transition of power but only if he wins. Only Donald Trump talks about keeping jobs in the US then sends his own company's jobs overseas. Only Donald Trump talks about the importance of improving the state of our economy and then used steel from china and room furniture and accessories from foreign countries to build and furnish his hotels.Should I go on? I still have the pending FBI investigation in to Trumps business dealing and campaign solicitation schemes! 😱
6 | Francine Lachance | 387 | 1337804146315834_1337813809648201 | That is truly funny coming from Kellyanne about her candidate, the pathological liar Donald Trump. Ironically, they are always making statements about Democrats that are really true about Republicans. Campaign strategy: best defense is a good offense.
7 | Gavin Michael Dillon | 335 | 1337804146315834_1337810746315174 | Republicans made a huge mistake with Donald J. Trump. Prayerfully we will reject him come Election Day! Remember it isn't our candidate who brags about sexual assault. #StrongerTogether

I DON'T THINK SO! Scary really really scary!!!!!!!
9 | Anna Bowe Gonzalez | 184 | 1337804146315834_1337812016315047 | Vote Blue 🇺🇸💙🇺🇸" Clinton’s email habits look positively transparent when compared with the subpoena-dodging, email-hiding, private-server-using George W. Bush administration. Between 2003 and 2009, the Bush White House “lost” 22 million emails. This correspondence included millions of emails written during the darkest period in America’s recent history, when the Bush administration was ginning up support for what turned out to be a disastrous war in Iraq with false claims that the country possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and, later, when it was firing U.S. attorneys for political reasons." Newsweek
10 | Patti Kielty | 92 | 1337804146315834_1337809639648618 | Tomas Davis, what a dumb thin to post. Don't speak on my behalf of what I might or might not be aware of. You don't speak for what "democrats" are aware of, trying get to do so makes you sound like a manipulative tyrant. What I am aware of is that You must not have heard about 911, or the 13+ Benghazi like attacks, 60 people killed, during the Bush administration. Or else you are ignorant and deaf and blind. Oh, and lest we not forget the 22 million emails lost during the investigation of Bush and Cheney.
11 | Maggie Wood | 93 | 1337804146315834_1337814669648115 | It's odd, but as the campaign goes on, Hillary keeps looking younger and more spritely.. ..while Trump and Kellyanne look older and more tired.  Puffy eyes and droopy face.  Too much fast food?   Or the stress of hating and lying from sunrise to midnight?
12 | Helen Flood | 69 | 1337804146315834_1143136699108672 | MSNBC! Do your jobs and start talking about facts such as Trump not disclosing his tax returns and allegations of rape of a child! Stop following FOX news and be real journalists!
13 | Sylvia Queen | 64 | 1337804146315834_1337813892981526 | That hooker gets paid to make insane accusations. The funny part is that in her comments, she gave an amazingly accurate description of Trump.
14 | Kathy Hudspeth | 77 | 1337804146315834_1337811796315069 | See this is what voting for trump will get us, more lies,more cheating and loss of more freedoms, especially health wise and women's rights. How you can make that kind of decision to vote for him and the reps is just appalling..
15 | Lyndon Mickens | 44 | 1337804146315834_1337814136314835 | Joe is a joke just like Trump...Trump goes to court on federal charges of fraud the day after the election for Trump University and in December he goes on trial for rape of a 13 year old...cases on court dockets.....name one case HRC has scheduled for court...I'll wait...
16 | Marilyn Rosa | 36 | 1337804146315834_902144516586776 | Speaking of serial liars! Kellyanne is right in line behind the BIGGEST one~TRUMP. Really, you both let her talk her bs rhetoric & didn't even ask about the anti Semitic comments at one of Trump's rally's this weekend. Pahleese! Having her weigh in on this & asking no other substantial questions about Mr. Paysnotaxes, belittler of woman, and Putin'd bff. Seriously, get it together!
17 | Janet White | 30 | 1337804146315834_902144069920154 | How did Rudy Guiliani know there would be a huge October surprise weeks ago?? This is a Republican conspiracy. Where is the FBI REPORT on Trumps ties to Russia. Supposingly 17 agengies have found a strong connection.
18 | Kathy Keller-Dunkel | 49 | 1337804146315834_1337815146314734 | Ok I have never been so disgusted by Presidential Candidates in my life......and will probably not vote for either one.....but for this woman to go on all these morning shows and act like she is working for Jesus Christ is the biggest joke of all. She is a hypocrite knowing the lies he spews everytime he opens his big mouth. She is just one of the many Stooges he has and they all need immediate Mental Evaluations. Hillary has her own issues and we have all known that for years......but this GOP group is a disgrace.
19 | Carmela Florence | 41 | 1337804146315834_902147653253129 | Kellyanne why are you trying to force Trump down our throats? A man you called VULGAR when you were campaign manager for Cruz. And now we know so much more alarming things about this man. You really don't care about America. You are going to sell us out for what a notch on your belt? I know you are a campaign manager but madam have you no moral fiber?
20 | Carol Parks | 26 | 1337804146315834_902175683250326 | Trump is not going to win the election. I don't know how she can say these things - must be getting paid an awful lot of money.
21 | Christine Zane-Ott | 22 | 1337804146315834_1157345950986714 | OMG the delusional perception of truth. Hillary came it at top of list for truth and had no pants-on-fire. Trump came in at 70% bottom of all the candidates running for President for distortions, lies and pants-On-fire. Worst ever....Bottom dweller....SO whose the serial liar??????
22 | Margaret Falcone | 30 | 1337804146315834_1337817039647878 | This woman will do and say anything to help Trump..WHY?? It certainly is not because she is so stupid as to believe her own lies..IT has to be a money $$$$ deal..Hope she got paid UP FRONT by Trump...
23 | Dar Sebelius Klitzka | 26 | 1337804146315834_1157347210986588 | She made a mistake hitching her wagon to Trump knowing the scum he was, the lies he told, the unethical integrity he had. She knew this because she was on another candidates team before she moved to Trump and saw it first hand. She's not just clueless......she's BRAINDEAD!
24 | Carol Eileen | 22 | 1337804146315834_902146093253285 | You could say the same thing about your boss. It would go like this. “They made a huge mistake by nominating someone they know is a serial liar, has a history of having a casual relationship in regards to having respect for women, and always putting The Donald first.”How's that Kelley
25 | Nicole Martell-Nicol | 12 | 1337804146315834_1143123715776637 | I am a reading a book from before 2005, in which Ms. Conway is one to pick up on Republican lies or part truth and runs with them, spinning them negatively especially where it concerns the Clintons. The thing I don't understand is why she isn't called out about the fact that her husband was one of Paula Jones attorneys at the time President Clinton was being impeached, and that she seems to have done pretty well at their expense, as had many of the Clintons other accusers. There is a whole industry that depends on people not looking for the actual truth about the Clintons. Are they perfect, nope, and the have been the first to admit it. If you actually do some research though, many of Mr. Trump's advisors or confidents, at least since he started running for president, have been involved in Anti-Clinton propaganda for decades, and not much of it is legitimate.

1 | Kirstien Demuth | 348 | 1337751689654413_1337752199654362 | God bless Hillary! The conservative media and corrupt republicans will stop at nothing to try and destroy this woman! They know full well how corrupt, vile, and dishonest Trump is. I pray to God that he will keep Hillary strong and people will not buy into all the lies being spread by conservative controlled medias.
2 | Nana Lee | 214 | 1337751689654413_1337752659654316 | The Hatch Act prohibits FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Reid said that by releasing this information, which he says is not conclusive or pertinent, Comey may have broken the law. Reid referenced a memo from Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates from March of this year that establishes all Justice Department employees, including Comey, are subject to the Hatch Act.
3 | Alec Drake | 166 | 1337751689654413_1337757372987178 | Most people like myself have made up our minds about the emails a long time ago. I was planning on voting for Hillary before and am now more determined then ever to vote for her now. The stakes are too high and I trust Hillary Clinton with the future of this country more then I do Trump. If Trump supporters can overlook all the scandals and issues about him, then I can do the same about Hillary. I also still think she is going to win. If Hillary wins North Carolina, Trump can't win.
4 | Daniel Resto | 120 | 1337751689654413_1337759712986944 | What bothers me the most is the fact that Comey issues a letter that lacks any serious factual information, and three days later hasn't come forward to provide much-needed information.
5 | Raymond Towler | 84 | 1337751689654413_1337757526320496 | 538 has Hillary at 78% to win the election in first polls taken after the Comey letter. People that are voting for Hillary are still voting Hillary. Trump people are still voting Trump. Polls not showing movement in either direction
6 | Gutierrez Ralph | 36 | 1337751689654413_1337755106320738 | Of course it will. I switched parties because in my opinion Trump is worse than Hillary in every way. Unfortunately the media has always focused on e-mails that don't matter and because of this Trump will be president and will reverse allot of Obama's executive actions. Nothing will get done in congress and our standing in the world will shrink to a rising Russia.
7 | Sally Lenz Forness | 29 | 1337751689654413_1337767846319464 | I might care in another election, but Trump is the alternative. Don't give a rat's a@& about emails that may or may not have anything new. Worst case she has to step down and we get Kaine as President. I'll take that any day over Trump/Pence and their hate filled, misogynistic, agenda!
8 | Kimberly Cooper Brown | 16 | 1337751689654413_1337756546320594 | I know all media would love it if the race becomes closer cause you know their ratings depend on it so from now on I don't believe much of what they say without fact checking everything they say I'm so disappointed in MSNBC I used to trust them but after this election there are only a couple of them I still sort of trust. Sad that they have turned into a reality show instead of a trusted news organization
9 | Tony Blackie Clouds | 13 | 1337751689654413_1337762192986696 | The liberal comments here are so blatantly ignorant. Always blaming everything and everybody for the DNC and Hillary's failures. Hillary did this to herself. Don't blame poor timing on political agenda. The FBI do not accomodate felons. What a bunch of morons and losers....
10 | Blair D. Scott Sr. | 18 | 1337751689654413_1337761166320132 | Trump was caught on tape, talking about attacking women, and another tape trying to kiss a woman, and saying something, ignorant on TV, while she stood there with him. Trump, he is a tax dodger, and racist, and yet people like and follow him. But they call Hillary names, and it has been proven, by "Fact Checkers", that Trump lied 80% of the time. Say what you want about Hillary, but remember this, Jim Jones in November 1978, had so many people drink his poison, look what happened to them. By the way, God is on Hillary side....Trump is living proof in 2016, that "Pride Comes Before Destruction", God's Word is true...Trump is Done, Cooked and Finished. More To Come, It Ain't Over, There Is Another Tape !!!

12 | Paul Phillip Tomlin III | 7 | 1337751689654413_1337759449653637 | No, not really. This is just a setback and she'll still be fighting, Hillary is a proven fighter and knows how to deal with these kinds of accusations.That's because she's been doing a lot of this kind of coverup recently. What is coming this week from Wikileaks, Project Vertitas, and all the centipedes out there will shake her campaign to its core.
13 | David Salemi | 9 | 1337751689654413_1337793742983541 | Lol no, we know she's a liar. There is no debating this fact. But, I think anyone with half a brain still knows that crooked Hillary is better than clueless Drumpf. Worse election in history, but still an easy choice, unless you also believe climate change is a Chinese conspiracy.
14 | Tracy Hornschuch | 16 | 1337751689654413_1337803036315945 | I like what my mother said. Hillary deserves a medal after winning next week for withstanding as much as she has since she has announced. There may be a small impact, but I strongly believe this will not cause her to lose. We will win if we get out and vote democratic!
15 | Jim James | 7 | 1337751689654413_1337804029649179 | As has been the case with every attack on Hillary Clinton, this is just one more ridiculous and desperate attack in hopes of getting a dangerous person in Donald Trump elected. A man even the Republicans fear.
16 | Connie Greene | 8 | 1337751689654413_1337791349650447 | I have not watched any news since this news broke. I follow the percentage polls. Silver and Princeton University polls. They are factual and less excitable. My political group provides support and encouragement. Enough of the emails and biased media already. VOTE
17 | Gretchen Cowen | 6 | 1337751689654413_1337798246316424 | Not if you quit spending every waking moment acting like it should when you know it shouldn't! I've been a long time fan, but I'm really sick of you guys and your double standard this year. You've spent at least as much time talking about Hillary's stupid emails as you have all of Trump's scandals put together. You usually give his about one news cycle and they're gone. And you don't talk about the child rape case at all. Seems unfair, yes, but not in the way he's claiming. You guys are doing his job for him!
18 | Pat Pusey | 4 | 1337751689654413_1337773106318938 | Not if the biased media have anything to do with it. She is corrupt to the core. I do not care if Donald Trump called a woman fat. I do not care if he tried to sleep with a woman or if he likes "beautiful" women. I care that he sent a plane to pick up 200 Marines who were stranded after desert storm. I care that he supports our police officers and first responders. I care that he supports guns and standing behind our military. I care that he supports the death penalty and is AGAINST abortion. I care that he supports enforcing immigration laws. I care that he wants to destroy radical Islamic groups. I care that he supports COAL. These are things I care about. Him talking sexually about women does not bother me. Were they mean words? Yes. Were they words spoken in PRIVATE? Yes. Have you ever talked to your friends about the opposite sex in private and said things? I'm positive all of you have. But, News Flash!! Women have been sexualized for centuries!! Jay-Z, Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne and every single other rapper helped establish that platform, but people are ok with music blasted all over the radio degrading women. Ever heard of Victoria Secret? Or their fashion show? Ever heard of Hooters? People are ok with that too. Until all of these things are different, women will be viewed this way. Your precious Obama couldn't change that and Hillary can't either. I feel sorry for the women Donald has belittled and said terrible things about. But I'm still much more offended by what Hillary Clinton has DONE over what Donald Trump has SAID... PERIOD!!!! So Trump doesn't do well at the debates, maybe he even sounds childish and incapable. But he is speaking the truth! Just because he's not a polished politician like Hilary or Obama doesn't mean he's unqualified to be president. He cares for this country, not growing the size of his pockets. That man has so much money he could never spend it all. He gets NOTHING out of being president! I'm standing for the man accused of saying mean words. I'll never back a woman under four different scandal investigations, possible murder at Benghazi, and the secretive email scandal Clinton's Foundation which has been nothing but lies from the beginning. Trump 2016!!!
19 | Richard Howell | 2 | 1337751689654413_1337790549650527 | The FBI must provide security clearance information to determine if the FBI developers had the rights to interrogate State Department classified information. What is quite apparent to me is the answer will be no. This will put Donald Trump in a precarious position after the election, even if he win, he will be charged and impeached immediately.This seems to be the Republican Plan in order to make way for Pence. Donald Trump is a very sick individual, and anyone who supports this man is as sick as he is. This is all predicated around discrimination against women and non-whites, and control by the want to be “alpha males”, the silver backs, the white men of the United States.There should be a thorough investigation of those involved in attempting to gather information concerning the email issue. To even access classified materials that you have not been approved to access is a violation this includes FBI developers. If you attempt to open a classified email that you are not cleared to see is a violations. To review any of the classified information that you are not cleared for is a violation. To speak about classified information as Donald Trump is doing is a violation of the law.You have these racist white men getting on MSBC and calling people lies and venting their racist view all over MSNBC. What is MSNBC, CNN, FOX attempting to do by allowing the venting racist to spread their lying racist views and attacks on a former President’s wife. MSNBC seems to be so wrap in it rating over the other cable news outlet that it risking creating a race war. The white racist that appeared on MSNBC around 12:00 Noon vented his racist lies, calling another man’s wife lies. If he did this in the present of the husband he would have his head bust open. They seem to forget that she is under the protection of the Secret Service. He claimed that he has seen some of the proof, if so; he will be arrested in the near future for viewing classified materials without the proper security clearance.
20 | Steven Charles | 2 | 1337751689654413_565798120272811 | I am so very disappointed as I see one anchor after another attempting to make a story out of some pretend "hypocrisy of the left", because of previously praising Comey's neutrality!!  Well, he's not being very neutral now, and has done something unprecedented, and possibly unlawful! So should we not say anything, “When the facts change, I change my mind.  What do you do, sir?” . . . - John Maynard Keynes What kind of "journalism", beyond lame, "gotcha" bs, are your reporters exhibiting?

23 | Rhonda Sheptock | 5 | 1337751689654413_1337804542982461 | Meanwhile Trump is actually going to court for Child Rape and his Fraudulent University that stole millions from hard working Americans, shipping his work off the other countries while touting he wants to make America great, sexually assaulting women for decades, building his businesses with a Chinese steel, hiring US Contractors to architect and build his hotels and then not paying them, bankrupting his businesses and putting people out of work and not providing healthcare benefits for the ones he does have working. And this is all on top of him being a racist, misogynist, hate breeding, war monger who disrespects our veterans and war heroes and makes fun of disabled people! And we can also add that he not only lost 500million on a single year beating the great business man that he is, but found a loophole to then not pay any personal federal income tax for the last 20 years. So he isn't contributing to our schools, fire/police departments, servicemen, veterans, or any other departments that he states he cares so much about!
24 | Carolyn Peterson | 1 | 1337751689654413_1337810119648570 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks.
25 | Susie Shelton | 2 | 1337751689654413_709802542501929 | The democrats are going to the polls and voting in high numbers. Voters hate trump. How can the people trust the cable news channels? The FBI cannot be trusted now. We have the Russians and the KGB interfering with our election and the cable news channels want to lie about the Clintons without any facts. Trump has lawsuits in the courts and the cable news channels are defending Comey and blaming Loretta Lynch. Why should the people believe the cable news channels? Get out and vote. Do not let the Russians, the republicans, trump, Comey and the cable news channels suppress the vote. If you are angry with the way the republicans waste the money and abuse their power get out and vote for a democrat congress. Our votes count not the media polls. Vote Democrat. since the Russians and KGB wants trump.

7 | Tebkap Pak | 41 | 1337688816327367_1337690036327245 | Hillary Clinton’s $500,000 Bribe to the FBI Came Through Virginia – CONFIRMED!The question we are all thinking of so much time now, is how on earth does Hillary gets away without charges with more than 50 FBI agents assigned to investigate her illegal use of a private email server?It is the wizardry or corruption!But now it has emerged that Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a known Clinton insider and former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman, deposed at least $675,000 to the election of the wife of an FBI official doing the Clinton investigation. More so, his political action committee gave $467,500 to the state senate campaign for FBI agent Andrew McCabe’s wife. Just to be clear he has the reputation of a deputy director.Via   ThePoliticalInsiderMore money came to her through the Democratic Party of Virginia:Jill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, the report states, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe.The money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate’s husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the FBI.Within a year, McCabe was promoted to deputy director, the second-highest position in the bureau.[…]The governor’s office claimed the FBI’s McCabe met the governor only once — on March 7, 2015, when McAuliffe persuaded Jill McCabe to run.The 2015 Virginia state Senate run — her first run for public office — was unsuccessful as she lost to the incumbent Republican.McAuliffe “supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors… Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous,” a spokesman for the Virginia governor told The Journal.McAuliffe, a long-time D.C. insider, claims that this was simply him supporting fellow Democrats. But McCabe was the third-largest recipient of funds from Common Good VA, the Governor’s PAC. With such few public meetings, the massive size of the contribution is more than a little suspicious.McCabe’s campaign announcement came in March 2015, roughly the same time it was reported that Hillary Clinton illegally used a home email server to transmit classified documents.This is pay-for-play politics at its worse. Hillary Clinton’s team knows how D.C. works, and the Governor of Virginia was willing to do anything to prevent his friend from facing criminal charges. Politics is a dirty business, and there’s no question that McAuliffe was trying to buy favors.

Going all in against the director of the FBI is precarious — especially after Democrats praised his integrity after he initially cleared Hillary Clinton in July.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | J Thomas Gaffney | 83 | 1337636596332589_1337637716332477 | The Democrats and Clinton campaign sensed they were losing the presidential election to Trump so they've devised this scheme to contest the election if they lose, claiming interference too close to the election under provisions of the Hatch Act. And if this doesn’t work, they’ll contest the election claiming Putin and Russia interfered with the U.S. election through Wikileaks. This is all assuming that their massive vote rigging scheme fails to elect Hillary in the first place.
2 | Suzanne Brown | 37 | 1337636596332589_1337662126330036 | I had on a morning show,on MSNBC, but was sickened by the constant harping on the Emails. Dear heaven, do you really want a Trump Presidency. Are your precious ratings more important than the health of this nation. Not one of your reporters in his heart believes Trump is capable of doing the job yet you villify Hillary and make Trump look like a good guy.
3 | George Gonzalez | 51 | 1337636596332589_1337640579665524 | Democrasts are in war with thriers own Corruption ,Hillary time for You to step down, how is posible she's still Runnig for president under a criminal investigation?
4 | Jack Harrington | 20 | 1337636596332589_1337662619663320 | Comey (FBI) is attempting to sabotage HRC's campaign w/ the latest email review. The investigation is not "reopened," the emails on her assistant's laptop are being reviewed and HRC has had nothing to do w/ that. Chaffetz, republican house member hoping to become Speaker of the House SOON, received a note from FBI Comey stating it was a simple review of HRC's assistant's emails. Chaffetz perjured the meaning of the FBI note by immediately going to the media and stating, "The FBI director was 'reopening' the investigation into Hilary Clinton's using personal email server." There is a huge difference between "reviewing" emails on someone else's laptop and "reopening" the investigation that has taken millions of dollars and years to complete. Chaffetz intended to upset the HRC campaign, the white house and all supporters of HRC and to tilt the election in trump's favor. This is treason. Our system really is beginning to crumble right in front of us.
5 | Michael Richmond | 4 | 1337636596332589_1337681919661390 | I believe that we are missing the basic issue. The server has been investigated, it was determined that it was not appropriate but was not criminal. The new issue is that there was a discovery of more emails that may be significant. That discovery could be important  if classified information was sent  What can also be significant if any corespondance would point to a cover up of the destrction of emails/ corespondance. I am a lifelong Democrat and I have no tolerance for any type of cover up or malfeasance. The FBI director was praised and quoted by Mrs. Clinton and other Democrats. He let Congress know, I may have been too quick in my previous testimony. Let us not forget that he was under oath before the Congressional hearing. Let us hope it is nothing but Democrats and Republicans cannot have it both ways.

9 | Clifford Phillips Jr | 6 | 1337636596332589_1337654162997499 | Copy from Facebook page of Kevin M Carney(opposing Views.) A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!Clifford Phillips Jr's Tomahawked
10 | James Ray Amos | 3 | 1337636596332589_1337757922987123 | wishes Director Comey would release some updates on investigations involving Trump, including his Russian connections which might balance his mistaken dumping of innuendoes against Hillary Clinton. Its astonishing that all the issues placed under a republican microscope into Hillary for all these years have not only found nothing but have been proven to just be partisan witch-hunts. None of it makes Trump fit for office or changes the direction the republican policies would take our country. If you're not satisfied with the direction our country is taking, voting for more GOP obstruction doesn't solve that...PEACE!
11 | Josephine Blow | 2 | 1337636596332589_1337960412966874 | Early voting is still going on, and, if it's anything like where I am in Florida, it's insanely busy already.We NEED as many Democrats and lefties as possible to get out and vote straight ticket Democratic as early as possible. You can also get a mail-in vote if you can't wait in line.Remember that we got stuck with Bush in 2000 because 538 fewer Democrats voted. The time to find out we were only short a few hundred votes is NOT the day after the election.I'm talking to you, millennials at the coffeehouse and others "too cool" to vote, you have to vote this time. The consequences are more than you want to pay.And you will pay.

19 | Beverly Godfrey | 0 | 1337636596332589_1338482712914644 | Comey is the head of the FBI and should have had the guts to withstand the harrassment / or threats from the nasty pushy slime ball republicans. It was the republican who released the vague letter when they weren't supposed to and who put the conspiracy spin on itThere may be security reasons he hasn't released info on Trump and the Russians, but he should have been able to release something#hatetobehim
20 | Dawn Knapp | 0 | 1337636596332589_1338283146267934 | Comey sending that letter makes me think of when the World's Fair was going on in Atlanta or was it the Olympics anyhow there was that bombing. Remember the FBI cast aspirations against that one guy. It turned out it wasn't him but it ruined his life. Comey was wrong in making this public. Comey seems to think he's J Edgar Hoover. And if he was afraid of leaks in the FBI , the fact that he can't contain confidential information and the FBI shows that he's not running a very tight ship I would almost say he's careless.

22 | Richard Howell | 0 | 1337636596332589_1337659819663600 | The references to “Metadata” by the cable news outlets are aimed at confusing the computer illiterates, by making them believe that all information is stored and accessible in the “Metadata”, this is far from the truth. In fact, it is a downright lie and the cable news outlet should be held accountable for spreading propaganda to the public through a series of carefully orchestrated Republicans white men lies.To access “Metadata, which is stored in binary form, a separate “.Net” program would have to be written specifically to the process and information required. This means that someone in the FBI’s IT Department wrote a “.Net” program to access and interrogates “Metadata”. Program Specifications had to be developed, design documents had to be developed, and the program had to be coded and compiled into a “Metadata” file and tested. Who are the FBI Technicians that wrote the programs that accessed “Metadata” of the “.Net” programs used in sending and receiving State Department emails? How long did it take to develop the “.Net” program, what were the final testing results?
23 | Mark Rush | 1 | 1337636596332589_1337668122996103 | This FBI do director broke the rules that were in place and played politics with The Office of The FBI and even admitted to it in writing, so yes The Democrats should force his hand. They should keep the pressure on, because this will make the next FBI Director think twice about doing the same think in the future.

2 | Sam William | 47 | 1552029384817086_1552676758085682 | Trump should be investigated for treason for encouraging Russia to interfere with our election...and by the way when is Trump’s racketeering and fraud case is it b4 or after his rape case of 13 yr old girl ,not to mention the 12 women accusing him of sexual assault.
3 | Selena Ellis | 10 | 1552029384817086_1552696188083739 | Obamacare has not tripled,my daughter has used it 2 two years now. She has 0 premiums, Last year she was diagnosed with cancer,she would have died without Obamacare,She paid nothing out of pocket for treatments. During her treatments she continued to attend Culinary School and continued to volunteer with Meal on Wheels, She is cancer free now and will go to work for Meals on Wheels to give back to the community.  Trump will go to trial in December for the rape of a 13 yr old girl. Trump will go to trial on fraud charges for his Trump University.Trump has 12 women he has groped without their permission. Trump faces 169 trial and courts dates Trump has married two immigrants and wishes to build a wall. He is supporting Russia instead of his own country. He hire immigrants to work for him and imports foreign goods for his hotels. He lacks any record of supporting the American people ,With all this you think he will make a good President. The President's job is like hiring any job position, it requires knowledge and experience,Trump has neither, It requires background check,Trump certainly would not pass it.Thus the reason people feel that Trump supporters may be racist and uneducated.
4 | Jennifer Baymon | 3 | 1552029384817086_1553277968025561 | Regardless of what you think and feel about Hillary Clinton and her emails and Benghazi and Bill Clinton cheating on her and her defending him, and whatever else, Donald Trump has, what should be, to decent, respectable people, a fatal flaw: Donald Trump brings out the WORST in people. Period. And that is NOT what a good leader should do. A good leader should bring out the BEST in people.You don't see Hillary Clinton supporters putting Trump lookalike dummies in fake electric chairs on their lawns. You don't see Clinton supporters drawing ethnic hate symbols on their bodies, and waving them around on posters and banners and flags and telling American citizens to go back to "their" country as if this country belongs to them. You don't see Clinton supporters threatening to kill Donald Trump. But Trump supporters do this crap all day everyday to Clinton, her supporters, the media and anyone who opposes Trump.Donald Trump's supporter ARE a basket of deplorables and Hillary Clinton should not have had to apologize for saying that. Trump not only condones this horrific behavior, he encourages it. That alone should disqualify him from being a serious candidate for President of the United States and I just can't wrap my brain around how it doesn't. It's sickening. 😔
5 | Angela Gene | 13 | 1552029384817086_1552661694753855 | Just in case you haven't been keeping up this election season this is where we are Just recap with me for a minute: The former first lady and Presidential candidate, who was pushing for nationalized healthcare; whose premiums just tripled; who stole furniture out of the White House and the State Department; who destabilized Libya, making it a "haven for terrorists"; and runs a non-profit slush fund that traffics money from foreign governments is being reinvestigated by the FBI for the casual dissemination of classified information to her chief of staff because her mayoral candidate husband's electronic devices are also being investigated by the FBI for sexting a fifteen year old, and she's being sold as the experienced candidate and the new leader of the free world by the consolidated news media that has donated to her campaign.
6 | Cecilia St Laurent Toulouse | 1 | 1552029384817086_1552817104738314 | Mr. Hedglin. If you cared to research you would find out most radio and tv stations are actually owned by the 1%. These are the people affiliated with power all over the world and responsible for the TEA PARTY.  The media has treated Hillary very badly; due to her and her husbands resistance  to this particular sect and not allowing them to do as they please with America . The media has allowed all of us to believe she is dishonest, although she has been cleared of everything they have ever accused her of. DONALD TRUMP on the other hand; they are simply repeating what he says. Using his own words. The ALT-RIGHT counts on you to be too busy to check the facts. And obviously you don't.  Use your head; When the KKK supports a candidate there is a reason for it. When BREITBART supports a candidate there is a reason for it. The 4 people closest to Trump have been making theirs life's mission to destroy Hillary.  Think! why are they so afraid of her?

10 | Dean Felix | 1 | 1552029384817086_1552822424737782 | For those of you who wonder why so many of us are voting for Trump- I think this sums it up pretty good! For What It's Worth Department:                                        The Media just doesn’t get it....they can't believe that people are so angry     that they can no longer be manipulated!  Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes, he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phony pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and it's going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.

19 | Gerald Ott | 0 | 1552029384817086_1552711108082247 | Must read b/4 voting. NBC writes  “But Trump's escalation in rhetoric, paired with his longstanding reluctance to denounce extremist supporters, has civil rights groups worried that conditions are becoming dangerous.“This fear is especially pronounced because Trump has cast such a wide net in picking targets, and they often have a racial, ethnic, or religious component. He's regularly made false claims about American Muslims celebrating terrorism or refusing to turn in an attacker and warned that "other communities" — almost invariably cities with large minority populations — are out to steal the election. Recently, Trump told Fox News "illegal immigrants are voting all over the country.""What happens on Nov. 9 is anyone's guess, but some of these trend lines of mainstreaming and broadening bigotry and incidents of violence and hints of a dark conspiracy are very concerning," Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said in an interview.

2 | Jackson Eggers | 226 | 1337554249674157_1337559083007007 | To the liberals and progressives out there. As you can see it is critical now more than ever that you get out and vote. My take on this new FBI investigation is that it is a political hit piece. It's a plot hatched by embarrassed FBI agents looking for revenge and Republicans trying to gain advantage by any means necessary. Think about it, what do the emails the feds have really say? No one knows because they won't release them. So why release a statement saying basically we are investigating, but we won't tell you what our new evidence is or why it is important. This is the kind of justice and government we can look forward to under President Trump with a Republican majority. They will use the power of government to harass and persecute all their enemies, real and imagined. If you want to fight against Trump and his politics of revenge, then you MUST get out and vote blue all the way down the ticket. You can make a difference.

Trump was fined $750,000 by the FTC for failing to disclose his purchases of stock in two companies.The hypocrisy of Trump supporters is too funny and too sad at the same time.
5 | Janay King | 68 | 1337554249674157_1337560673006848 | He has lost his mind!As we run into this final stretch in the 2016 vote, I wanted to make a post that helps to keep people on target since this is such an important election. Let’s think about the recent Brexit vote that is forcing the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, for a moment. In that vote, people made a protest vote against staying in the Union because they didn’t think that it would really happen. The Result, many Millennial Voters desperately want to take their vote back, saying that they were not being serious. In the 1980’s Carter was up by 8 points in the polls, people did not come out to vote because they thought that he had it beat. In the 2000 election, people were not thrilled about Al Gore, thinking that he was too much of a bore, and not a strong candidate. Many Liberals voted for Ralph Nader instead of Al Gore, and handed George Bush Jr. a razor thin victory that resulted in a disastrous 8 years. Listen People, I understand that it really looks like Hillary has this all sewn up. Trust me when I say that she doesn’t. It is not over until the last vote is counted.  She may not be your candidate that you are willing to stand on railroad tracks to get elected, she may not be your perfect choice for President, BUTIf history tells us anything, it is that we should never take anything for granted. This election needs to be won by Hillary Clinton. It is not enough to say that Hillary Needs to be President, but that she needs to win by such a huge margin so we never have to see Trump, or anyone like Trump, on the ballot ever again. We need to retake Congress. We need to vote blue for all Congressmen and Senators so we can retake the House and Senate. We need to put a stop to this crazy Republican right wing insanity that has gripped our government for years because of blind racism and stupidity. Get out there, Vote, get your Friends and Family to vote. Stop the insanity!!!!

9 | Bryan Davis Sr. | 40 | 1337554249674157_1337564819673100 | Trump continues to harp on the one issue that has no real substance with Hillary's email's but Hillary has 101 items to come against Trump with and until election day at her rallies and in the news she needs to constantly remind people that Trump is a child molesting, incest practicing, woman assaulting, abortion punishing, tax evading, handicap bashing, fascist loving, Putin supporting, business destroying, job killing, minority hating racist!!!!! DON'T LET PEOPLE FORGET because he's not letting them forget about those insignificant emails...
10 | Jeff Hollifield | 35 | 1337554249674157_1337561643006751 | Unbelievable, completely unbelievable.

12 | Mera Molano Andrea Esthefania | 35 | 1337554249674157_1337556669673915 | It is critical that we dump Trump✖️👞💩🔚However, at this point, if you’re still a supporter of Donald Trump, here’s what you really are: You’re someone who’s cemented your place in history as an individual who we’re all going to look back upon with disgust and shame because you were ignorant enough to support one of the worst presidential candidates in United States history. This is a man who’s: Mocked a man with disabilities. Attacked the parents of a fallen American hero. Belittled POWs and the war record of Sen. John McCain. Lied about how much money he raised for veterans. Called a former Miss Universe “disgusting” and fat, telling his Twitter followers to find her non-existent sex tape. Accused an American-born federal judge of being unfit to do his job because of his Mexican heritage. Likely avoided paying taxes for nearly two decades. Called most Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, even though that’s not remotely factual. Lied about seeing “thousands and thousands” of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. Lied about getting a letter from the NFL complaining about the debate schedule. Tried to exploit the death of an African American woman in Chicago to say that’s why black voters will support him. Found the “bright side” to tragedies because his poll numbers tend to go up. Settled with the Department of Justice after his company was found guilty of racially discriminating against minorities. Has cheated on at least one wife. Was just discovered on video admitting that he not only tried to cheat on his current wife, but he attempted to do so with another married woman. Had his first wife publicly say that he did nothing when it came to raising their children until they were old enough to talk business. Tweeted that women should have expected to be sexually assaulted when they mixed males and females together in the military. Said he wants to target the families of terrorists. Stated that he wants to ban an entire religion. Praised a Russian president who obviously hates the U.S. and Americans. Encouraged the Russian government to commit espionage against Americans. Insinuated that another Republican’s wife was ugly. Tried to implicate another Republican’s father in JFK’s assassination. Sought out the help of former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes after he was fired following multiple allegations that he had sexually harassed women for years. Made Breitbart’s Steve Bannon one of his top campaign people. Had a former campaign manager abruptly resign after a report came out linking him to pro-Russian groups that were directly trying to undermine U.S. policy in eastern Europe. Called Carly Fiornia ugly. Has said climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese — then denied saying it. Was a leading conspiracy theorist when it came to the racist-driven birther conspiracies against President Obama. Dismissed nearly eight years of accusing the president of not being an American with a less than 30 second statement where he didn’t apologize for any of it. Tried to blame Hillary Clinton for his racism. Re-tweeted anti-African American propaganda created by a white supremacy group. Played dumb about knowing who former Grand Wizard of the KKK David Duke was. Skipped a presidential debate because he was scared of a moderator. Has, on several occasions, suggested he finds his daughter attractive. Called a husband doing things like changing diapers and helping with the children, a man “trying to be the wife.” Has said he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. Said he can’t release his tax returns because they’re currently being audited — even though the IRS said that’s a lie. Feels he has the right to sexually assault women.!!!!!!!!!

What kind of laptop is this with  this extraordinary large  hard drive?  How did the FBI obtain a supposedly, classified laptop, investigating her husband want fly. They must have been very small one line emails. Also, he said, what would happened if it was found that Hillary had a smoking gun incident about emails and other bull after the election. What about Donald Trump, suppose, after the election it is found that he has had sex with over 20 more females, and some may have been even under age, as, rumored. Are you going to allow him to stay in office, hiding behind Bill Clinton. Hugh Hewitt is one big liar.

I’m building a wall.” GOP nominee Donald Trump argued that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel should recuse himself from cases involving scandal-plagued Trump University. Trump insisted Curiel’s ethnicity means he can’t be an impartial judge in matters involving him because of his immigration policy.“I've had terrible rulings, I've been treated very unfairly. Now, this judge is of Mexican heritage,” Trump began. “I’m building a wall. I’m building a wall.”

Mika and Joe is cartoon charters and Mika talkiping about open invitation, she don't even know how to conduct an interview without Joe and he can't interview, they are both sad. Mika is the biggest sell out of the Democrat party, they both slobbering over Trump.Mika is like an echo chamber, she sit their like a zombie and MSNBC pay her, they need to recoup their money. Democrats shouldn't go on the show
25 | Jeff Butts | 3 | 1337554249674157_1337579856338263 | So Hillary having Huma as her personal asst is nothing?

Yeah look which party are the racists! Democrats are hypocrites and the cancer in this country.

Pence defended Comey's decision to notify Congress of the potentially new batch of emails despite top DOJ officials arguing such disclosure of information that lacks substantive detail is not a standing practice, particularly when it could influence an election.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Cheryl Stolle | 205 | 1337534216342827_1337540093008906 | How about revealing info about the FBI investigations of Trump, and the rape allegations. Trump has no business calling anyone other than himself a perv. He is the very definition of the term.
2 | Amara Belle Barksdale | 202 | 1337534216342827_1337536806342568 | Well of course he would defend it, this is a blatant political ploy. But what about trumps skeletons Lola such hypocrites. Now I'm going to make sure I vote on the 8 this is a dirty way to get votes.
3 | Lisa Gobeli | 124 | 1337534216342827_1337548066341442 | Hey Pence how about your orange boy release ALL of his tax returns....oh that's right, he has nothing to hide. Hypocrite and bigly!!!
4 | Jessica Naomi | 98 | 1337534216342827_1337537609675821 | Figures Feckless Pence would do that but what is NBC excuse for refusing to release Deplorable Donald racist sexist Apprentice tapes rants what are YOU hiding Chuck Todd?
5 | Jacqueline Parkey | 53 | 1337534216342827_1337550463007869 | Bwahahahaha says the candidates that keep tax returns secret, has two politicalOperatives that has to leave campaign overnight bc of Russian Kremlin ties , so in debt to Chinese and Russian banks, has a trump U racketeering trial in Nov, a child rape case in Dec, currently named (as always, so it has nothing to do with bringing him down) in double digit law suits bc he won't pay his bills, is under FBI investigation for working with Russia to interfere with US elections, double digit sexually assaulted women coming forward after he lied on national tv that he never does  it, asked his campaign staff what a Gold Star family was, and had to cease and desist his illegal charity... you know, the one that he took donations from others and used it for paintings of himself, to pay his legal fees for some of his nearly 4,000 lawsuits against him-some for sexual harassment spanning decades, and a fountain for one of his golf courses. I think Mike Pence should stfu so ppl don't start talking about how republicans in his state refused to reelect him as their governor. He was just that bad.
6 | Eva Capaldi | 52 | 1337534216342827_1337539993008916 | It was just clearly stated on the morning news that the FBI director himself doesn't even know if these emails are significant so if he didn't know they were significant he should've never have said anything until he review them he is getting a lot of heat right now because he has strong something else there and he has no details I know that anything is even significant
7 | Imogene Aldridge Hall | 31 | 1337534216342827_1337534933009422 | Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin brought this all on themselves. It wouldn't be happening 8 days before an election if the two of them had not lied and destroyed/hid evidence.
8 | Thomas Huntley | 15 | 1337534216342827_1337540446342204 | Hillary's supporters still back her and DT's supporters still back him. This changes nothing. Just high drama to fill the cable news talk shows for the next week #hurryupnovember9
9 | Ken Myers | 13 | 1337534216342827_1337594766336772 | Just remember: Trump will go on trial in November for accused Racketeering, and again in December accused of child rape. He is a sexual predator, and hasn't released his tax returns, and has used his foundation money to pay his legal fees. So instead lets talk about emails Hillary did not send from someone else's computer. Come on America lets focus. The whole Trump campaign is to get you confused and apathetic, if you stay home you get Trump. The release is timed to save House and Senate members, that is why they released tweets before the letter was received. We must do one thing above all else. That is make sure another Trump never even tries again we must leave no doubt.
10 | Anna Shive | 16 | 1337534216342827_1337586096337639 | These men disgust me. Let's see all your emails for a change. Your man Trump has not released anything. I don't give a Damm about the emails. I will vote Hillary no matter what.
11 | Gwendolyn Robertson | 5 | 1337534216342827_1337644799665102 | Six-Pence would say that, because he's a Trumpster-clone with no morals. No one bothered to wait until anything was found, and once Comey made that decision to attack the e-mails, Comey stepped over the line to sway the vote to one candidate against the other. He should be fired. And Trumpster, who didn't wait for a decision, he jumps on his high horse and spews his venom. Now they ALL have EGG on THEIR FACES! Self-serving bunch of hypocrites.
12 | Ali Bomaye | 29 | 1337534216342827_1337539049675677 | We know Trump is racist, rapist and Russian puppet. That is why he won't release his Tax returns. No wonder they want to distract us with Hillary's emails. Even Wikileaks & Russians couldn't find a smoking gun.
13 | Nancy Chavira | 11 | 1337534216342827_1337558766340372 | Remember way back when the republicans said there would be a bombshell coming in October, they knew, don't be fooled! They are just as crooked.
14 | Joshua Sickles | 7 | 1337534216342827_1337552269674355 | A vote for Hillary might very well end up being a vote for Kaine.  So liberals have seen proof that the DNC conspired against their beloved Bernie. They know she has lied to the FBI and the American people. They know she deleted classified emails that was never supposed to of been on the server they was on and before you say they was personal emails just don't, no one goes through the expensive process of bleaching their server to hide non criminal emails it's just common sense. She let Americans die in Benghazi.  She takes money from countries that kills GAYS.  Has anyone heard her condem these countries?  Nope she takes their dirty money.  Then their is wiki leaks but all democrats will say that those emails are made up and not authentic.  Even our own military and police do not support her. If our nations heros don't support her but you do then you might be part of the liberal problem in America. A bunch of easily offended sissy's who want the government to tax the rich more because they can't figure out how to make it on their own without having the government steal it from someone and then give it to you.  Then there is obama care and the disaster that is. She says she wants to fix it.... No you can't fix it or you would of already did it so you can look forward to crazy high premiums that no one can afford.
15 | Raksha Andreassen | 4 | 1337534216342827_1337612293001686 | Your coverage of emails found on Huma Abedin's husband's computer sucks! You fail to mention that FBI knew about the emails while ago and yet they didn't investigate the emails or notify Comey who was stupid to disclose that information 11 days before the election. For all I know these emails were - looked at already - are duplicates- could have been altered by a rogue, right wing FBI agent- or they have nothing to do with Hillary's personal serverMy vote for Hillary remains solid!!!
16 | John Wilson | 7 | 1337534216342827_1337540583008857 | It was not really a surprise,people sort of expected that the 30thousand email would show up, but  we didn't expect it would be the FBI not wikileaks. It really shouldn't have an impact. There are two kind of voters, ones that know she is corrupt and one that knows she is corrupt and will still vote for her.

Executive branch personnel, except for the President and Vice President, can not take part in any action to influence the outcome of any election.  I bet we see a resignation before Jan 20. Either candidate can not trust him to serve in their administration
20 | Denzil P Walker | 5 | 1337534216342827_1337551466341102 | No matter the personal advantage, at some point in time, some person has to see that Director Comey overstepped his partiality. To sit there, and not acknowledge that, shows the colors of this hypocrite who loves to say, "I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican" in that order. As is often the case, those who love to get on their soapboxes and declare their selective Christianity, are some of the worst hypocrites of whom Christ warned us in his teachings.
21 | Joseph James Mohn | 3 | 1337534216342827_1337564649673117 | Of course the DOJ was against it. They've been protecting Hillary since day 1. Loreta Lynch's secret meeting with Bill Clinton just enforces that known fact.
22 | Al Snook | 0 | 1337534216342827_1337715296324719 | As typical with Dangerous Donald, he claims that his opponent's are doing bad  things that he himself is doing or has done in the past. A bit of the old pot & kettle story.Hillary is a lier ....Dangerous Donald has been caught & verified in many, many lies to the American Public. Hillary is dishonest. ...... Dangerous Donald is being sued for fraud and has been shown to not honor his contracts. Hillary is secretive. ..... Dangerous Donald will not show ANY tax returns, it's non of the People's business. The election is rigged. ..... this latest FBI release may have been orchestrated by the Republicans to do exactly that. On a state & local level the Republicans have been trying to suppress voter registration & turn out. When one looks at Dangerous Donald, it's plainly evident that whatever he claims is bad about Hillary, he, Dangerous Donald, has already participated in similar activities.
23 | Joshua Feind | 1 | 1337534216342827_1337628883000027 | A ****ing never ending circle. When this does not pan out, which it won't, they'll choose another aquaintence or friend of the Clintons and demand their emails. Nothing new and more tax payers money all to beat a dead horse.
24 | Christine Campbell | 1 | 1337534216342827_1337722916323957 | Pence preaches that no one is above the law (Hillary), but it seems to be okay with him that Comey skirts the law.   I guess if it benefits his and his nitwit co-runner's campaign then, hey, let's just massage that law to our liking.
25 | Dale Whiting | 2 | 1337534216342827_1337551263007789 | No need for such a demand, Mr Pence. Two days after making his Hatch Act violating statement, Comey got his warrant! The Hatch Act mandated he keep silent until he got that warrant, used it to investigate any possible relevance, then make that release.
