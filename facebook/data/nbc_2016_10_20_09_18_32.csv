Here are the five major takeaways from the final debate between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kevin L. Rivadeneira | 1540648029288555_1540649612621730 | She won, he lost, just please go vote people and don't be complacent !  The cheeto groper in chief is not even a good candidate... shame on the GOP for this one man jerk circus... thank God this is almost over!!! Go Vote and vote blue all the way!
2 | Damon L. Priddy | 1540648029288555_1540649195955105 | ... and the sixth takeaway... Hillary announces to the world our nuclear response time!!!!! I would think that's classified... not anymore!!
3 | Annie McNew | 1540648029288555_1540657662620925 | So tired of the media trying to control this circus of election. I could give a rats a@@ what the media gets out of anything.  You seriously have ZERO influence on my educated and intelligent being.
4 | Richard Main | 1540648029288555_1540669862619705 | Hillary's 'plan' in a nutshell: tax the rich. Great plan. Been going on for decades. The rich pay a higher percentage rate than any other tax bracket in america, and our corporate tax is one of the highest in the world. She says that she wants americans to be successful, but if you do become successful, her plan is to punish you for doing so. No wonder everyone is taking their business elsewhere, and more and more people are just giving up and not trying to succeed. Just claim you can't make it, and get your free handout.
5 | Andrew Doerring | 1540648029288555_1540649545955070 | She is NASTY. Anyone that thinks it's OK to dismember a child the day before birth is NASTY. Anyone that lets four Americans die overseas for political gain is NASTY. Anyone that blames a twelve year old girl for getting raped is NASTY. Anyone that takes millions of dollars from enemies of America is NASTY. Anyone that steals billions of dollars from a nation that was totally destroyed by an earthquake is NASTY. Anyone that has no problem lying to millions of people every time she opens her mouth is NASTY. NASTY SOUL.
6 | Denise Marano Nadel | 1540648029288555_1540662052620486 | All opinion in your fact checking. We know who's side you are on. She is a lying crook with big business interests and a open pocket for donations.
7 | Timothy Vandyk | 1540648029288555_1540650825954942 | The message was clear last night. If you are hoping for a weakening of the status and respect of the United States on the world stage, and a continued assault on the Constitution of this great country, you‚Äôll get what you wish for with Hillary.
8 | Rickie Prichard | 1540648029288555_1540677512618940 | The Never Bash Clinton network is rolling full steam this morning. I have about 6 different major news networks that show up on my page, you guys are hands down the most aggressive this morning...... It's just too bad it's not unbiased journalism.
9 | Steve May | 1540648029288555_1540681695951855 | there is another takeaway from this and that is Anderson Cooper is a baiter against Donald Trump. Ever if Trump wanted to talk about issues Cooper wouldnt leave him alone with his bs about something that happened 11 yrs ago. lets talk about Coopers sex life for a minute with his un-natural perverted physical urges. is he the pitcher or the catcher ? Anderson Cooper did u try to grope the news paper boy when he delivered papers on his bycyle? Cooper u wernt always this squeaky clean queen that u act like now. Where were u 11 years ago? we can only imagine
10 | Mike Herod | 1540648029288555_1540650355954989 | Hilary is declared to be incompetent with national security rather than a criminal by the FBI, a few hours after bill and Loretta meet secretly. Hilarys sheep accept this con willingly but draw the line at rigging elections. Heh! Sheep –Ø Stupidüòú
11 | Idika Osu Uduma Kalu | 1540648029288555_1540661725953852 | How are these the 5 takeaways they chose?! Trump was inept as ever but Hillary point blank ignored questions around corruption and collusion brought about by Wikileaks? Did no one else see that?
12 | Mark Majeski | 1540648029288555_1540651899288168 | The real 5 takeaways from the debate:1. Hillary Still Lies2. Hillary won't admit Pay for Play as Sec of State3. Hillary avoids explaing the deleting of 33,000 emails4. NBC and the Liberal Media still supports the Clintons5. Chris Wallace did a Great Job
13 | Angel Young | 1540648029288555_1540657602620931 | Trump won this debate on substance alone. Clinton has had 30 years to do something and she has done nothing. She destroyed government documents after she received a subpoena and during the debate she gave the entire world the response time to nuclear codes. Clinton cannot be trusted.
14 | Matthew Leach | 1540648029288555_1540673952619296 | No one has any respect for her, and they don't want her working her dirty backroom deals that throw countries into war, like what's happening in the Middle East. The world wants trump to take the presidency because they can trust he's willing to work to make a deal, instead of undermining other countries governing process like Hillary has done.We can't trust our top cop, our top prosecutor or any one in the Obama administration. We can't even trust the media, they're working to manipulate the American public and push democrat party government propaganda.Hillary is corrupt and all she does is put a spin on questions she asked with out answering or being forced to answer.This is no longer an election. This is a push to get corruption and democratic party feel good policies that have created generations of weak entitled useful idiots out of Washington.This is a constitutional republic not a majority rule government. I see dark times ahead if Hillary and big globalist are allowed to steal this election from the American people.
15 | Memory Tyson | 1540648029288555_1540673429286015 | He is a liar,his mouth is foul, he is disrespectful, narsactic, He has no substance, he does not care for anyone,he couldn't or wouldn't answer any questions...he just said she she she and President Obama...dude President Obama has nothing to do with this debate... at 1 point he called her a nasty women... all he can say is I'm gonna fix America...he has not told us how he is gonna fix America... This is a business man who has filed bankruptcy numerous times..how in the hell is this business man gonna make America right when you caint hold your own businesses down? How are you gonna make America right?? How do you expect for women and Hispanics and black people to respect you when you always have something hideous to say about them as if this country has only  1 type of race.... We are a rainbow of people living in America the land of the free.... Hilliary does not seem to be much better..she has lied about many things but 1 thing for sure she is not standing around degrading people like she is God and there is no other... These are the worst 2 candidates that has ever ran for the Presidency while i was old enough to vote...this is just my opinion...
16 | Dan Mac Gilvray | 1540648029288555_1540651569288201 | Here is the six------Can the news media ask why the Clinton Campaign is not talking to Fox news this morning and last night while the campaign people are speaking to other news outlets although it was a Fox new person who mediated the Debate last night. The Clinton Campaign is not allowing interviews to Fox News personnel after the debate.This should be a BIG news story-
17 | John Shirley | 1540648029288555_1540672745952750 | I think Hillary's performance as Dr. Evil on Austin Powers movie deserves at least one huge laugh. Thanks to her, I'm going to watch movie on Netflix.
18 | Ashley Akari | 1540648029288555_1540679552618736 | Clintons think they are above the law. No matter how corrupt they are and put our nation at risk but still standing and even run for president is amazing. That's show me our government  is corrupt too. I still dont get why people vote for them just because of gender and race issue rather than for the country.
19 | April Delalo | 1540648029288555_1540651142621577 | I hate Hillary with a passion, but at least she was prepared, nuanced and coherent last night. Trump was like watching a kid try to fake his way through a book report for a book he never read.
20 | Abdesalam Shiqmujib | 1540648029288555_1540675602619131 | Till a man become mad the family will not has enough loughing ! This is African proverb. Now trump became mad and did his madness last night's debate. After he put a suspicion on American democracy !
21 | Thelma Stephen | 1540648029288555_1540659159287442 | maybe the great TRUMp  planted his mole there in Hillary base to cause disruption there , that is what make him confident in winning the elections.....the guy that cause the attacks, i just think he is from the other side.....think of it guys.
22 | Debra Derrick | 1540648029288555_1540689069284451 | What our law says Hillary should not be able to be in office. Here read this: For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here‚Äôs what it says:‚Äù(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.‚Äù
23 | Maya G Mathew | 1540648029288555_1540661085953916 | I watched with interest but some of the issues had been discussed at last debates....nothing conclusive on both sides....üòÉ
24 | Larry Martin | 1540648029288555_1540674869285871 | The moderator said before the debate: "one of these 2 candidates will be the next president". That is just wrong. If he had said "likely" or "probably", OK. But to pronounce as fact that only Hillary or Donald can possibly win is completely misleading & false.
25 | Darlene Shelley | 1540648029288555_1540652149288143 | HYPOCRITES! Same Democrats Demanding Trump Preemptively Accept Election Results Urged Gore to Challenge Them in 2000BREAKING NEWS BY TRUTHFEEDNEWS OCTOBER 20, 2016The mainstream media‚Äôs latest orchestrated ‚Äúattack‚Äù on Trump is that it is ‚Äúun-American‚Äù and ‚Äúhorrifying‚Äù that he may not accept election results. Like a brainless group of minions, they are all repeating the same talking points.Trump-refuses-election-resultsHorrifying! Trump ‚Äúupends a basic pillar of American democracy‚Äù by saying he will wait and see what happens on election day, because of his concern about voter fraud.But wait! Who was the last candidate who refused to accept the result on election day, as certified by election authorities? Al Gore. Did Gore ‚Äúupend a basic pillar of American democracy‚Äù when he tried to overturn the result of the 2000 election?I don‚Äôt remember the Associated Press saying so at the time. In fact, I would bet that the authors of this piece of AP hysteria were rooting for Gore, at the time. Unbelievable.

She eventually got to know Scalia's "personal good side"
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Trevor Jade Knaphus | 1540630955956929_1540635922623099 | Sick twisted democrats. Offended by everything when it fits their rhetoric, but have no problem being violent or disgusting (madonas BJs for hillarys vote) when they see fit. Hypocrites.
2 | Ginger Alyson | 1540630955956929_1540658279287530 | Are ya'll really bashing a dead man?I understand bashing Saddam or Bin Laden or Hitler...but seriously? This should have been done while he was alive so he had the opportunity to defend himself. This is disgusting behavior, NBC.
3 | Trevor Jade Knaphus | 1540630955956929_1540636435956381 | I'm voting for Donald Trump. No failed and resigned secretary of state should get a promotion to president. She couldn't even handle that job.
4 | Craig J. Doucette | 1540630955956929_1540685125951512 | Democrats showing their violent side. My god if you respect life and the rule of law, freedom and personal responsibility you are their enemy.
5 | John Matthews | 1540630955956929_1540682072618484 | Disgusting woman. Can you imagine if a male Supreme Court justice talked about bashing one of the women with a baseball bat? We would never hear the end of it. Not to mention that he can not respond. You going to go and talk about bashing Reagan with a bat next B**ch? You are a disgrace to this country. You should be removed!!
6 | Zachary Stinson | 1540630955956929_1540636085956416 | She wanted to hit him with a bat because he wouldn't let her burn the constitution.
7 | Theodore R. Wade Jr. | 1540630955956929_1540636439289714 | The funny thing about Scalia is,being a southern Italian, he is blacker than Obama.
8 | Sonia Mahtani- Manisha Nandwani | 1540630955956929_1540645045955520 | Scalia the scumRump and his basket of deplorables
9 | Steve Thames | 1540630955956929_1540684639284894 | Typical Hillary Hitler Regime response! Hate and violence before common sense!
10 | Steve Pollack | 1540630955956929_1540674909285867 | House Just Passed The Donald Trump Act, Sends HUGE Message To Obama And Hillary...http://americannews.com/house-just-passed-the-donald-trump-act-sends-huge-message-to-obama-and-hillary/
11 | Darlene Shelley | 1540630955956929_1540634049289953 | Well that's nice but you don't want to get in hillary's way.
12 | Tony Estanislao | 1540630955956929_1540670809286277 | Democrats had him killed wikileaks email high light a term used in HITS like the mafia between Clinton staffers
13 | Terri Arana | 1540630955956929_1540685002618191 | As a Puerto Rican myself I feel that she is the most disgusting woman in the Supreme Court.  The Democrats wants divide us American(black Latinos and now Muslims )using the racist card for their political games.
14 | Susan Jean | 1540630955956929_1540647089288649 | Hillary gave away a security secret. She said the Potus has only 4 minutes to make a decision about releasing the nuclear bomb!
15 | Jase Andrew | 1540630955956929_1540671652619526 | We need more justices like scalia the only justice that obeys the law
16 | Crystal LaLone | 1540630955956929_1540635742623117 | Disgusting cow

18 | Tony Pascone | 1540630955956929_1540644685955556 | so she advocates violence against men?  she obviously wasn't being serious, but if trump said something like this, how quickly would people lose their minds?  i expect to see massive outrage any minute now
19 | Doug Lambert | 1540630955956929_1540671589286199 | And this is newsworthy because......
20 | M J Martinez Crogan | 1540630955956929_1540650249288333 | Scalia....good phucking riddance

Donald J. Trump still says he "should've gotten" an Emmy Award for his TV show The Apprentice.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Bill Gamelli | 1540621582624533_1540625835957441 | Just another example of his narcissist nature. He's into everything for his own glorification. People actually think he cares about them!  HA!  If he ever became President, that wouldn't be enough. He would want to be crowned Emperor.
2 | Bridget Sullivan | 1540621582624533_1540624629290895 | Oh for the love! He really needs to get off the cross, build a bridge, and get over it. So, he didn't win an Emmy, big deal. A lot of deserving shows have never won, much less been nominated for, an Emmy. Don't see the creators, actors, grips, etc complaining about that years after the fact.
3 | Charlene Palmer | 1540621582624533_1540630795956945 | Ugh, can't stand a person that's so arrogant and thinks he's better than everyone. Trump supporters have done nothing but try to bully me into voting for him. It will never happen. They have lost all respect for fellow citizens.
4 | Hope TR | 1540621582624533_1540624925957532 | ..and Hillary should be checked by a doctor, her face looked pasty and plastic like, too much make up to hold her up. This woman is sooooo sick, and these Dems are covering it up.
5 | Stacey Lynn Franklin | 1540621582624533_1540626475957377 | I don't support either. But it's very clear who NBC supports, and I don't get that. I never see any reports or posts about what all she has done, and it's alot!! How can people ignore that? Just curious.
6 | Allan Cohen | 1540621582624533_1540674732619218 | I do not care if Donald Trump called a woman fat. I do not care if he tried to sleep with a woman or if he likes "beautiful" women. I care that he sent a plane to pick up 200 Marines who were stranded after desert storm. I care that he supports our police officers and first responders. I care that he supports guns and standing behind our military. I care that he supports the death penalty and is AGAINST abortion. I care that he supports enforcing immigration laws. I care that he wants to destroy radical Islamic groups. I care that he supports COAL. These are things I care about. Him talking sexually about women does not bother me. Were they mean words? Yes. Were they words spoken in PRIVATE? Yes. Have you ever talked to your friends about the opposite sex in private and said things? I'm positive all of you have. But, News Flash!! Women have been sexualized for centuries!! Jay-Z, Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne and every single other rapper helped establish that platform, but people are ok with music blasted all over the radio degrading women. Ever heard of Victoria Secret? Or their fashion show? Ever heard of Hooters? People are ok with that too. Until all of these things are different, women will be viewed this way. Your precious Obama couldn't change that and Hillary can't either. I feel sorry for the women Donald has belittled and said terrible things about. But I'm still much more offended by what Hillary Clinton has DONE over what Donald Trump has SAID... PERIOD!!!! So Trump doesn't do well at the debates, maybe he even sounds childish and incapable. But he is speaking the truth! Just because he's not a polished politician like Hilary or Obama doesn't mean he's unqualified to be president. He cares for this country, not growing the size of his pockets. That man has so much money he could never spend it all. He gets NOTHING out of being president! I'm standing for the man accused of saying mean words. I'll never back a woman under three different scandal investigations, possible murder at Benghazi, and the secretive email scandal which has been nothing but lies from the beginning. Trump 2016!!!Copy and paste!
7 | Billy D'Antoni | 1540621582624533_1540687202617971 | Just another example of NBC shielding Hillarys lies and corruption by making a stupid story out of nothing. The people want to know why Hillary is still free and why she hasn't been disqualified for all the violations of federal law she is guilty of  NBC. That is what is called relevant news NBC. Now go and do your job for once
8 | Elaine Barnett Morgan | 1540621582624533_1540651325954892 | It doesn't matter he's telling the truth. The NBC news lies I see that now after debates last night. I'm so disappointed in you news NBC. I wasn't for nobody for sure not now I know. Rump was right about the the election being rigged.
9 | Dayton Middlebrook | 1540621582624533_1540636585956366 | What if the leaders of the world don't agree on nothing Donald Trump says if he's president what he's going to do get mad and bomb them throwing Tantrums because you haven't won anything is not the way to be if you're running for president.
10 | Alisia Jimenez Gonzales | 1540621582624533_1540650409288317 | My goodness, people! He was just being sarcastic! and playing along with ole Hillary. NBC,don't waste your time dissecting every word he says. there is more to life than that.
11 | Susan Quinn | 1540621582624533_1540689502617741 | The Emmy people had better watch out! Donnie is mad because they didn't give him an Emmy. If elected president, he may throw one of his Trumptantrum and nuke their office!
12 | Jim Baker | 1540621582624533_1540622102624481 | I will never forget the smiling face of the pantsuit Don when Trump brought up the video proving Democratic officials PAID hit men to incite violence at political rallies. That is text book organized crime.
13 | Ernest Goodwyn | 1540621582624533_1540634579289900 | Sorry Trump, Apprentice was good but no one was messing with The Amazing Race its first few seasons on the air. Get over yourself.Waiting for Trumpsters to be like "He was joking! God, learn how to take a joke libtards!". Lol
14 | Barry Williams | 1540621582624533_1540677629285595 | I wonder how long he'll hold on to this loss...You know folx, its been awhile, a long time. How long? Very long. And you know how bigly I wanted to be president. But its been awhile now. And I was winning. I was winning bigly and the media took it away from me...
15 | Debbi Meyers | 1540621582624533_1540643415955683 | NBC really? This is your take away from the entire debate last night? Absolutely ridiculous! Crooked Hillary is the one that brought this up not Trump. I hardly doubt this is high on his priority list right now. Corrupt biased media!
16 | Thomas Mannion | 1540621582624533_1540634985956526 | The guy who took 5 deferments to get out of serving our country while skating through the best schools that money could buy with no distinctions or honors and being given millions of dollars by his dad to start his business where he screwed over thousands of people by reneging on paying him what he owed them...insists everything is "rigged" against him.
17 | Lex Morningstar | 1540621582624533_1540638015956223 | When he said he should of won the emmy i was no more good. That was sooo funny.i don't  take him serious anyway so everything he says its funny. Very entertaining,  if you vote for him the jokes on you
18 | Rickie Prichard | 1540621582624533_1540676949285663 | The Never Bash Clinton network is rolling full steam this morning. I have about 6 different major news networks that show up on my page, you guys are hands down the most aggressive this morning...... It's just too bad it's not unbiased journalism.
19 | Abdesalam Shiqmujib | 1540621582624533_1540657479287610 | Till a man become mad the family will not has enough loughing ! This is African proverb. Now trump became mad and did his madness last night's debate. After he put a suspicion on American democracy !
20 | Becky Swinney | 1540621582624533_1540657062620985 | He is paranoid. He thinks everything is "rigged" against him. he just can't accept that he isn't as great as he thinks he is. He needs to open those squinty eyes and look at reality.
21 | Bradina Benson | 1540621582624533_1540643799288978 | so todays news is he said he wouldnt say for sure if he would accept results, and you say IT DISQUALIFIES HIM TO RUN, OM GOODNESS, SHE HAS STOLE, CHEATED, LIED AND MORE and trump who has never ran for nothing, and is not seasoned is condemned really, how unreal, did you all not see her rudeness, she wouldnt even follow directions. over and over. but he is unfit, wow, you media amazed me, spin it guys spin it. I pray we all prove you guys wrong, as a democrat voting for Trump I now know for sure I am making the right choice. SHE IS EVIL A LIAR AND A CHEAT AND YOU ALL WONT EVEN SHOW IT, there is no free press for sure, the free america is gone.
22 | David Dawson | 1540621582624533_1540679382618753 | Now that's funny. A guy makes a statement and that makes him bitter. You guys are a riot. It's been fun watching your reporting and your integrity go down the tubes.
23 | Shelli Lynn | 1540621582624533_1540624412624250 | The media is so  biased it's sick. Hillary is a criminal, liar and where is the news all over how horrible Trump is...
24 | Steven Allen Ritnour | 1540621582624533_1540647375955287 | One set for the rich and powerful political class.One set for the unconnected powerless people.Laws that would lock me up for 20 years are just an insignificant annoyance to government operatives.This is my #1 issue when I enter the voting booth.Who is more likely to clean up the corruption?
25 | Ahmed Ali | 1540621582624533_1540642692622422 | The only problem is that when Trump knows no lying or deception ... The only thing that excel where Hillary is lying and deception .......... we are in a time of lying sincere and true liar ....... and, unfortunately, some people love them of lying and deceiving them. ....... Shortcut to this story this woman Hillary crow gaffer lost their way and no choice but to lie to bring it up to anything she is a woman very serious even on itself and will destroy everything is a woman unbalanced mind to have the evil and hatred that is the world burn unfortunate that this presidential candidate is pray that the American people, of which she is a woman ruthless disaster

It was a stunning moment, even in this election campaign.

1 | Muhammad Bilal Bhatti | 1540584755961549_1540584989294859 | Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."No I did not write this, its a share of a share of share, I don't take any credit but I thought it was to hilarious that it deserved to be reshared.
2 | Enrique Melendez | 1540584755961549_1540586782628013 | It is all tape and video. But Trump supporters don't believe in facts,logic and science.
3 | Dan Sullivan | 1540584755961549_1540588695961155 | yeah, rewound it to see what it was to cause him to say that "nasty woman" bit. And his people said he scored a knockout. If they meant he knocked out his own chances, they're right.
4 | N Minh Nguyen | 1540584755961549_1540591882627503 | Not only will he lose the election, but he will lose his so call empire....this is the karma millions of people he has cheated, swindled, raped and groped them out of their integirty, livelihood, and self-worth.
5 | Kimberly Ann Simmons | 1540584755961549_1540591729294185 | And in her response "that's horrifying"The ONLY thing that is horrifying is that we have a criminal who is allowed to run for office in the US. Now that is HORRIFYING!!!
6 | Keith Warren | 1540584755961549_1540590632627628 | His own words have harmed his campaign since day one.  He complains about media bias but keeps feeding them ammunition at the same time.  He probably could have not said a single word once he was nominated and won.
7 | Gina McNeil | 1540584755961549_1540595942627097 | Nothing he says will mater to those people... not when he offended veterans, gold star families, the disabled... as long as he keeps hating on women and minorities they will support him. It doesn't matter who he hurts, what lies he is caught in or who he has defrauded... as long as he acts like a petulant child and talks down about women and minorities.
8 | Paul Ruehs | 1540584755961549_1540594492627242 | Trump's ambiguity about accepting the election results should scare everyone. He (and anyone supporting him) should read the U.S. Constitution and what it mandates regarding the transfer of power. It's worth noting that over the past ten years there have been less than 40 cases of known election fraud (out of one billion votes cast). This amounts to less than .0001 per cent. However, the instances of preventing people from voting or making it unduly difficult, has been on the rise. This is where the real voter fraud lies.
9 | Elizabeth Michel | 1540584755961549_1540612889292069 | I think he has some sort of mental illness....bc he says things and then days later declares 'wrong,' 'I never said those things.' When in fact, yes, he did! And I think he truly believes he never said it!! #neverTrump
10 | Laura Morrison | 1540584755961549_1540592379294120 | Benghazi. thousands of deleted emails. Lying to the FBI and to the American people more times than can be counted. Bizarre health episodes. She defended a man who raped a 12 year old girl, and she laughed about it!!!! These things should dominate the news. Yes, the tape that came out of Trump talking on the bus was disgusting. We are all in agreement on that. Why does HRC get a pass when many of the things she's done are beyond terrible???#TomHoefling2016
11 | Lorraine Miles | 1540584755961549_1540603329293025 | I'm so proud of her, she stood up to a big bully, one who have a deficit with women. I'm even more proud of her tonite for letting each and every bully out there knows, that a woman of substance, intelligence, composure, stamina, and resistance will take you down by diplomacy. Thumbs up and more respect to you Hillary Clinton the next president of the United States of America.
12 | Deb Smith | 1540584755961549_1540587669294591 | Ridiculous. Trump clearly had his best debate of the campaign. Hillary was left trying to recall memorized lines, in a static, monotone voice. Trump was full of fire and passion. Shoot, CNN's own focus group had 10 for Trump and five for Hillary. That was a little embarrassing for them I'm sure.
13 | Robert L Wells | 1540584755961549_1540596655960359 | Tell me something Hillary, Trump has campaigned for the presidency because he wants to make America Great in so many areas: jobs, trade, immigration, America First, stronger defense, take care of our vets, help the people in the inner cities, reestablish law and order, support our law enforcement officers, repeal and replace Obamacare, eliminate ISIS, remove common core, bring education management and control to the local level instead of from DC, reduce taxes for small business and large corporations, flatten our income tax and make it simpler, peace thru strength, give the religious minister's and other religious leaders their freedom of speech and repeal the Johnson Amendment, streamline our government and remove the corruption, preserve our 2nd Amendment rights, appoint conservative constitutional judges, strengthen our borders and eliminate sanctuary cities, and yet after 30 years in politics, I still don't have a clue what the hell you are running for except stronger together whatever the hell that means!
14 | Jim Hawkins | 1540584755961549_1540594809293877 | NBC is so for Hillary its not funny, they are spoon feeding the American public what they (NBC) wants them to hear. The Media makes the news that they want us to hear, and they blow it out of control.
15 | Alain Lambert | 1540584755961549_1540595932627098 | By this action, Trump has spitted on the american flag, and deny the safeties included in the constitution of the USA. Trump is dangerous, and a shameful error in potus candidat history. #unpatriotic #debate
16 | Thomas Franks | 1540584755961549_1540603695959655 | Hillary won again. Glad to know Hillary did so well. Now it is time to wrap up this election and put it to bed. I have been following Hillary since her primary race against Obama. If you recall, Clinton got more popular votes than Obama. She has always been a serious contender and fighter. This gave her more experience. The election of President Obama was a good thing. Now it is time for the baton to be handed over to Hillary Clinton. It is time for all to come together and give Hillary the respect and the Presidency she deserves. I ask that we give her a resounding victory by giving her the house and the senate. So many people in our country and in our world have so much to gain in her Presidency. She is the symbol of compassion, love and hope. Let us all join her.
17 | Lisa Williams | 1540584755961549_1540594072627284 | Shut up nbc he is right when he says mainstream media is helping rig this election. And no, I don't like either one of them
18 | John Paul Knight | 1540584755961549_1540602312626460 | So what words did he say to hurt him?? Hillary is a liar and watch her eyes as she looks at her papers she was given questions ahead of time!! Oh and most the questions she wouldn't answer!! Oh and she thinks it's ok to kill children at nine months old instead of putting them for adoption very sad!! Oh Clinton foundation takes blood money from other countries to support her campaign!! Oh and violence at Trumps rallies was caused and paid for by Hillary campaign supporters why wasn't that answered?? Last thing why wasn't Hillary asked the question about if she loses will she succeed and congratulate trump why??
19 | Carla Brown Kizer | 1540584755961549_1540646789288679 | This is the worst news coverage ever!!!  The headlines are such a coverup!! Why would anyone say they would absolutely accept the election when a video had just come out where the White House, DNC and Hillary campaign all work together in illegals practices.  It goes into details of how to transport voters from precinct to precinct without being traced; how they pay people to go to rallies and gies into detail of how to start fights. It came right from the horse's mouth and yet you don't cover that.  If that had been the trump campaign that would be the headlines  it is so pathetic how obvious your bias is. I hope your integrity was worth the $$$$.  Yes some illiterates will eat up your fairytale so congratulations. You are as despicable as the baby killing, lying corrupt Clinton machine-well I guess you would be, you are all one in the same.
20 | Mads Frederik Toft | 1540584755961549_1540592652627426 | Well Hillary and Obama policy in the Middle East have send more than the 1 mio refugees to Europe. Forcing that bill on taxpayers in Europe.  With that in mind and with the possibility of the continuation of this if Hillary wins. I wouldn't feel safe with Hillary in White House. If Trump wins he will leave us at the mercy of Putin so I am not comfortable him in the white house either. So as a  European couldn't you guys just vote blank ? Or Gerry Johnston?
21 | Mary Beke Kintz | 1540584755961549_1540603625959662 | The Democratic nominee for President in 2000 rejected the outcome of the election and it went to the Supreme Court. Her answer that is was "horrifying" not to accept the results speaks volumes about hypocrisy AND the likelihood of democratic operative fraud.
22 | Teresa Houck-Hershey | 1540584755961549_1540605355959489 | This was an interview by CNN, but of course they won't show this President Obama Confirms He Will Refuse To Leave Office If Trump Is ElectedBy the Burrard Street Journal - Wednesday, September 7, 2016President Obama refusing to leave if Trump is elected.President Obama refusing to leave if Trump is elected.
23 | Bonnie Williams Cameron | 1540584755961549_1540636805956344 | It is sooo clear who the media is for especially NBC and the host of the TODAY show. I used to love to watch this show. But this ONE SIDED Clinton all the way to the White House stance makes me sick!!!  I won't watch them anymore!  Just another viewer lost because the 'hosts' can't stay a lil neutral during an election year. It's so obvious too!!  Makes me sick!!! And this is the second time I have tried to watch it!! Gone!!
24 | Pat Donworth | 1540584755961549_1540616919291666 | This will all be a moot point in three weeks when Don goes back to work trying to salvage his plummeting empire and now toxic brand. Meanwhile, the GOP will find itself standing stunned and bewildered in the post-election mess, loss of down-ticket seats and all credibility. And Don, like the drunk driver who caused a 15-car smash-up and then obliviously drives away, will go on his merry way denying any culpability for the wreckage strewn behind him.
25 | Tony Herrera | 1540584755961549_1540606719292686 | Dont know if you read body language last night after the debate, but while Hillary was walking around greeting, Trump ran out of there. Pretty sure he went to cry. He knows that was a blowout.

Political points seemed unimportant on a night when a major party nominee raised the possibility of a post-election crisis.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Gary Basham | 1540574619295896_1540576102629081 | Trump is pandering to the most ignorant, most easily manipulated people in America. The funniest part is the reaction of Trump supporters in these comments. It's pure comedy. Poor spelling, bad grammar, poor punctuation, faux news lies, ignorance of current events, no understanding of how our govt works, racism, fear, bigotry, nonsense, complete bullsh!t, and willful stupidity. Trump has assembled a cult of dumfux. I can't wait to see them all crying in Nov.
2 | Dawn Larson | 1540574619295896_1540575455962479 | There will be no 110% of the registered voters casting votes that will be "accepted" without challenge. Unlike Romney who conceded far too early, Trump just threw down the gauntlet and made it very clear, that if any shenanigans or there are election results that are in question, he intends to challenge those results and will not just roll over, as Romney did. I absolutely agree with that. So do millions of voters. Good for him!
3 | Kellie Hunt | 1540574619295896_1540586072628084 | Wow... way to take what Trump didn't say and blow it way out of proportion... Keep reporting your "unbiased news". Where's the reports about Hillary deflecting WikiLeaks?
4 | Pamela Leonard | 1540574619295896_1540578512628840 | I don't blame him one little bit!  With everything that has come out about voter fraud, and, the sizable differences in the rallies, most of us will question it.
5 | Shanon L. Whitt Horridge | 1540574619295896_1540586542628037 | I think our time would be better spent on looking at the candidates records with only 3 weeks to go.... I do not have faith in the media to do the right thing, I do not see neutrality in reporting. Hillary continues to skate.... sad.
6 | Dee Kay Ion | 1540574619295896_1540580579295300 | I dont blame him. You are all crooked. And they rigged the primaries so of course why wouldnt they rig the actual voting. Wouldnt put anything past them at this point.
7 | Rob Maynard | 1540574619295896_1540588602627831 | If Hillary wins she'll be impeached anyways. With the Rigging the election videos she's already close to violating campaign finance law and thats just another added to the other laws she's already broken.
8 | Thomas Franks | 1540574619295896_1540584752628216 | Good report by Washington Post. Hillary won again. Glad to know Hillary did so well. Now it is time to wrap up this election and put it to bed. I have been following Hillary since her primary race against Obama. If you recall, Clinton got more popular votes than Obama. She has always been a serious contender and fighter.

9 | Robert Richter | 1540574619295896_1540584842628207 | I too believe there will be massive voter fraud. I'm with Trump on this issue. I think voter fraud is the goal of Dem's open border plans. Remember what happened in Florida when Dem's tried to steal election there. Take the results to court, if necessary Donald, because you know they would.
10 | Ethel Brooke Brooks | 1540574619295896_1540601905959834 | It's no Surprise he's gonna be a cry baby to the end and she's gonna lie her way right into the white house. I still find it hard to believe these two are the best this country had to offer. Talk about a job nobody wants! 9 months in there will be a sign on the white house lawn Now Hiring For President! Lol we are doomed either way!
11 | Jorge W DeQueiroz | 1540574619295896_1540599005960124 | Everything that comes out of hrc's mouth is a lie (emails, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Haiti, clinton foundation, you name it). No trust in hrc, msm and cronies. Have to closely follow the voting mainly when hrc is running for president together with her record of evil doings. What BO/HRC have done to Chelsea Manning, Snowden and Assange show we have no rights and freedom of the press and speech. We live in a totalitarian State of a kleptocracy that blames all our problems on Russia in public and in private settles uranium deals with them.I'm no great DT fan but the allegations of outright msm pro-hrc PR campaign and avoidance of hrc's destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice, lies and scandals published by Wikileaks which are far more grave make me certain that the only way to see the truth is to alternate power.
12 | Kari Sirianni | 1540574619295896_1540654012621290 | I also think he was trying to communicate it isn't over until the fat lady sings! So, why were they asking him and only him if he'd accept a loss?? Have they already elected her behind closed doors? Disgusting!
13 | Nicholas Rickard | 1540574619295896_1540644219288936 | Trump is gonna whine, and make excuses now, till Nov 8th. Whether, or not he accepts, the elections will still continue. Neither one of them have a good idea with keeping Medicaid, and social security from running out in 2020s, and 2030s,  immigration, and Trumps tax plan isn't too thought out
14 | Dee Ames | 1540574619295896_1540616569291701 | The most important takeaway from the debate, Trump refusing to say he will accept the outcome of the election. I hope all of you are smart enough to be enraged by Trump the Coward, a Man who has not one reservation about undermining the bedrock of our Democracy and that is Free and Fair Elections. This is an insult to our 240 year old Country and to all of the Administrations & Candidates who have lost elections with dignity and transferred powerful in a Diplomatic manner for the good of the people and this Country. The majority of Americans have and will on November 8th resoundingly reject Donald Trump and his ideas. When the numbers come in, pay close attention, they will speak volumes. Why is the #GOP dead? Because feckless Leaders like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are still endorsing Trump and they will refuse to stand up to his behavior, which is just plain "Bigly" Bad for America. #VoteBlue America, the Democratic Party is the ONLY party working for YOU. Madam President, get used to it. #HRC2016
15 | Julie Fitzgerald | 1540574619295896_1540602145959810 | A Hillary Clinton presidency would utterly shatter the rule of law in this country. Our republic is fundamentally grounded in and defined by the law. It cannot exist apart from the law. It cannot be led by a woman who categorically refuses to be subject to the law. And if such a woman manages to seize the reins of power ‚Äî and it looks like she‚Äôs on the cusp, with very little standing in her way ‚Äî it will send a message to the entire population that the law is no longer sovereign in this nation. We will know that our leaders no longer recognize the supremacy of the law, and that fact will cause many citizens to wonder how a leader who does not recognize the law can derive any legitimacy or authority from it:http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/the-rule-of-law-cannot-survive-with-a-crook-like-hillary-clinton-in-the-white-house/
16 | Catherine Carr | 1540574619295896_1540626682624023 | He has NO repect for any Women, after the debate, he want down the stair's first, infront of his Wife, that look's like what  they do in the Middle East ,the Women is allway's behind the so called 'Men" and look at the ugly face lmao, good thing he has money!!
17 | Bau Pham | 1540574619295896_1540593899293968 | Attention!, important for patriot American citizens, do not underestimate it's still depending on your hands, just a reminder to determine have not much time leftover!.Absolutely, righteous saying, if we are reviewed retrospective the past of some decade should be understood to look back consequences of history before the President Barack Obama official received.President Reagan and Bush senior got results to owe huge budget and ...!, cede white house for President Bill Clinton take over.Then a country United States with a great Democrats policy development, economic growing created multiple jobs, citizens get riches and fully paid bad debt leftover, and has developed to bring huge budget surplus results of Democrats policy President Bill Clinton. Then Bush Junior who did change the world bring all jobs investment to CHINA, help China became giant without according international WTO rules, counterfeiting filled global market, disregard trade mark copyright, irresponsible toxic products, then them back to spit action, China's invasion sea territory all around neighborhood countries, plot threatening world peace with nukes weapons etc.., disregard all nations disrespected international law. Ultimately, who is has left the war Middle East IRAQ cause terror ISIS until now, not only promised lies and leave a big mess without solve clean up problems, also increased serious by severe to many thousands of American soldiers had been killed, check out who did intended worst serious tore the American country budget.Obviously, who was destroyed beam terrorism Osama Bin Aden, in addition to President Obama and John Kerry achievement.Trump's represent for presidential to racist matters and there are so many things evil disgusting very dangerous, Trump's care no one but himself, also planning to tore American communities into sections. My opinion to protect America history all in votes for Madam Hillary President 2016-2020 is the best one honestly appreciation.
18 | Rickie Prichard | 1540574619295896_1540682449285113 | The Never Bash Clinton network is rolling full steam this morning.

19 | Jennifer Malone | 1540574619295896_1540601412626550 | The GOP party has been in jeopardy for years if it wasn't trump coming in bringing it to light it would have been someone else.
20 | Pedro Navaja | 1540574619295896_1540619402624751 | They did it to GORE!They might do it to Hillary..!That's why he saying wait till November ...we,re screwed
21 | Roberto Rodriguez Aguil√∫ | 1540574619295896_1540600475959977 | I said it before, and I'll say it again: Donald Trump is working for the Democratic Party. What other explanation is there for making so many stupid comments that would only help many Republicans gravitate to the other side?
22 | Steven Allen Ritnour | 1540574619295896_1540647662621925 | One set for the rich and powerful political class.One set for the unconnected powerless people.Laws that would lock me up for 20 years are just an insignificant annoyance to government operatives.This is my #1 issue when I enter the voting booth.Who is more likely to clean up the corruption?
23 | Eddy Bushara | 1540574619295896_1540583089295049 | For the first time in US history of elections we have a maniac, totally unstable individual who want to be president, that's what broke the camel back of the heavy weight is carrying, sorry!!!!!!
24 | Matthew Leach | 1540574619295896_1540646932621998 | We won't except the election results if trump doesn't win, Because we're feed up with Washington and business as usual.We can't trust our top cop, our top prosecutor or any one in the Obama administration. We can't even trust the media, they're working to manipulate the American public and push democrat party government propaganda.Hillary is corrupt and all she does is put a spin on questions she asked with out answering or being forced to answer.
25 | Walt Cronin | 1540574619295896_1540644259288932 | I have watched NBC news for years but no more. They have been so one sided in this election. Report the news let me make my own decision.

2 | Jessica Burke | 1540526195967405_1540541545965870 | Omg you all are Clinton supporters like what you say truly matters. Clinton is a criminal and needs to be in jail. I mean that's enough to not elect her alone. She is selfish and doesn't want to change. She wants to keep everything the way it is. When you vote Hillary you vote for Obama and let's be honest Obama is a terrible president and Hillary will be even worse
3 | Mike Goldstein | 1540526195967405_1540526415967383 | Debate moderator Chris Wallace brought up Donald Trump‚Äôs charges against Hillary Clinton for defending Bill Clinton when accused of sexual assault during the third presidential debate Wednesday night. Hillary had no response.
4 | Gary Doan | 1540526195967405_1540526785967346 | Trump mentioned a video. I watched it after. The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. Hillary blamed Trump for the violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country.
5 | Joe Barry | 1540526195967405_1540544805965544 | If u vote hillary u shall sit at home and watch as the immigrants rob/loot/bomb/kidnapped/rape/this county with only a baseball bat to protect yourself . Cause she took your second amendment right. All the while paying there bills
6 | Eddy Bushara | 1540526195967405_1540535899299768 | It's very clear that Trump has know knowledge of Politics or strategy, neither economy, he knows he lost the debate and the white house, that's why he said he's not going to accept the result of the election, period..
7 | Kari Soltoski Reuter | 1540526195967405_1540542125965812 | How is this "fact checking"? It's a bunch of statements without references to back them up. Trump is an unstable bully who has no business running for office, however I like REAL facts and referenced data. We don't need more opinions; look no further than your news feed for that!
8 | Darb Sigrah | 1540526195967405_1540531095966915 | Why isn't ANYONE commenting on the fact that she has a teleprompter and Trump does not?
9 | Stephanie Gail | 1540526195967405_1540553832631308 | Excuse me NBC news, but hillary DOES want open borders , she said it herself in one of her paid speeches, it's on paper, clearly your ' fact checking" is blatantly wrong.
10 | Tiffany Wilson | 1540526195967405_555323281321267 | Out of 36 only 5 were fact checking Clinton?? Seems a little one sided. I am sure she said more than 5 things last night. If it was 36 things it should be 18 trump facts and 18 Clinton facts that were checked or close to it. Fact checking 31 trump and 5 Clinton?? Makes NBC look bad.
11 | Bob Scherer | 1540526195967405_1540552492631442 | Trump is right the election is rigged. The media does not report the news anymore they manipulate it to make the news the way they want. The biggest problem is the media and we as citizens need to find away to solve the problem.
12 | Mimi Maricelli Vera | 1540526195967405_1540574842629207 | Did yall notice the "facts" were geared more to one side than the other? Jornalists used to take pride in factual and responsible reporting. Not the case any longer. The media are the puppeteer's and we, the people, are the puppets. We dont think for ourselves anymore. Believe it or not, most "believe" everything they hear because after all, its the media right? It should all be accurate right? WRONG! Its never been more one sided, more recklass or more dangerous with today's headliners.
13 | Maria Aparecida Farnese | 1540526195967405_1540556115964413 | Cmon, she is on tape saying that she wants open borders. And she does! Also you can't find the emails and the money from the state Department?????
14 | Joe Barry | 1540526195967405_1540551625964862 | Get ready for a LANDSLIDE Trump victory in America, it's going to be a huge win for American sovereignty and the final death blow to Globalism (new world order).. The Majority of Americans are voting for Trump because they are sick of business as usual in Washington DC and the American people are fed up with the criminality/corruption that runs rampant in the Federal Government.. There is a Monster vote just hiding under the surface and election day it's going to be seen, so many closet Trump supporters.. Trump = American sovereignty and Hillary Clinton = Globalism (new world order)... Anyone voting for Clinton seriously needs their heads examined.. Trump is the real deal and is not a Puppet to the Globalists. That's why the Zionist mass media, both political parties and the entire Globalist establishment are attacking Trump in every direction possible... The Globalists are losing control every step of the way and the desperation is extremely obvious.
15 | Gary O'Malley | 1540526195967405_1540561539297204 | Funny, Gore 2000 didn't accept the outcome until 3 recounts in Florida, but according to so called moderates, Trump is wrong for not accepting the outcome even before the election is over. Funny stuff.But then again, Gore was a Democrat and anything goes for them, like groping, raping and not accepting outcomes of elections.
16 | Helen Taft | 1540526195967405_1540553905964634 | Clinton didn't have an answer if she would give back the money to countries that have human rights issues and the BIGGEST one Clinton didn't answer....if you are President and Russia invaded the "no fly zone" you establish in Aleppo, will you respond?  (Shoot it down). Absolutely silence on this and a fast change of the topic. I was so angry the Commentator didn't readdress THAT question!!!!
17 | Charles Hubbard | 1540526195967405_1540530895966935 | I'm a proud deplorable and standard Redneck. Trump Pence 2016.
18 | Susan Estes | 1540526195967405_1540579075962117 | I find it amazing that you found all those "facts" so quickly, however did not report about the paid people to attack and incite riots at Trump rallies. Hmmmmm
19 | Stephen Rosenberg | 1540526195967405_1540554829297875 | What a classy man to call her a nasty woman! He reverts to 3rd grade name calling and interrupting like a spoiled child. His defenders argue that he is not given fair treatment in the media, well he actually gets what he deserves. When you throw tantrums, call people names and act childlike you get treated that way!! On top of that he proves time and time again his actual maturity level is that of a adolescent boy. With his talk of women and screaming wrong every time he does not like something! Our country is to great to be run by a 70 year old pre pubescent juvenile delinquent!!
20 | Gary Basham | 1540526195967405_1540547685965256 | These comments are hilarious. Trump supporters believe that since Trump lied more, the media is biased. The media didn't make him lie. He did that.
21 | Robert Palmres | 1540526195967405_1540546859298672 | Quite blaming the Media trump has digged his own hole. The system is not rigged end of story. If trump would have talk about issues i might have voted for him. But he has done none....going Blue. Now he calls himself an outsider and republicans are not happy.
22 | Tammy Dennington Wike | 1540526195967405_1540574055962619 | If trump loses, Hillary will be doomed! He will do whatever it takes to make sure she is held accountable for her Benghazi lies, email scandals, and her corruption. Mark my words! She will pay to play!
23 | Tami Worley Holloman | 1540526195967405_1257267184341584 | Wow! Biased much, NBC News??? üò° I'm not a supporter of either candidate, but it's VERY obvious who you support! Unbiased media went out the window a LONG time ago!!! üò°
24 | Lucille Piccolo | 1540526195967405_1798362187114389 | Wow. Disgusting journalism and I'm not even a Trump supporter! That's just a straight out knock down Trump list with Nothing about Clinton. Thanks for nothings, or if anything, making me think Hillary has a lot to hide since you barely touched on things she has stated! You possibly swayed people the other way!
25 | Orly Pelzer | 1540526195967405_1540548529298505 | She was trying to look unDIRTY, angelic, clean, sweet, trustworthy.. But the only thing she ended up doing was showing us just how quickly she can lie while wearing a CLERGY suit making it look more like a N. Koreian dictatorship with no American Pin showing PANTSUIT. BTW Benny Hinn has a suit Just . Like. This. One. ~dd~

The final presidential debate is in the history books.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ejere Nelsen | 1540489065971118_1540490062637685 | Clinton won by a far margin and even Donald knows that, reason he accused her of beating him "nasty".
2 | Agenor Takang | 1540489065971118_1540489789304379 | Clinton won hands down.. anybody who says otherwise need a hearing test!
3 | Steven Smooth Moore | 1540489065971118_1540493482637343 | All honesty and won't talk for anyone else but... I just can't wait until this is over on November the 8th. This has to be one of the most worst elections... Ever.
4 | Stephen Blaylock | 1540489065971118_1540491989304159 | Let's not forget Trump said, "Very Much Better" last night, so I think the Hillary campaign should put out, "Make America Very Much Better Again" shirts and hats.
5 | Chantale Campbell | 1540489065971118_1540493252637366 | Clinton obviously won.Trump may have done better but that's because he's embarrassed himself so many times that expectations are so low.I mean seriously... forget the floor...the bar is 6 feet under for this guy. Ridiculous.
6 | Kay Lowrey | 1540489065971118_1540492559304102 | NBC poll?  Wouldn't trust them to say the sun rises in the east. They're all in the Democrats pockets. Wait till the day.  That's the only way we'll know for sure.
7 | Gary Doan | 1540489065971118_1540491602637531 | Trump mentioned a video. I watched it after. The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. Hillary blamed Trump for the violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country.
8 | Amy Younggren Cusack | 1540489065971118_1540495849303773 | Any junior high debate team member would steamroll Trump with logic and actual words...
9 | Mercy Brown | 1540489065971118_1540543255965699 | Trump won the debate, he focused on the issues. Hillary didn't respect the moderator and she didn't tell the truth, the only thing that came out of her mouth were lies and more lies. If the people of America have any brains they already know who Hillary Clinton is because they researched the truth and didn't listen to the biased media. Google the Wikileaks and you will find out how evil she is. You can read her face, every time Donald Trump told the truth you can tell her reaction quite easily and that is that she is guilty. She talks so nice and is comfortable doing so because she is a professional liar and a lawyer. Trump is going to win the Presidency, you'll see, many Americans will wake up and vote for Donald Trump on Nov. 8. Trump all the way to the White House.üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
10 | Malik Abdullah | 1540489065971118_1540526612634030 | Donald Dump is Nothing but a White Priviledged, Silver Spoon, Snotty Nosed, 70 yr Old Brat! He's No kind of a Leader! He gets angry and calls people names just like an 8 yr old brat throws fits and wont let anyone play with his ball on the playground.
11 | Gary O'Malley | 1540489065971118_1540564315963593 | Funny, Gore 2000 didn't accept the outcome until 3 recounts in Florida, but according to so called moderates, Trump is wrong for not accepting the outcome even before the election is over.

12 | Travis Murray | 1540489065971118_1540497159303642 | So this is How I, Travis Murray feel. Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn‚Äôt make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television. The one I loved was that, ‚ÄúTrump is arrogant.‚Äù My friend questioned if one man could make ‚Äúthat much difference in the world today.‚Äù To my friend's credit, he was respectful enough to let me respond when he asked, ‚ÄúReally, what has Trump done?‚ÄùI said, ‚ÄúIn June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren‚Äôt properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it‚Äînews now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren‚Äôt liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees‚Äîif you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to ‚Äúliberals.‚ÄùAs the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he‚Äôs not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk‚Äîmeaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ‚ÄùAt this point, what do you have to lose?‚Äù We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year‚Äîone guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I‚Äôve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we‚Äôre in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That‚Äôs your right. Just don‚Äôt ever say he‚Äôs not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh‚Äôs News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise ‚Ä¶ and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase‚Äîthey're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America‚Äôs problem isn‚Äôt that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it‚Äôs high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they‚Äôre not simply the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù as you‚Äôve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them ‚Äúdeplorables.‚Äù The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year.
13 | John Bowers | 1540489065971118_1540496069303751 | Clinton hands down, just by not falling to the floor and bursting into laughter at the idiot standing opposite her.
14 | Gary Basham | 1540489065971118_1540514725968552 | Can anyone tell me without mentioning Hillary, what part of Trump's performance tonight would convince an undecided voter that he is fit and qualified to be president?
15 | Dennis Ricardo | 1540489065971118_1540550409298317 | Schmidt on Donald: ‚ÄúLook at the end of the debate when he says, ‚ÄòYou nasty woman,'‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúHe was incoherent again on national security issues. He was like an old man in the park feeding squirrels arguing with himself on the question of Mosul. He was incoherent on the question of Aleppo, and just somebody who has not prepared himself over the course of the campaign on these vital national security issues.‚Äù
16 | Jorge W DeQueiroz | 1540489065971118_1540491055970919 | No trust in hrc, msm and cronies.What BO/HRC have done to Chelsea Manning, Snowden and Assange show we have no rights and freedom of the press and speech. We live in a totalitarian State of a kleptocracy that blames all our problems on Russia in public and in private settles uranium deals with them.I'm no great DT fan but the allegations of outright msm pro-hrc PR campaign and avoidance of hrc's destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice, lies and scandals published by Wikileaks which are far more grave make me certain that the only way to see the truth is to alternate power.
17 | Donna Markley Simpson | 1540489065971118_1540533082633383 | All 3 debates were ties...Trump supporters say Trump, Hillary supports say Hillary..they both had good points, they both threw the same amount of jabs..equal and if you are a reasonable person, you will think so as well
18 | Joshua Granat | 1540489065971118_1540534272633264 | Who ever wins, they will lead all the people, not just the ones that vote for them. I hope both campaigns cam cut the childish smearing of each other cause it insults all of us. Voting trump doesn't make you a racist, voting clinton doesn't make you a communist. ...this is the worst election I have lived through. Can't believe anything from either one at this point.
19 | Joe Barry | 1540489065971118_1540551912631500 | Get ready for a LANDSLIDE Trump victory in America, it's going to be a huge win for American sovereignty and the final death blow to Globalism (new world order).. The Majority of Americans are voting for Trump because they are sick of business as usual in Washington DC and the American people are fed up with the criminality/corruption that runs rampant in the Federal Government..

20 | Peter McGennis Sr. | 1540489065971118_1540579005962124 | OK the debates are over. Our country is awash in CORRUPTION at every level of government including both Republicans and Democrats. Insider corrupt Republicans and Democrats along with the corrupt media, DOJ, AND FBI are working for Hillary and against Trump, and the big story is Trump not saying he will accept the results of the election. ELECT DONALD TRUMP, AND DRAIN THE SWAMP. Maybe then we can have elections we can trust.
21 | Phillip Sheppard | 1540489065971118_1540503772636314 | You know who the real losers of last nights debate were? The writers at Saturday Night Live.Between:"Bad Hombres""Such a nasty women"Tune in next time to see if I honor the Democratic process.Bringing in a foreign born Muslim as his guest (even though he wants them banned).The writers at SNL are probably concerned that Lorne Michaels will decide that he really doesn't need them anymore.
22 | Grace Reyna Olivares Delgado | 1540489065971118_1540556342631057 | Trump is right when he says the media is bias.. He exposes the dirty truth about Hillary and the media.. Based on this latest post about NBC fast fact .. It seems as though NBC stands for NOBODY BUT CLINTONüò°
23 | Tom Stowe | 1540489065971118_1540507965969228 | Neither has proven themselves worthy of my vote. I fear another four years will be wasted, driving the divide in the Union further apart. We really need someone who will Unite and Lead this country, I fear we will end up with one form or another of a Scary Clown that is going burn it down, and sell us out to the highest bidder. Quality; Job None where our choice for President lies.
24 | Karen Voelker | 1540489065971118_1540565702630121 | Hillary is a robotic yes "man" who is part of the bildeberg group along with her husband to implement a new world order. They want open borders and free trade with one world currency and one world military... It's all part of the master plan to program our youth to memorize and obey so they don't question as free thinkers... Im sad for our youth.
25 | Mercy Brown | 1540489065971118_1540574005962624 | By the way, how come Trump rallies have over 20,000 people attend them and the media doesn't even cover it, all they focus on are his negative issues. Don't listen to the biased polls, they're not true. If the media was fair and balanced Donald Trump would be far ahead of Hillary. The media is controlled by the Hillary camp so of course they do everything in their power to bash Donald Trump and make Hillary look good. Focus on the Wikileaks issue, we should put Hillary in jail, she is not fit to be the President. She's a criminal and a baby killer. She has no emotions at all and is only concerned with her own personal interests. She is the leader of ISIS. Look at her, she doesn't even wear the American flag, that being said, she is not a true American and you are going to vote for her?

‚ÄúJohn Podesta said you have terrible instinct. Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment ‚Äì I agree with both," Donald J. Trump said.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Vincent James Mcentee | 1540462125973812_1540462575973767 | Trump could say that he has a sexual attraction to puppies and his supporters would still say "what about Hillarys emails?"
2 | Valerie Kelly | 1540462125973812_1540467829306575 | The statement that concerns me the most is that she plans on overthrowing Assad, continuing perpetual wars and nation building.  Enough of these Middle Eastern leaders.  Look at the mess and all the innocent lives lost, and money spent for nothing.
3 | Gary Doan | 1540462125973812_1540463365973688 | The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people.

4 | Alex Perez | 1540462125973812_1540469692639722 | Idk why but since the last debate I've got a slight crush on Hilary.... maybe it was the shimmy haha (not voting for either)
5 | Joe Barry | 1540462125973812_1540552875964737 | Get ready for a LANDSLIDE Trump victory in America, it's going to be a huge win for American sovereignty and the final death blow to Globalism (new world order)..

6 | Allan Cohen | 1540462125973812_1540675045952520 | I do not care if Donald Trump called a woman fat. I do not care if he tried to sleep with a woman or if he likes "beautiful" women. I care that he sent a plane to pick up 200 Marines who were stranded after desert storm. I care that he supports our police officers and first responders. I care that he supports guns and standing behind our military. I care that he supports the death penalty and is AGAINST abortion. I care that he supports enforcing immigration laws. I care that he wants to destroy radical Islamic groups. I care that he supports COAL. These are things I care about. Him talking sexually about women does not bother me. Were they mean words? Yes. Were they words spoken in PRIVATE? Yes. Have you ever talked to your friends about the opposite sex in private and said things? I'm positive all of you have. But, News Flash!! Women have been sexualized for centuries!! Jay-Z, Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne and every single other rapper helped establish that platform, but people are ok with music blasted all over the radio degrading women. Ever heard of Victoria Secret? Or their fashion show? Ever heard of Hooters? People are ok with that too. Until all of these things are different, women will be viewed this way. Your precious Obama couldn't change that and Hillary can't either. I feel sorry for the women Donald has belittled and said terrible things about. But I'm still much more offended by what Hillary Clinton has DONE over what Donald Trump has SAID... PERIOD!!!! So Trump doesn't do well at the debates, maybe he even sounds childish and incapable. But he is speaking the truth! Just because he's not a polished politician like Hilary or Obama doesn't mean he's unqualified to be president. He cares for this country, not growing the size of his pockets. That man has so much money he could never spend it all. He gets NOTHING out of being president! I'm standing for the man accused of saying mean words. I'll never back a woman under three different scandal investigations, possible murder at Benghazi, and the secretive email scandal which has been nothing but lies from the beginning. Trump 2016!!!Copy and paste!!!
7 | Lawrence Webster | 1540462125973812_1540479629305395 | This was a devastating knockout blow to Hilary's jaw by Trump.Her campaign,and her cohorts are corrupt, immoral,and delusional.
8 | Dawn Boone | 1540462125973812_1540636542623037 | Wikileaks, you said this‚ÄîI want to quote‚Äî‚ÄùMy dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.‚Äù That‚Äôs the question, is that your dream?The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks, even if we don‚Äôt know for sure whether they are. Do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American elections? Stop bringing Russia up! Hillary you put the information out there and it doesn't matter how it was obtained. She did not answer the question. Or the question on her foundation.
9 | Justin Hoag | 1540462125973812_1540469555973069 | They are both war hawks. The only difference is that Trump hasn't left the nest, and doesn't know how far he has to fly. Hillary has flown the same route a long time.
10 | Monica Ayres Kooger | 1540462125973812_1540636672623024 | Both are scary but what I find most scary is his ties to the Russians( prove it wrong!!) -and his inability to know he needs to master subject matter. Disrespect for handicapped, women, and his name calling and childish behavior are alarming. He had been a breath of fresh air but now its toxic unless he shows his financials.
11 | Dawn Boone | 1540462125973812_1540553029298055 | She avoided questions about her Foundation and when a question was asked about a Wicki Leak she avoided the question and blamed the Russians for these leaks! She avoided the question completely That is a little pathetic. You the media should be ashamed at your selves for not picking up on this and reporting it. Poor journalism........... What ever happened to great gutsy journalism.........
12 | Gary O'Malley | 1540462125973812_1540564555963569 | Funny, Gore 2000 didn't accept the outcome until 3 recounts in Florida, but according to so called moderates, Trump is wrong for not accepting the outcome even before the election is over. Funny stuff.But then again, Gore was a Democrat and anything goes for them, like groping, raping and not accepting outcomes of elections.
13 | Sharon Hayes Libardoni | 1540462125973812_1540686432618048 | Did anyone notice that when Hillary was confronted about Wikileaks's regarding open boarders her reply was " If you read the next line you would see that I was referring to energy."???? She just admitted that the emails are in fact hers. üëç
14 | Catherine Colosimo | 1540462125973812_1540571645962860 | I'm tired of emails being leaked. The REAL problem is that they are able to be hacked in the first place and that Trump encourages espionage against the United States.
15 | Rickie Prichard | 1540462125973812_1540683022618389 | The Never Bash Clinton network is rolling full steam this morning. I have about 6 different major news networks that show up on my page, you guys are hands down the most aggressive this morning...... It's just too bad it's not unbiased journalism.
16 | Thomas Franks | 1540462125973812_1540614345958590 | Hillary won again. Glad to know Hillary did so well. Now it is time to wrap up this election and put it to bed. I have been following Hillary since her primary race against Obama. If you recall, Clinton got more popular votes than Obama. She has always been a serious contender and fighter. This gave her more experience. The election of President Obama was a good thing. Now it is time for the baton to be handed over to Hillary Clinton. It is time for all to come together and give Hillary the respect and the Presidency she deserves. I ask that we give her a resounding victory by giving her the house and the senate. So many people in our country and in our world have so much to gain in her Presidency. She is the symbol of compassion, love and hope. Let us all join her.
17 | Papo Morales | 1540462125973812_1540488909304467 | We don't care about the emails, we are concerned about you sitting on a chair where you do not belong, a good leader unites the people, you have no clue or desire to do that, later for you and your nasty ways!
18 | Sylvia Scheller | 1540462125973812_1540610459292312 | We've tried Republicans and Democrats, There is more than enough room for more parties and their ideas to flourish. Anyone else sick of divisiveness and petty argument simply for petty arguments sake? C'mon, WE THE PEOPLE ARE BETTER THAN THIS EVEN IF OUR CANDIDATES ARE NOT! #TheyBothSuck2016
19 | John Livinston | 1540462125973812_1540570619296296 | wow - looks like Trump was forced to take a few Ritalin's before the debate, but it started wearing off 30mins into the debate!
20 | Chidi Ebere | 1540462125973812_1540566315963393 | People should stop reading or watching mainstream media misinformation craps news, rather go to YouTube video and search for the truth. Lies attract liars. Hillary Clinton leading is only in mainstream media paper not in reality.
21 | Alvin Barker | 1540462125973812_1540631189290239 | Point blank, if Trump wins, we stay cordial with all other nations in the world. If Hillary is elected, then other nations are going to nuclear war with us.
22 | Stan Stewart | 1540462125973812_1540569959296362 | Trump seems unable or unwilling to understand that America is operated through a democratic form of government, not an autocracy. He repeatedly presents himself as a person who isn't open to advice and mistakenly or arrogantly believes a President is a Dictator. His predictions of his post-election actions, should he win or lose, are areas of concern because a President Trump would abuse the powers of the Presidency to:enact revenge upon Clinton and others who speak against him, to attempt to scale back freedom of the press, eliminate a woman's right to choose regarding birth control and abortion, and,he seems unconcerned regarding the importance of alliances with foreign powers who (like America) seek democratic government. Trump's attitudes towards minorities, women, Muslims, disabled people, and veterans demonstrates a bias and indifference towards these and other groups, which make up a significant portion of the American population. A President with glaring biases such as these, who has also now threatened to stack the Supreme Court with Justices who would likely repeal Civil Rights laws and ban abortions, is not one who allows equality. Such a person would be a dictator, a despot, in addition to what Trump already has proven himself to be: a sociopathic bigoted sexist demagogue.
23 | Judith Mike Cook | 1540462125973812_1540521172634574 | Hillary, true to corrupt career politicians, talked fast and over the top of everyone...lies and contradictions rolled out of her mouth as smooth as silk. She lied about wanting open borders, she lied about compassion for the children (she supports all abortions)..she lied about Russia, she lied about rigging the election and violence at the Trump rallies, she lied about the Clinton Foundation, she lied about her experience...Hell...what DIDN'T she lie about?.
24 | Craig Colt | 1540462125973812_1540473015972723 | Quinnipiac University poll found that Hillary Clinton is leading the race for the White House with 47 percent of the vote, compared to Trump‚Äôs 40 percent when third-party candidates are included.But 55 percent of voters told pollsters Trump was right when he charged the media is biased against, compared to 42 percent who said it wasn‚Äôt.
25 | Mark K Gamini | 1540462125973812_1540505039302854 | PODESTA have to resign and charged why he is useing Gmails . Where is billions of $ tax money spend in Cyber security... there are plenty of Gmail having videos in you tube..

"What Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that that's okay, and Hillary can say that that's okay, but that's not okay with me," Donald J. Trump said.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Olia Catala | 1540422945977730_1540424185977606 | Ripping the baby out of the womb on the 9th month is called child birth.. #crazydonald
2 | Robin Hicks | 1540422945977730_1540427172643974 | My niece was 8 months pregnant when the doctors told her that her baby was going to be born with most of his organs on the outside of his body and would not live for the latest of a month if not at birth because of this. She was devastated beyond belief as we all were. She had already redone a room as the nursery. They told her the best thing for the baby AND her was to abort. She cried as we all did for months. I personally (for myself) don't agree with abortion for several reasons but there are circumstances that sometimes that calls for this.
3 | Bridget Sullivan | 1540422945977730_1540425572644134 | Huh, wasn't aware that I and my brother were products of a very late term abortions....I was always told we were c-sections. Have to say, for a late term abortion, I'm surprisingly healthy and full of life. I'm a medical marvel!
4 | Deborah Kaplan | 1540422945977730_1540441302642561 | This is so distorted and misrepresented by trump. He doesnt know what hes talking about. He is so inflammatory, exaggerates and lies to defend his position, that he will use these same distortions, lies, exaggerations and misrepresentations in dealing with foreign governments, leaders, his own staff and congress. He cannot be trusted to tell the truth or even get close to it. This is just another example of why he'd make a terrible potus. The world will laugh at him for his insanity.
5 | Ejere Nelsen | 1540422945977730_1540423185977706 | Apparently Trump doesn't drink but as it stands now, I think some pints of beer will help him far better than whatever he is sniffing that is making him as high as an electric transformer (yet without any electricity supply).Have some pints Donald and calm down buddy.
6 | Jason Mumford | 1540422945977730_1540425029310855 | I'm not pro-abortion, but I'm all about a woman's right to choose, a man or government should not make that decision.
7 | Molly Runyon | 1540422945977730_1540430162643675 | Why would Hillary care about gun control so toddlers don't get killed or kill others, then say abortion up to 9th month ok? She said, had to do with moms health. Mom's wellfare. Please pay attention.  She's a grandma now. Kids are very important to her.
8 | Debbie Moran | 1540422945977730_1540444715975553 | I do not believe in abortion, but I don't believe that it is the governments place to tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her body.  Please ladies...use birth control!   And if you're a victim of a crime...may the Lord stand by you with whatever choice you need to make!
9 | Terry Barton | 1540422945977730_1540438929309465 | An estimate by the federal government reveals that 91.4% of abortions in the United States occur within the first 13 weeks of presidency. Only 1.3% of abortions occur later than 21 weeks into presidency. Zero occur on ‚Äúthe final day,‚Äù which by definition would not be an abortion, it would be classified as an infanticide.
10 | Tony Piscitelli | 1540422945977730_1540431802643511 | Only Hillary lied under oath in a Congressional investigation.Only Hillary Clinton in 1974 was fired from a job (Watergate Committee) for being unethical.Only Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails after she was ordered to hand them over to the Fed.Only Hillary Clinton had that same computer server wiped (BleachBit) clean by professionals.Only Hillary Clinton got the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughed about it.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about Benghazi.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about her emails.Only Hillary Clinton lied about being under sniper fire.Only Hillary Clinton lied about lying to the American people.Only Hillary Clinton was involved in "Cash Cow"Only Hillary Clinton has a long list of scandals.Only Hillary Clinton nationally belittled her husband's sexual harassment and rape accusers.Only Hillary Clinton is a career politician.Only Hillary Clinton will not release her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banks.Only Hillary Clinton is tied to Monsanto.Only Hillary Clinton was labeled " Extremely careless " about national security by the FBI !Only Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class.Only Hillary Clinton benefited from the DNC rigging an election !Only Hillary Clinton had to return stolen items from the White House.Only Hillary Clinton said the Benghazi victims parents where lying.Only Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her based on her gender.Only Hillary Clinton has no real accomplishments after a lifetime in politics.Only Hillary Clinton has never created any jobs.Only Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI and found to have put national security at risk.Only Hillary Clinton has had two or more movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics and integrityOnly Hillary Clinton was called "Broomstick one" by the Secret ServiceOnly Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would of simply told the truth in the first place ! Fact - all facts !
11 | Kirsti N√∏dland | 1540422945977730_1540429732643718 | I am sooo happy living in a sivilized country like Norway, where this is NOT  an issue other than between the woman and her doctor!
12 | Jerusha Hardman | 1540422945977730_1540456689307689 | I'm so sick of hearing men like this talk about things they don't understand and never will. And he can't even get the facts straight. No woman gets to 8 or 9 months and thinks 'eh I changed my mind' and goes gets an abortion. Like 1% of abortions are in the third trimester and ALL of those are for horrible medical reasons. Most abortions happen before 13 weeks. But ya know... instead of arguing about abortion why don't we start working  on fixing the reasons women would seek one out? I've never heard an ant-choice politician say what he is going to do to help would be mothers and fathers to make having a baby a better choice then abortion. Never! In fact I hear only how they will make it worse. Banning abortion will not stop abortion. Prohibition never works. Solving problems does.
13 | Jodie Everidge Shearer | 1540422945977730_1540455512641140 | I'm so sick and tired of people saying that women use abortions as s method of birth control. I'd like to ask you that feel this way, how do YOU know??? I've known 3 women to have them, and in all cases, it was the most gut wrenching, heartbreaking thing they'd ever have to deal with. So I just want to know, where are you getting this information???
14 | Kimberly Tillett | 1540422945977730_1540473582639333 | If you don't see this as a last ditch effort to stir up the slightest amount of votes on Drumpf's part, then you're as blind as you are stupid. This man has never cared about any of these issues and he never will. He's a psychopath pandering for attention.
15 | Kaja Wooten-Bowman | 1540422945977730_1540429025977122 | You fools. They kill the baby. It's not a c-section. It's a partial birth abortion.  The baby is killed in the womb, and delivered dead, No medical attention given to the baby, if it survives the abortion, in most cases It takes an evil soul to stop a beating heart, and MURDER a baby.
16 | Anita Hunter | 1540422945977730_1540482575971767 | Listen, if men could get pregnant, there would be drive through abortion clinics. And if they could pregnant due to rape or incest...they'd have doctors come to their house! As someone who chose abortion at 12 weeks because of a rape, most of you Hillary haters offend me. I didn't asked to get raped, and certainly couldn't just "close my legs" and statements like that are just ignorant. I didn't ask to get pregnant and having the choice to have an abortion felt like I finally had some control over what had become a three month nightmare. I hope none of your daughters or sisters ever go through what I went through.
17 | Anita Hunter | 1540422945977730_1540492555970769 | And all you people who claim to be "pro-life" if you aren't willing to see tax dollars go to feed, house, educate and protect the child after it's born, then you aren't pro-life...you're PRO-BIRTH!
18 | Linda O'brien | 1540422945977730_1540425625977462 | Terrorism in the world will continue if clinton will win. Soon you will pay for what you have done. The wrath of the world will come upon you.
19 | Luis Avila | 1540422945977730_1540459132640778 | Trump just loves to argue with women , fixation or a fetish. It's not normal, it is unattractive for a men. Furthermore it develops into a catfight. No offense but it is really getting to be annoying. Trump looks more of a wrestle mania bully . Enough is enough with this goon and his circus.. i can't imagine giving him the spotlight 4 years. OMG.
20 | Ron Miller | 1540422945977730_1540482792638412 | Dump the trump it is hard to believe this idiot got passed the 5th grade with his comment rip the baby out of the womb. stop the dramatics dumpty, maybe now we understand why your a loose cannon you were ripped from your mothers womb .
21 | Darrin Savage | 1540422945977730_1540443625975662 | I'm totally against, partial birth abortion. Under the Bush administration. The Supreme court, voted this down. It would very difficult to reverse this law. I disagree with a lot of things, that Hillary represents. But I also feel that Trump, is a farce. He was totally pro choice, before running for President. He's no more a conservative, than Madonna is. We know what Hillary is. Do we know who Trump, truly is though??. I just can't support him. Needless to say, we have little to choose from.
22 | Jennifer Lopez | 1540422945977730_1540515445968480 | It goes beyond abortions. This man is trying to turn the clock back.  I'm pro-life because I CHOOSE to be, not because some law is dictating what I can or can't do as a woman. These people want to criticize women who have abortions but also want to slam women who have five or six children! Where is the penalty for the men in these situations? Let me guess, "SHE should have used birth control, SHE should of gotten her tubes tied, SHE shouldn't of been sleeping around." The double standard with this man is obvious! And in the case of rape? There are way too many circumstances for people to think they have a right to tell a woman how to handle her body.Women, look at the numbers from the last election. We were the majority. Don't forget that!
23 | Susan Peters | 1540422945977730_1540450385974986 | Nor said, not meant. Especially  from a man who procreates for machismo, but has said he has no interest in the actual raising and parenting of his own children. Yes, it's documented, audio and visual.
24 | Wayne Miller | 1540422945977730_1540424469310911 | Well paying off more rebels 1.6 billion and planing to pay more is beyond childish. It's stupid 911 never forget. Vote for Hillary you vote for terrorist
25 | William Todd | 1540422945977730_1540431452643546 | On many news articles online I am seeing a lot of people saying that Hillary's position on aborting babies up to term has pushed them to Trump. Some of my undecided friends saying the same. #HillarySupportsDeath #Benghazi #WeCameWeSawTheyDied #InstigatingRussianWar

Here are 11 moments that stood out from the final face-off between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | T Elliott Cato | 1540387122647979_1540389085981116 | Attention Visitors: The Trumpanzees are currently in the midst of one of their frequent poo flinging fests. For your own well-being please do not attempt to engage, inform or feed the animals as they process their grief, but feel free to scroll through and observe their antics as they rage among themselves.Management greatly appreciates your patience and self-discipline.
2 | Bryan Dombi | 1540387122647979_1540452292641462 | I always vote Democrat and was prepared to vote for Hillary but after watching all three debates and looking at all the facts and the overwhelming amount of corruption it is clear I must vote for Donald Trump. I hope others like myself can see past party affiliations and vote for the better candidate based on policy and integrity and that person is Donald Trump by a long shot!
3 | Dawn Larson | 1540387122647979_1540392672647424 | You missed one .. Hillary Clinton told the world our response time for launching nukes at the debate tonight .. isn't that classified information?
4 | Alexis Gonzalez | 1540387122647979_1540389009314457 | Tonight Hillary confirmed she will send troops to Syria, where Russia is playing a huge role. I refuse to vote for the woman who will send in  my brothers and sisters in arms to ANOTHER middle eastern conflict to get slaughtered! Wasn't Iraq and Benghazi enough bloodshed for you, Hillary?! üò°üò°üò°
5 | Joel Robards | 1540387122647979_1540405882646103 | What about Hillary saying "Baghdaddy" or the lipstick on her tooth?  Oh, and Hillary refusing to answer the pay for play question, essentially admitting she is guilty. Somehow that one seemed to slip by you nbc, but don't worry, the rest of the country caught it.
6 | Bonita Raitt Burton | 1540387122647979_1540402949313063 | NBC News.... I am ASHAMED of how you take sides in this election. Your JOB is to report the news.... NOT TAKE SIDES. I am embarrassed and sick of how you stand up for Hillary who is for abortion which is murder, lies about the Clinton Foundation, lies about her part in Benghazi, the murders of our Ambassador and innocent American lives, gay marriages which is against God.... THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.
7 | Wayne Miller | 1540387122647979_1540421039311254 | Well paying off more rebels 1.6 billion and planing to pay more is beyond childish. It's stupid 911 never forget. Vote for Hillary you vote for terrorist
8 | Joe Barry | 1540387122647979_1540559302630761 | Get ready for a LANDSLIDE Trump victory in America, it's going to be a huge win for American sovereignty and the final death blow to Globalism (new world order).. The Majority of Americans are voting for Trump because they are sick of business as usual in Washington DC and the American people are fed up with the criminality/corruption that runs rampant in the Federal Government.. There is a Monster vote just hiding under the surface and election day it's going to be seen, so many closet Trump supporters.. Trump = American sovereignty and Hillary Clinton = Globalism (new world order)... Anyone voting for Clinton seriously needs their heads examined.. Trump is the real deal and is not a Puppet to the Globalists. That's why the Zionist mass media, both political parties and the entire Globalist establishment are attacking Trump in every direction possible... The Globalists are losing control every step of the way and the desperation is extremely obvious.
9 | Monica Buchholz | 1540387122647979_1540403105979714 | I just want to know what she snorted up her left nostril before show time. Why can't she use a tissue and how come she thought it was a good idea to shake anybodys hands with her snot covered hands???? So gross just imagine if she does that kind of gross to the leaders of other countries, no wonder they don't respect her.
10 | Glenn Dawson | 1540387122647979_1540408075979217 | There are non documented folk who are registered to vote and Clinton thinks that‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶ think about that for a second ‚Ä¶. Non US citizen voting for president ‚Ä¶..Sounds like her open borders policy is in place already ‚Ä¶.Looks rigged to me......Clinton asked about deleted emails after they were subpoenaed talks about anything else ‚Ä¶Hillary is confronted about recent Wikileaks proof that she pays people to incite violence at Trump rallies. Hillary goes uhhh...but Russia, Putin, espionage, blah blah blah. In her own words, what difference does it really make... Clinton up in arms about toddlers and guns but promotes unborn babies being murdered so they can not become toddlers she claims she cares about‚Ä¶ Clinton claims Trump would be a puppet for Putin but Clinton has already given Russia increased power over the uranium market whilst she was in charge of the state dept ‚Ä¶. Clinton was also instrumental in getting companies such as Cisco, Google, Intel among others to enter Russia and guess who has a huge investment in this?? That‚Äôs right Putin‚Ä¶. So looks like we all know who would be the puppet ‚Ä¶ And that before we even get to her campaign manager..
11 | Thomas Cassidy | 1540387122647979_1540391855980839 | Wow...Hillary Clinton tells the world our nuclear response time. Reckless, just like her emails. #HillaryForPrison #ExposeClintonCrimes #WikiLeaksBlock
12 | KevinKelly GladysSmith | 1540387122647979_1540481442638547 | Hillary more than keeps her lead at the end of the debates. More important that GOP Ryan and Rubio are  telling Americans to NOT listen to Russia Wikileaks...Do we call her Mrs President or Madam President ?
13 | Lynn Young Chamberlin | 1540387122647979_1540389819314376 | If I see that it's an article from NBC I won't even read their crap because it's so obviously biased.....scroll on by
14 | Chidi Ebere | 1540387122647979_1540593722627319 | People should stop reading or watching mainstream media misinformation craps news, rather go to YouTube video and search for the truth. Lies attract liars. Is like Hillary Clinton has bribed the mainstream media to campaign for her, because from all indications they are biased in reporting Clinton criminality and crimes, and never condemn her destroying the emails and other evil conduct.
15 | Anita Hall-Dokman | 1540387122647979_1540568789296479 | Why do Trump supporters keep believing the untruths and conspiracy theories? It turns out they lack an important part of the brain that determines reality from fantasy."A new study suggests that people‚Äôs ability to distinguish between what really happened and what was imagined may be determined by the presence of a fold at the front of the brain that develops late in pregnancy, and is missing entirely in 27% of people.""The key brain structure identified by the study is called the paracingulate sulcus (PCS), a fold in part of the prefrontal cortex, the region that is involved with planning, thought and judgment."http://healthland.time.com/2011/10/05/reality-check-why-some-brains-cant-tell-real-from-imagined/
16 | Thomas Franks | 1540387122647979_1540614625958562 | Hillary won again. Glad to know Hillary did so well. Now it is time to wrap up this election and put it to bed.

This gave her more experience. The election of President Obama was a good thing. Now it is time for the baton to be handed over to Hillary Clinton. It is time for all to come together and give Hillary the respect and the Presidency she deserves. I ask that we give her a resounding victory by giving her the house and the senate. So many people in our country and in our world have so much to gain in her Presidency. She is the symbol of compassion, love and hope. Let us all join her.
17 | Dan Lundgren | 1540387122647979_1540684295951595 | My favorite one liner is the "the immigrates Trump will deport pay more taxes than this billionaire" Just because he can get away with it, dose not make it right.
18 | Jack Perry | 1540387122647979_1540389165981108 | The entire campaign season has only been "nasty" because Trump was part of it. What a complete douchenozzle he is.
19 | Joe Blas | 1540387122647979_1540642862622405 | If Hitlary wins, after she lets in all those Syrian refugees I wonder what all her supporters say after they are put in cages and treated like animals after the refugees take control of the country!
20 | Kieran Sutherland | 1540387122647979_1540393419314016 | Bribe!! The Clinton emails. "Lastly, on a much more practical note: to get you out of this I am going to have to bribe Channel 2 with a significant and exclusive interview when we are in Jerusalem in two weeks, and I guarantee you that will be far more painful than  tomorrow's relative short and peaceful format."

21 | Valera Kalinin | 1540387122647979_1540394019313956 | Why is for the "western world" (for the US) do not need Donald Trump?Because the "western world" (the US) do not want change.Donald chose the slogan for his presidential campaign: "Make America Great Again!"But, the majority of the citizens "western world" still do not doubt at "greatness" of US today.And they are most afraid of change for the worse.But, Donald needs to explain to these people that their "great country" is rapidly slides into the abyss and he must to promise make changes, which will not worsen the financial situation of the citizens, but will save the US from the collapse.Donald needs to explain that integration with Russia is the only chance for save the US economy (and world economy).There are only two "drivers", which able  to push the world economy:1. Development of the world transport infrastructure (it is impossible without the participation of the vast Russian territories).2. The Space exploration:__ Building a space defense from asteroids and from the "sunstroke".__ The construction of "Space Ark".(it is also impossible without Russia's participation).Also, recovery of the world order (International Legislation of) is impossible without Russia's armed forces.And, most importantly, Russia is the last bastion of Christianity (is the last bastion of spiritual revival of the "white race").
22 | Rafi Elsha | 1540387122647979_1540403649312993 | I used to hate Hillary but from 8 years i am searching and reading about her work and policies but you know what afrer all these 8 years i still hate hillary Clinton/:
23 | Hernan Senoren | 1540387122647979_1540607562625935 | Remix: I'm reaching out to my big donors who owns the big media to keep me afloat by shielding me through our bias anchorman and false polls. I'm reaching out to all my field campaign paid armies to ripped registration ballots and incite violence at Trump rallies. I'm reaching out to my liberals and illegals immigrant supporters to vote for me and turn this whole country upside down morally bankrupt and financially drain.
24 | Russ Bischoff | 1540387122647979_1540390789314279 | ‚Äì Hillary talks, but says a whole lot of nothing ‚Äì Nothing but political platitudes ‚Äì "Invest in the middle class"? ‚Äì What the hell is that supposed to mean ‚Äì It's about jobs ‚Äì She's so full crap, it's ridiculous.The bottom line is that "Our Government" has to protect domestic industry and the jobs that those industries provide ‚Äì If they do that, the rest will take care of itself.If anyone really thinks that Hillary Clinton is ever going to do anything to help the American People, the real American economy or the security of our country, they're sadly mistaken and delusional.Bringing manufacturing back home to the USA is going to end up being not only a key to restoring our economy, but to maintaining our national security as well.Establishment puppet politicians, corrupt manipulative media pundits, Hillary trolls and their masters can put their BS in a box, gift wrap it and even put a bow on top, but most Americans can still smell what's inside.Anyone with half a brain knows that we cannot trust or believe the corrupt manipulative media, who is owned and controlled by Wall Street FreeTraitors, international corporations and foreign interests that are responsible for the traitorous trade and immigration policies that have destroyed the real American economy and the economic future of the American people.
25 | Yoko Sugata | 1540387122647979_1540557435964281 | Trump is a man child who has no idea what the hell he's talking about. Big fail. I was tortured for 90 minutes listening to his ramblings and every time I wanted to throw up, Hillary brought me back to the world of intelligence. Big win for Hillary last night and all the other debates.

This wasn't quite the immigration discussion we were expecting.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sharon Kay Bradshaw Yeates | 1540363412650350_1540386319314726 | So, two days ago Trump's wife was on the news saying that Trump apologized to her and his family about his comments and that she has decided to forgive him. Tonight he said he did not apologize for it because he didn't do it. He just called his own wife a liar.
2 | Heath Salter | 1540363412650350_1540364689316889 | Aborting an infant in the 3rd trimester is disgusting no matter what your stance is.
3 | Brandon Still | 1540363412650350_1540365499316808 | Donald J. Trump says Mexico is going to pay for the wall, but when he met with the Mexican president "he choked," Hillary Clinton says. Lol
4 | Michael Everest Dominguez | 1540363412650350_1540381569315201 | As a Hispanic I find this whole "bad hombres" thing truly stupid. I'm not at all offended and you have to really stretch or just want to be offended by something for you to honestly be offended by it. And, no, I'm not a trump supporter, I just don't like the idiocy we're living in that we're at the point where this is offensive and/or racist.
5 | Skip Gilbert | 1540363412650350_1540375932649098 | The whole 90 minutes, Hillary lying the majority of the time, and, this is all you can focus on... LIEberal Deflection at it's finest
6 | Silvia Fernandez Zarifian | 1540363412650350_1540401392646552 | Clearly the word "hombre" isn't offensive...not in the least, but he uses it like a stone and adds a negative connotation by associating it with bad acts. Just like when he says, "the" African Americans or "the" Hispanics. It's a way of "othering" and dividing us by making it, us and them. He has made it perfectly clear how he feels about Hispanics, in general. He's speaking of the Mexicans and the wall, so using hombre instead of bad dudes or bad men or bad people, was deliberate, negative and offensive.
7 | Mike Phillip Moore | 1540363412650350_1540371682649523 | It's the Spanish word for Dude! If you're a naive Democrat journalist for NBC NEWS you might want to Google before you spend hours working on a post hoping you got some propaganda worth a ding dong. Note: Defined as a man, especially one of a particular type.
8 | Lauralyn Weiser | 1540363412650350_1540365589316799 | Tonight during the final presidential debate Hillary Clinton leaked more national security secrets.Hillary said it took four minutes between the nuclear order and nukes flying.Careless Hillary told the WORLD the US 'Nuclear Response' Time!!
9 | Dawn Geren | 1540363412650350_1540400789313279 | I hate abortion too BUT her point was about serious medical issues, like someone else said it rarely happens only in life or death situations or quality of life for the child. tough freaking decisions. in late term abortions. definitely need safe guards but her point was do you want the govt deciding that or a highly skilled team of doctors advising you
10 | William H Kien | 1540363412650350_1540383865981638 | Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know.So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."No I did not write this, its a share of a share of share, I don't take any credit but I thought it was to hilarious that it deserved to be reshared.
11 | Paula Michele Flores Vilchez | 1540363412650350_1540392205980804 | Its sad that "some" of you deplorables look intellegent but are soooo stupid especially when you open your mouths!!#deporables#hitlertrump#imwithher#voteblue
12 | Nelcidor Kenzie | 1540363412650350_1540401002646591 | Remember #Adolf #hitler was also popular amongst his party line at one point in time too with his message fueled with frustration, division and hatred.

That's what we pay them to do, and we expect them to be good at it too.

13 | Juan Wiseman | 1540363412650350_1540614585958566 | This part of the debate is wherethe "Trump train" left the tracks. Military strategy dating back to"The Art of War" (written 2 centuries before the New Testament)understands that wars are won (or lost) by a nation's ability to"manufacture" during war. Our NATO Alliance and military basesaround the world give us the ability to destroy the manufacturingcapability of our greatest enemies during war. Our alliances andoccupation of foreign nations are for OUR DEFENSE. (not theirs)Most of these nations don't want our military bases AT ALL.Why would they PAY US... for the benefits THEY PROVIDE?(Now let's consider OUR ability to manufacture during war)American Military strategy dating back to the Monroe Doctrinehas understood the value of a secure American hemisphere forthe security of our manufacturing during war. Mexico's locationmakes them one of our most strategic allies for our defense.Our enemies dream of the opportunity to station military bases(and missile silos) along Mexico's border that could destroy ourability to manufacture during war. So barricading the border ofour most valuable ally (and calling them "rapists & murderers")would be the dumbest military strategy since... EVER.
14 | Christopher Kurz | 1540363412650350_1540393595980665 | Funny how Hillary says Trump will "rip families apart and deport them".....Ellian Gonzalez hardly left his family on his own free will as you and Bill applauded the men ripping him from a closet at gunpoint.......
15 | Roman Gonzalez | 1540363412650350_1540388152647876 | a proven sexual predator and lecherous old man...who bragged about his assaults and about barging into the TEENAGERS DRESSING room when they were half naked and naked...as he bragged about it on a RADIO SHOW...HE IS NOT BAD...HE IS A SEX OFFENDER...I HEARD
16 | Rick Shrum | 1540363412650350_1540400859313272 | No one with a brain is talking about "bad hombres".All the SJWs and other dorks are going to obsess on it, and hash tag the hell out of that phrase, thinking they are being clever."Bad Hombres" is an old expression - its like saying "bad dudes".Stop being silly about the smallest of things.
17 | Joe Barry | 1540363412650350_1540546799298678 | If u vote hillary u shall sit at home and watch as the immigrants rob/loot/bomb/kidnapped/rape/this county with only a baseball bat to protect yourself . Cause she took your second amendment right. All the while paying there bills
18 | Pegi Davis | 1540363412650350_1540404055979619 | The major problem with these debates is Trump!!Time and time again he cannot focus- stay on topic!!His brain has a problem following along with what's being asked!!
19 | Carol Andersen | 1540363412650350_1540465032640188 | I can't imagine any Hispanic voting for this man unless, they have a very low self stem or never heard his comments regarding Mexicans or Hispanics in general.I'm Hispanic, and I'm voting blue!
20 | Tim Stangl | 1540363412650350_1540519939301364 | Good news for all Americans If Trump wins he will build a wall to keep illegal immigrants out. If Clinton wins Mexico will build a wall to keep illegal immigrants out. Sounds like a win win solution for anyone with wall building experience to me.
21 | Kathleen Keefe SantaMaria | 1540363412650350_1540582809295077 | I dont think anyone was talking about that...who cares...it is sad that you concentrate on a word rather than looking at what she had done
22 | Monica Buchholz | 1540363412650350_1540388149314543 | I just want to know what she snorted up her left nostril before show time. Why can't she use a tissue and how come she thought it was a good idea to shake anybodys hands with her snot covered hands???? So gross just imagine if she does that kind of gross to the leaders of other countries, no wonder they don't respect her. She is NASTY.
23 | Thomas Cassidy | 1540363412650350_1540391119314246 | Wow...Hillary Clinton tells the world our nuclear response time. Reckless, just like her emails...#HillaryForPrison #ExposeClintonCrimes #WikiLeaksBlock
24 | Wayne Miller | 1540363412650350_1540421555977869 | Well paying off more rebels 1.6 billion and planing to pay more is beyond childish. It's stupid 911 never forget. Vote for Hillary you vote for terrorist
25 | Glenn Dawson | 1540363412650350_1540411425978882 | There are non documented folk who are registered to vote and Clinton thinks that‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶ think about that for a second ‚Ä¶. Non US citizen voting for president ‚Ä¶..Sounds like her open borders policy is in place already ‚Ä¶.Looks rigged to me......Clinton asked about deleted emails after they were subpoenaed talks about anything else ‚Ä¶Hillary is confronted about recent Wikileaks proof that she pays people to incite violence at Trump rallies. Hillary goes uhhh...but Russia, Putin, espionage, blah blah blah. In her own words, what difference does it really make... Clinton up in arms about toddlers and guns but promotes unborn babies being murdered so they can not become toddlers she claims she cares about‚Ä¶ Clinton claims Trump would be a puppet for Putin but Clinton has already given Russia increased power over the uranium market whilst she was in charge of the state dept ‚Ä¶. Clinton was also instrumental in getting companies such as Cisco, Google, Intel among others to enter Russia and guess who has a huge investment in this?? That‚Äôs right Putin‚Ä¶. So looks like we all know who would be the puppet ‚Ä¶ And that before we even get to her campaign manager..

1 | Beatriz Saldivar | 1540332522653439_1540336362653055 | The only "nasty" person is Trump! Let's build a wall around this very, very, "nasty" Trump. And have his ill Trump Foundation pay for it!

3 | Alexis Gonzalez | 1540332522653439_1540332762653415 | Tonight Hillary confirmed she will send troops to Syria, where Russia is playing a huge role. I refuse to vote for the woman who will send in  my brothers and sisters in arms to ANOTHER middle eastern conflict to get slaughtered! Wasn't Iraq enough for you, Killary?! üò°üò°üò°
4 | Dean Stevens | 1540332522653439_1540337309319627 | I seriously can't believe she boo-hoo'd over the 4yr old boy in the ambulance, yet defended a woman's right to abort a child just days (DAYS) before it's due date?!
5 | Jennifer Reilly | 1540332522653439_1540348629318495 | So this is what we want in a president? Someone who resorts to grade school name calling. That's not presidential that's juvenile bullying. That's not leadership, that's an embarrassment.
6 | Sharon Frank | 1540332522653439_1540348012651890 | That's the pot calling the kettle black!  No matter what the outcome is of this election, his reputation is tarnished forever. he has branded himself to be a bully and an obnoxious, arrogant, jerk with no class, no matter how much money he has. and I'd like to tell him where he can take his golden toilet and stick it
7 | John Quattrocchi | 1540332522653439_1540334795986545 | And? She is. Funny how the mainstream media ignores all the stories from former secret service agents that once protected her. How mean she was to them or o others in front of them. Or how she treated the k-9 units that made sure people weren't trying to blow her up.
8 | Mark Arbes Jr | 1540332522653439_1540339879319370 | Wikileaks was brought up in tonight's debate. When Hillary Clinton was confronted about the contents, she didn't deny they weren't true, she instead, started whining about Russia. If I was Trump, I would've responded with, "At this point, what difference does it make," where the emails came from? Doesn't change the fact that they're true.

Welcome To America !
11 | Gail Chirichella | 1540332522653439_1540344629318895 | She is nasty. Just watch the videos of her out on the campaign trail attacking the ones that don't agree with her. Oh, wait mainstream media isn't allowed to show her as the real Hillary.
12 | Gilda Ortiz | 1540332522653439_1540338042652887 | Trump took Hillary on and proved she has no clue especially on our economy and Trump was best on policy actually Brilliant .  She ripped off Haiti and refused answering corruption in her Foundation!!!Hillary would not address being  caught paying thugs to cause violence at Trump Rallies this was caught on film under cover..... Huge crime.      *** Hands down Trump's best debate"PS why should Trump say I will concede to the presidential results!!!! What about voter fraud !!! I mean why should he close his options when others in the past conceded then turned around and had voter re count... Nixon and Gore did it !!!!! Remember?
13 | Joan Kuhn | 1540332522653439_1540353875984637 | Call it like you see it! Great description knowing what she has done for 30 years and still doing! Liar, thief, fake, devil in sheeps clothing, expecting others to accept her husband's proven past to be forgotten really? What an example of the 1st family no way " Nasty Woman with dirt and blood on your hands !
14 | Cat McCracken Simonson | 1540332522653439_1540341505985874 | Every time I see someone interviewed about being a Trump supporter lately, they say that they also respect women. Trump himself claims that he respects women....sounds like lies to me. If you respect women, you should respect all women. What a joke this has all become. It's just really sad that children are being brought up around so much hate....what great examples of what it means to be an American.
15 | Shandana Khan | 1540332522653439_1540338269319531 | Honestly can't believe these have been presidential debates. More like a show of elementary school bullying. Although this one was more civil than the last two.
16 | Bryan Dombi | 1540332522653439_632358200259274 | I always vote Democrat and was prepared to vote for Hillary but after watching all three debates and looking at all the facts and the overwhelming amount of corruption it is clear I must vote for Donald Trump. I hope others like myself can see past party affiliations and vote for the better candidate based on policy and integrity and that person is Donald Trump by a long shot!
17 | Bud Waters | 1540332522653439_1540347622651929 | NBC so partisan. Easy to read the reporters were only focused on "how bad Trump" did. The media sucks. Who's paying them off? Follow the money people! It IS rigged! Just listen to these paid parrots...I mean reporter analysts. Sorry...you didn't fool me
18 | Deborah Kaplan | 1540332522653439_1540375149315843 | How is it that Trump and his supporters are so concerned about women's rights and lgbt rights in foreign countries (clinton foundation contributors) but have no qualms about overturning women's rights and lgbt rights in this country? You trump supporters are being manipulated by some of the oldest tricks in his manipulators arsenal. It's called Flippin the script. He has you focusing on her corruption (look at what bill did, look at her foundation, look at her emails, look at bengazi, not what i did) to detract your attention at what he still does. You're being played.
19 | Tory Riley | 1540332522653439_1540371959316162 | Trump the only guy who lost a billion of his own money and NASTY KILLARY lost 6billion of the tax payers money and NBC would rather ride the political agenda train and discuss what someone has said vs what someone has done.must be another group of Clinton foundation members
20 | John Quattrocchi | 1540332522653439_1540336289319729 | I love all these comments tonight btw, most are people who are just fed up with the liberal bias. Its marevelous. Almost lends some truth that the polls aren't as truthful as theyd want us to believe.
21 | Steve Meyers | 1540332522653439_1540369942649697 | There are still tons of Trump supporters who not only think he's still a viable candidate, they actually think he's going to WIN. it's so puzzling to me. I don't know if it's denial, stupidity, a refusal to read any news that doesn't come from Breitbart or some fringe site. It's mind-boggling. I have no idea what they're going to do after the election. Trump's loss will be only slightly less humiliating than Mondale's in '84. Will they riot? Start conspiracy websites trying to get to the "truth" of the rigged results? Clearly reality isn't a huge factor in their lives. From a purely objective, people-watching stand point, it's absolutely fascinating to watch unfold.

Is this the best you can do NBC?? Give me a break!! Trump 2016!! Oh yeah and your polls lie too because everything I have seen posted on fb shows that Trump is leading not her!! So do what you do it will all come out in the wash. God will have his hand in this!

5 | Lee Street | 1540314385988586_1540428479310510 | Well we for Certain know who the puppet was when she was the Secretary of State.We also know who the puppet will be if she wins the white house. She's done been bought and paid for by the enemies of the US.. All one has to do is check the list of countries that donated millions to the Clinton Foundation,..
6 | Joe Barry | 1540314385988586_1540553209298037 | Get ready for a LANDSLIDE Trump victory in America, it's going to be a huge win for American sovereignty and the final death blow to Globalism (new world order).. The Majority of Americans are voting for Trump because they are sick of business as usual in Washington DC and the American people are fed up with the criminality/corruption that runs rampant in the Federal Government.. There is a Monster vote just hiding under the surface and election day it's going to be seen, so many closet Trump supporters.. Trump = American sovereignty and Hillary Clinton = Globalism (new world order)... Anyone voting for Clinton seriously needs their heads examined.. Trump is the real deal and is not a Puppet to the Globalists. That's why the Zionist mass media, both political parties and the entire Globalist establishment are attacking Trump in every direction possible... The Globalists are losing control every step of the way and the desperation is extremely obvious.

Please pinch me to wake me up because this cannot be happening.
8 | Sharon Hayes Libardoni | 1540314385988586_1540687315951293 | Did anyone notice that when Hillary was confronted about Wikileaks's regarding open boarders her reply was " If you read the next line you would see that I was referring to energy."???? She just admitted that the emails are in fact hers. üëç

10 | Robert Keyser | 1540314385988586_1540345462652145 | Easy answer... Hillary is the puppet. Selling political favors and being owned by foreign governments. Trump owes nothing and no favors to Saudi Arabia or other forewign governemts like the Clinton's do. The pay-to-play Clinton's
11 | Danny Corso | 1540314385988586_1540338559319502 | She took 145 million from the Russians. Sure, there is no receipt for the uranium ... but that's not how The Clinton Crime Family does business.

15 | Renee Michelle Dias | 1540314385988586_1540400832646608 | Does anyone notice all events , campaigning , and debates Hillary never wears a American Flag pin on any of her outfits . That should be a warning to all American people that she isn't for the people but only for her self and power .
16 | Jorge W DeQueiroz | 1540314385988586_1540604625959562 | yeah blame russia ... Everything that comes out of hrc's mouth is a lie (emails, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Haiti, clinton foundation, you name it). No trust in hrc, msm and cronies. Have to closely follow the voting mainly when hrc is running for president together with her record of evil doings. What BO/HRC have done to Chelsea Manning, Snowden and Assange show we have no rights and freedom of the press and speech. We live in a totalitarian State of a kleptocracy that blames all our problems on Russia in public and in private settles uranium deals with them.I'm no great DT fan but the allegations of outright msm pro-hrc PR campaign and avoidance of hrc's destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice, lies and scandals published by Wikileaks which are far more grave make me certain that the only way to see the truth is to alternate power.
17 | Gary Basham | 1540314385988586_1540396812647010 | The goal is to persuade undecided voters. They have all heard about Benghazi, Bill Clinton, her health, the lie about the 12 year old rape victim, emails, super predator, etc. they already have a formed opinion on those topics. What people want to hear is policy, substance, and how he would govern. Why keep repeating the same crap? It's not like any of that is a new revelation. Trump failed to address issues or answer the questions he was asked. You are an idiot if you think bringing up stuff that has been repeated for years will convince ANY undecided voters. It's not an insult contest.Of course his ignorant supporters think he won because he made them happy. He did NOTHING to attract any undecided voters. Therefore, he really lost. He cannot win the election with ONLY uneducated white voters. It's mathematically impossible.
18 | Alexis Gonzalez | 1540314385988586_1540320049321353 | Hillary Clinton just said tonight, that if a day before my daughter's birth they found something wrong with her, I had the "right" to rip her out in pieces. She was born in that time frame that Clinton would still allow abortions. THAT IS truly deplorable!

2 | Alex P. Reed | 1540282255991799_1540290022657689 | He can lie all he wants, but he can't hide from the video that clearly showed him making the "retarded" gesture towards the disabled man, and his supporters laughed at it. Sickening behavior.
3 | Sasha Bens | 1540282255991799_1540286629324695 | "You gotta see this guy"Everyone that saw that knows he was mocking a disabled reporter. Donald Trump is a pathetic, insecure, immature,disgusting little man and he makes me sick. He's an embarrassment. What kind of person does that? He is everything I teach my children not to be...even kids know this is wrong!
4 | Roxann Kasparian | 1540282255991799_1540287745991250 | He did everything he said he didn't.  What is wrong with that man. Does he not realize there are things called video and audio?
5 | Daniel Walek | 1540282255991799_1540293169324041 | Did anyone else feel like Mr. Dump didn't answer any questions and just blamed everything on Obama who is somehow the same person as Hillary?
6 | Forrest Quay Roberts | 1540282255991799_1540325862654105 | Just curious, but why are politicians the only thing that people don't want veterans in? Everyone likes Trump because he isn't a "career" politician, but what does that even mean, really? Would you prefer a doctor who wasn't a "career" doctor?
7 | Joseph J Martin | 1540282255991799_1540283369325021 | She avoided a lot of the questions by answering with something that sounds smart but doesn't actually answer the question.  30 years of experience and some people still buy her bs. She could cook a live puppy in boiling water and some people would still come back with "oh, well Donald Trump is racist etc.
8 | Lorrie Hutsell Sterling | 1540282255991799_1540293712657320 | Of course he did.   We all saw it. It was broadcasted worldwide!!! But he denies facts -- Gaslighting in its glory.   It's what he does. Because you actually check ---- let's him believe you are saying it's possibly he's telling the truth. So he's winning the fight.  And escapes any responsibility.   You can't deal rationally with a compulsive liar.
9 | Elthon DeCastillo | 1540282255991799_1540291005990924 | A guy mocks a disabled, Clinton manipulates, in her emails, national security. But, mocking a disabled is worst than someone manipulating national security because, here's the kick, we are in more danger a person mocking a disabled, than someone manipulating our national security. That makes a lot of sense! LOL
10 | Tim Huber | 1540282255991799_1540291765990848 | Trump DID NOT mock the disabled reporter for being disabled. Trump uses those SAME EXACT hand gestures ALL the time, with NON disabled people.Numerous videos exist showing such. Media LITERALLY has the masses blind.Mostly the liberal left and Clinton supporters.
11 | Emily Fiumara | 1540282255991799_1240060589399013 | Trump lost every last shred of respect from me the second he mocked that disabled reporter. I am a teacher who is also Special Education certified, I have worked with a number of amazing children with special needs, and I have a wonderful 8 year old niece with Autism with the most beautiful soul. Unfortunately, she is mostly nonverbal and cannot always self-regulate her behaviors. This does NOT make her less than anyone else, and she is so very much more than her disability. I would do anything to protect her from small-minded, insensitive people like him. In my opinion, his lewd comments, actions, and behavior regarding women, and his unacceptable and unbecoming behavior during the debate tonight are just further proof of what a despicable being he truly is, there is no denying that. I will never, in good conscience, be able to support him. No hate towards anyone who does support him, that's your choice, this is why we have democracy, and I respect that.
12 | Teri Hollis | 1540282255991799_1540287595991265 | How about fact checking Hillary? Like the fact she stated she abolished the Iranian nuclear program when in fact it is only a freeze. How about her peeps saying that Trump did not bring up the wall when down in Mexico.. when in fact the Mexican President even acknowledged they spoke about but would not pay for it.
13 | Gail Chirichella | 1540282255991799_1540291095990915 | We want wiki links...We want to see the wiki links on Hillary. You must show these to the American people! Or is Hillary off limits...yup a rigged election. One side election!
14 | Idin Ahangar | 1540282255991799_1240080066063732 | NBC as medium is just a shameless joke.How dare you advertise for or against anyone?I don't support any of the two but you should be ashamed of yourself.
15 | Tory Riley | 1540282255991799_1119060524798107 | I guess abortion,aka justified homicide,aka murder is small apples to NBC,but don't you dare mock a disabled person because we will hold you accountable and turn the other cheek to partially born murders!
16 | Joe William | 1540282255991799_1540313875988637 | Anybody that makes fun of cripple people will get their day" it's called karma! This man is so disgusting it makes me sick! Anybody that votes for this man should get their heads examine because you're stupid for voting for this idiot!!!!
17 | Jack Griffin | 1540282255991799_1540309355989089 | If Trump had no chance of winning the media would not be working so hard to attack him... So the media is controlled by democrats.. now consider this: 1) Democrats attacked Trump Supporters in San Jose CA 2) Democrats blocked roads to Trump rallies 3) Democrats broke store window in Texas because they had Trump signs in the windows.. 4)Now firebombs... Democrats have imported the violence and politically instability of Mexico and the middle east into America.. They have desensitized American youth to where they don't see the hypocrisy of committing violence on people they accuse of violence.. We Republicans use words free speech and the law.. Democrats have descended into mob rule and terrorism... The new America
18 | KeithDeb Newbrook Collins | 1540282255991799_1540300842656607 | He's made mistakes . said things he shouldn't have. he is not a diplomat.Hillary on the other hand has. blood on her hands. 30 years of polished political correctness with very little achieved. a foundation that's crooked. emails that disappear, is it enough lie and corruption for you yet or shall i go on.she is business as usual...do you seriously want 4 more years after the 8 we've had to live through. or do you want a business man to have chance to try to make America great again who owes no one and is not business as usual.thems your picks. pick one.devil you know or the devil you don't.
19 | Tim Regler | 1540282255991799_1119070818130411 | This should be the deal breaker for every person that claims to have been respected my mother and father. They didn't just spend their careers teaching people with disabilities, they taught them that they were deserving of dignity and respect. This alone disqualifies Trump from the office. I can't imagine a worse way to sully the memories of my parents, than to vote for this man.
20 | Daniel N Patty Britton | 1540282255991799_1540285479324810 | The liberal media uses this because they have nothing else, Hillary sucks and they can't fix that so they run everything into the ground....
21 | Clint J. Everest | 1540282255991799_1540288702657821 | Hopefully after Hillary wins the election in a couple weeks, Trump and the remaining republicans can get the help they desperately need.  Many people are saying this.  Very sad.
22 | Susan Muncy | 1540282255991799_1540300455989979 | If you ever saw the reporter he was supposedly mocking, you'd know that man's disability didn't allow the type of gyrations DT showed - he is very stiff. Plus DT has used those gyrations at other times when the subject was a situation rather than a person. So don't believe the knee-jerk first reaction/explanation by MSM. Wait for the truth to be published.
23 | James Sautter | 1540282255991799_1240114636060275 | This was one of those headscratching moments from him in the debate.  Lol.   We all saw the video of him mocking that reported shortly after it happened.  Yet he denies it over and over.   Lol....wow.  He's either lost touch with reality, or he's an idiot for lying about when there is video proof.
24 | Allen Valentine | 1540282255991799_1767810373459474 | However, at this point, if you‚Äôre still a supporter of Donald Trump, here‚Äôs what you really are: You‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs cemented your place in history as an individual who we‚Äôre all going to look back upon with disgust and shame because you were ignorant enough to support one of the worst presidential candidates in United States history. This is a man who‚Äôs: Mocked a man with disabilities. Attacked the parents of a fallen American hero. Belittled POWs and the war record of Sen. John McCain. Lied about how much money he raised for veterans. Called a former Miss Universe ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù and fat, telling his Twitter followers to find her non-existent sex tape. Accused an American-born federal judge of being unfit to do his job because of his Mexican heritage. Likely avoided paying taxes for nearly two decades. Called most Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, even though that‚Äôs not remotely factual. Lied about seeing ‚Äúthousands and thousands‚Äù of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. Lied about getting a letter from the NFL complaining about the debate schedule. Tried to exploit the death of an African American woman in Chicago to say that‚Äôs why black voters will support him. Found the ‚Äúbright side‚Äù to tragedies because his poll numbers tend to go up. Settled with the Department of Justice after his company was found guilty of racially discriminating against minorities. Has cheated on at least one wife. Was just discovered on video admitting that he not only tried to cheat on his current wife, but he attempted to do so with another married woman. Had his first wife publicly say that he did nothing when it came to raising their children until they were old enough to talk business. Tweeted that women should have expected to be sexually assaulted when they mixed males and females together in the military. Said he wants to target the families of terrorists. Stated that he wants to ban an entire religion. Praised a Russian president who obviously hates the U.S. and Americans. Encouraged the Russian government to commit espionage against Americans. Insinuated that another Republican‚Äôs wife was ugly. Tried to implicate another Republican‚Äôs father in JFK‚Äôs assassination. Sought out the help of former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes after he was fired following multiple allegations that he had sexually harassed women for years. Made Breitbart‚Äôs Steve Bannon one of his top campaign people. Had a former campaign manager abruptly resign after a report came out linking him to pro-Russian groups that were directly trying to undermine U.S. policy in eastern Europe. Called Carly Fiornia ugly. Has said climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese ‚Äî then denied saying it. Was a leading conspiracy theorist when it came to the racist-driven birther conspiracies against President Obama. Dismissed nearly eight years of accusing the president of not being an American with a less than 30 second statement where he didn‚Äôt apologize for any of it. Tried to blame Hillary Clinton for his racism. Re-tweeted anti-African American propaganda created by a white supremacy group. Played dumb about knowing who former Grand Wizard of the KKK David Duke was. Skipped a presidential debate because he was scared of a moderator. Has, on several occasions, suggested he finds his daughter attractive. Called a husband doing things like changing diapers and helping with the children, a man ‚Äútrying to be the wife.‚Äù Has said he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. Said he can‚Äôt release his tax returns because they‚Äôre currently being audited ‚Äî even though the IRS said that‚Äôs a lie. Feels he has the right to sexually assault women.
25 | Andrea Capone | 1540282255991799_1540323349321023 | How anyone can vote for a presidential candidate that mocks a person with a disability....the lowest of the lows..don't get it.

"I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now," Donald J. Trump  said during the final presidential debate.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Carl Rosenbaum | 1540263229327035_1540264429326915 | If the elections are rigged, as attested by Donald Trump, then the Republican Party needs to explain how/why....- The GOP controls both Houses of Congress- The GOP has the majority of State Governorships- The GOP controls the majority of State Legislatures- The GOP controlled the Supreme Court up until Judge Scalia's deathMaybe the GOP should also explain why they believe the country is going in the wrong direction, since they are in control!!!
2 | Luis Argueta | 1540263229327035_1540264815993543 | Trump won't commit to accepting election results because he is the Biggest Loser!!! In his eyes, everything is Rigged!! So ridiculous!!!! SMH!! #neverTrump #IAmwithHer #Hillary2016
3 | Shawn Thomas Griffin | 1540263229327035_1540271842659507 | This was the most damaging answer Trump gave in tonight's debate. It made him sound like a pompous arrogant child. It's his way or the highway. Either he wins or he throws a monumental temper tantrum. Pathetic.
4 | Rob Swart | 1540263229327035_1540272989326059 | Trump must be defeated by such a large margin that his supporters get the clear message that his hedge on insurrection if he loses would be suicidal!!!!! Stand up for our Democracy. Trump is the only person who refuses to accept the verdict of the people. Just suggesting this should bring charges of treason. God save America.
5 | T Elliott Cato | 1540263229327035_1540268135993211 | Attention Visitors: The Trumpanzees are currently in the midst of one of their frequent poo flinging fests.

6 | Alberto Gomez | 1540263229327035_1540275342659157 | Can't wait for the election to be over, once he loses, then we will star our own campaign, this time against him, his company, his products and everything he represents, disgusting, nazi, bigot, liar #nevertrump
7 | Terry Elwood | 1540263229327035_1540266452660046 | Before the great deludge of media comments that will undoubtedly target Mr. Trump and his refusal to accept the outcome of the national election, I would like to point out that Mrs.Clinton was not asked that same question, and therefore will not be held accountable to the same criticism of not accepting the election results. Just an observation, just a point to ponder. No comments or questions necessary
8 | Manuel Bonilla | 1540263229327035_1540276395992385 | He Choke Basically on every question that was ask always trying to change the Subject so he wouldn't answer about the Issues what a poor sportsman, Then to top it off he said "Nasty Woman" That hung him up my 3rd grader has better Vocabulary then he does Smh.....
9 | Jack Shayle | 1540263229327035_1540267585993266 | I was very happy that Mr. Trump brought up concerns about the voting process. If a company doesn't regularly look at it's process to ensure it's healthy, it gets sick. Some are saying it's sacrilegious to question and doubt the voting process when there is strong evidence there is a problem. Questioning the process of democracy is democracy!!!
10 | Shannon Malcom | 1540263229327035_1540273352659356 | He'll "keep us in suspense." LOLOLOL dude don't flatter yourself. I, for one, am not on pins and needles worrying about the baby fit he's going to have when he loses.
11 | Mary Slagle Reed | 1540263229327035_1540303185989706 | How do you people that work at NBC think that Hillary outlined her plans for America?  She did not give complete answers on immigration or really anything! The government already spends billions each year supporting all these illegal immigrants who have children over here! While our elderly can barely keep a roof over their head, go without food, running water, electricity, and medications, we have illegal immigrants that are living wonderfully for free and sending the money they make here(which they receive in cash) back to their home country!  They don't pay federal income taxes yet file them using stolen social security numbers and get back thousands each year!!!
12 | Blanca Padilla | 1540263229327035_1540314225988602 | He is not a leader, he likes to lead people on. What a disgrace of a man! He is not even worthy to be called a pussy, that's an insult to the word! #wearenastywomen
13 | Tom Baxter | 1540263229327035_1540333122653379 | Clearly Secretary Clinton won the 3rd Debate. Trump stumbled, lied, and tried to talk over her but it didn't work. Secretary Clinton was ready for him, while Trump seemed shocked that She went on the attack sooner than he thought she would. His refusal to acknowledge that the election was legitimate if he lost was profound! This country is a beacon to the world because of our voting process, people are killed because they want to show the purple finger which shows they voted, and for Trump to cast doubt on our voting process is UNAMERICAN! A great punch in the face which Secretary Clinton gave to Trump was when Trump was talking about building great buildings and she interjected, yeah, with Chinese Steel!!! Devastating! Everyday that goes by Trump shows he's not qualified to be President!
14 | Rob Atkinson | 1540263229327035_1613352492298871 | According to my source - Electoral-vote.com, I've been following them since Election Year 2008 - if the election were held today Clinton would win in a landslide 339 to 181. Those are hard numbers to refute.
15 | Deirdre Merz | 1540263229327035_1540278045992220 | I am so tired of NBC and their biased opinions. What happened to unbiased reporting?  What happened to people watching the news, getting the facts and forming their own opinions. I've watched NBC for many years. I've been watching Lester Holt's evening news broadcast. But after the debate tonight watching Lester, Chuck Todd and Savannah Gutherie bash Trump over and over? I'm done. I don't need or wNt your opinions. What I do need and want are the facts.
16 | Yvette Venturino-belken | 1540263229327035_1540326819320676 | It is because of all the illegal voting going on. The states have proof of that. Let us wait to see what other corrupt things we find out about the Clinton Campaign has done. I understand his answer and what was behind it.
17 | Friday Brenner | 1540263229327035_1540276195992405 | This whole election is messed up hillary rigged her primary and is rigging the rest too. the media is bias. the people may have to rise up and overturn the election if she is given it. we the people have that right amd duty.
18 | Warren Murray | 1540263229327035_1540275829325775 | This is what happens when an outsider comes into politics, politicians know that they are accountable to the people for their actions as well as their employment. When you allow rich, greedy, power hungry tycoons to rise to the top, they feel they are accountable to no one and if things don't go their way, they would rather destroy the government than preserve it. It's time to put trump and his sideshow to rest, send them back to the corruption, hatred and racist villages they came from. Enough is enough !
19 | Shelley Margaret | 1540263229327035_1540303549323003 | Were you guys all over Al Gore too, when he left us hanging for weeks as we recounted all the pregnant chads? We just learned this week that the Democrats have been bussing in people from out of state to vote fraudulently for the last 50 years (on tape), and Hillary's campaign has been paying people to cause violence at Trump's rallies,  and colluding with the media - how can we not feel this election is rigged??
20 | Robert Keyser | 1540263229327035_1540300282656663 | He did not say he would not either. Also for the record since Hillary seems to have also forgotten this... Al Gore in 2000 rescinded his concession and it took the Supreme Court to step in to determine the outcome of the election because of the crap going on in Florida with the counting of the votes.
21 | Carrie Kissel | 1540263229327035_1613348915632562 | He didn't refuse...he simply said he would wait and see.  Biased reporting.... None of us should accept the election if Hillary Clinton is president.. She is a criminal who should not be allowed to run
22 | William R. Ball | 1540263229327035_1540298269323531 | As soon as Trump said he might contest the results, but would wait, and keep us in suspense, he should have been disqualified immediately. That was unacceptable. This idiot has to get of of here. He is a vile, disgusting, pathetic, and disgraceful human being. And he needs to take his puppet, the pathetic idiot, Mike dense Pense with him.
23 | Kcired Rerref | 1540263229327035_1540266625993362 | To his defenseMr Trump said " he will wait" we're not there yet......nothing wrong with the answer because he knows he is going to win
24 | Craig Roberts | 1540263229327035_1613352632298857 | I would not blame Trump for not accepting defeat. a humble simple " congrats you won" be good enough by me, he could said "Hell no ! " I would cheered him on ..BUT, They are crazy to think if Hillary wins I will or should get behind her....
25 | Sharon Dube | 1540263229327035_1834509483427187 | The Donald does not answer anything straight forward and to a committed conclusion!  He can not even do what is standard practice in an election. Shake Hillary's hand and wish her luck when she wins the presidency and be a good loser and thank the people that supported you while you (Donald Drumpf) embarrassed the American people! You are not the businessman you claim you are but then you call Hillary a liar. We need to know the issues that is going to make it better for the "little people" that make minimum wage and did not inherit millions of dollars from The Daddy.

1 | Tina-Marie Clark | 1540230615996963_1540250242661667 | Fact checking:Donald-9 times  Hillary- 0 times Yeah this seems legit!  NBC I have to say that you used to be my favorite news channel. But you prove tonight you are in the pocket of the Democratic Party. How is one supposed to vote in good conscious and not truly know all the facts? I can only pray that this country will vote based on past experiences and not media hype!

3 | Brian Lizotte | 1540230615996963_1540246662662025 | I thought fact checking presidential debates was supposed to be done on both candidates? Nothing But Clinton News only seems to want to be bias and promote propaganda. Clinton lied during the debate as well. Like has she said " 33,000 killed last year at the hands of gun related homicides " Fact is that 75% of those 33K are suicides. Not homicides
4 | Sultan Mahmud | 1540230615996963_1540248022661889 | Donald Trump is now a bigger threat to US democracy than ISIS will ever be.This is truly terrifying - no really it is. It could start a blood bath or mini civil war. Get him under control GOP!Since the Civil War the US has been a stable democracy. Trump is threatening to undo centuries of democratic culture and norms.He just destroyed himself - but in doing so has sown dragons teeth.Don't be surprised should monsters spring forth.
5 | Miguel Menendez | 1540230615996963_1540295369323821 | I do not care if Donald Trump called a woman fat. I do not care if he tried to sleep with a woman or if he likes "beautiful" women. I care that he sent a plane to pick up 200 Marines who were stranded after desert storm. I care that he supports our police officers and first responders. I care that he supports guns and standing behind our military. I care that he supports the death penalty and is AGAINST abortion. I care that he supports enforcing immigration laws. I care that he wants to destroy radical Islamic groups. I care that he supports COAL. These are things I care about. Him talking sexually about women does not bother me. Were they mean words? Yes. Were they words spoken in PRIVATE? Yes. Have you ever talked to your friends about the opposite sex in private and said things? I'm positive all of you have. But, News Flash!! Women have been sexualized for centuries!! Jay-Z, Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne and every single other rapper helped establish that platform, but people are ok with music blasted all over the radio degrading women. Ever heard of Victoria Secret? Or their fashion show? Ever heard of Hooters? People are ok with that too. Until all of these things are different, women will be viewed this way. Your precious Obama couldn't change that and Hillary can't either. I feel sorry for the women Donald has belittled and said terrible things about. But I'm still much more offended by what Hillary Clinton has DONE over what Donald Trump has SAID... PERIOD!!!! So Trump doesn't do well at the debates, maybe he even sounds childish and incapable. But he is speaking the truth! Just because he's not a polished politician like Hilary or Obama doesn't mean he's unqualified to be president. He cares for this country, not growing the size of his pockets. That man has so much money he could never spend it all. He gets NOTHING out of being president! I'm standing for the man accused of saying mean words. I'll never back a woman under three different scandal investigations, possible murder at Benghazi, and the secretive email scandal which has been nothing but lies from the beginning. Trump 2016!!!
6 | Sheryl Ann | 1540230615996963_1540251109328247 | NBC grow up and stop protecting a bigger liar and that is Killery.. You fn know she belongs in jail.. stop stereo typing a man that wants to bettter our country , she has had plenty of chances to fix America..
7 | Clay Barber | 1540230615996963_1540250412661650 | Here's some FACTS for you clowns as they are PROVEN... HRC killed Americans and jeopardized the security of the nation...check that!
8 | Becky Swinney | 1540230615996963_1540252065994818 | His wife told Anderson Cooper Trump apologized to her and he said he did not. Hillary was right he lies about his lies about lies. He shouldn't talk about anyone's looks when he always looks like he is constipated. He never has anything nice to say about anyone or anything except himself. He is very negative and depressing
9 | Daniel S Burnham | 1540230615996963_1540244755995549 | Hey everyone Madonna is offering to give blow jobs to Hillary voters. Another role model for Michelle's girls. Then Nicki can teach them the words to Stupid Hoe. Nothing to get shaken to the core about. Oh Madonna says she swallows.
10 | Don Tober | 1540230615996963_1540358839317474 | So ehat.......couldn't care less what he said.  I care about actions. Hillary's actions are despicable & horrific.  She should be hung as a traitor for her actions & in-actions. Trump hasn't had an opportunity to do anything against this country nor it's citizens.........I will give him that chance because he is the ONLY current choice to Save America at this time.
11 | Debra Pence | 1540230615996963_1540352932651398 | Stop fixing the election I watched your tapes Trump didn't ! How about the economy! How about the babies üë∂ that Hillary thinks it's ok to kill. Stop being so one sided. Your job is to report the facts! Please do your job. Hillary is a criminal she needs to be in prison.
12 | Dave Holgate | 1540230615996963_1540585352628156 | Trump and Pence lied NUMEROUS times in their debates. When you have no shot at winning or solutions for problems facing this country, you lie and mislead and the dumb among us go along with it. So sad in this country that so many even consider this guy for office..
13 | Christian Varley | 1540230615996963_1540492682637423 | Look Once Again about 70% or 80% of people on this newsfeed seem to like Trump more and think he won the debate.... Hes always been pretty cool with the media in the past, so if he wins, I'm sure it will work fairly well for everyone.... Wether its Trump or Hillary who wins, its just another President.... We have seen many, before, and we'll probably see many, many more !
14 | Jamie Lowder | 1540230615996963_1540250662661625 | He's not allowed to have an opinion you people are so dumb why don't you focus on the criminality of the Clinton people are sitting in jail for far less and for the same crimes that she's committed you're not focused on that you're brainwashing is not going to work a majority of the people commenting here are against you get it together or you will be eliminated as a new source eventually because you will be untrustworthy
15 | Ross N Windy Montgomery | 1540230615996963_1540656722621019 | Who care!!! Hillary will leave men who served our troops in Benghazi to die. I am done watching NBC don't care what tv shows you have that I like it will no longer be watched in my house. You people are so hung up on what he said about those women when in fact Bill did the very same thing as governor in Arkansas but that is ok. I want to hear about her emails she will dodge that one until she is dead and can't speak. Let's talk about Benghazi does NBC not care about the men and women fighting for our country. That is the news.
16 | Robert Mendez | 1540230615996963_1540578752628816 | I watched on two other networks but my friend commented here the other guys had the same results on facts...and clearly he was struggling and throwing a political tantrum rather than offering anyone a reason to support him.
17 | Tom Gonzalez | 1540230615996963_1540585972628094 | Not only did he say it, his comments on their looks is a tacit admission that he engages in this type of unwelcomed behavior. Just not with them because they aren't attractive enough.
18 | Barbara Cipriano | 1540230615996963_1540247342661957 | Fact: the media's tactics are very old and boring! And don't work! 59-63% is the numbers for Trump's win in the polls. Notice major channels didn't open any polls? Did only fact checks on Trump but no one else? Let's translate: The boy from Queens swept the floor and pulled a Yankee Sweep!
19 | Joey Jordan | 1540230615996963_1540286609324697 | Actually he said what he said and what he said is no I did not try anything with her look at her what he was saying that is not my type and a lot of men look at it that way and honestly I seen her I would not have messed with her either. And you see what all his wife's look like don't you and you think a man that goes for women who look like them is going to go for anything else. Now I am not saying this to support Trump but saying you are twisting his words to make it say something different an idot could understand what he ment but seems a Democrat can't
20 | Heidi Rosvall Desmarteau | 1540230615996963_1540346569318701 | Fact Check...NBC is so over the top for Hillary it's not even news coverage they provide but feeble attempts at brainwashing
21 | Kathleen Keefe SantaMaria | 1540230615996963_1540599935960031 | Nbc will nitpick bevause they are on hillary's payroll...ask Savannah. She is one of the reporters that is on the list that met  hillary and signed up to be a sheep herder
22 | Christy Dawn | 1540230615996963_1540625592624132 | You are putting words in his mouth. He said look at her! That could mean anything from her composure, attitude, demeanor and yes her looks! She can be beautiful on the outside but ugly on the inside and ugly does have a way of baring its ugly head! So yeah, look at all of them!
23 | D'rick Johns | 1540230615996963_1540600949293263 | But the reason Trump keeps getting fact checked so vigorously is nobody can believe he continues denying things that have been seen on video hundreds of times. It's mind boggling that he denies things like actual video doesn't exist.
24 | Melinda Robertson Sickal | 1540230615996963_1540580342628657 | Please, you are making yourselves look really bad, the way you keep pushing this whole Hillary agenda, people hate her, she's a traitor and anti American..you will lose ratings if you don't stop this oblivious manipulation tactics you are using by twisting words around.. I'm telling you, it doesn't look good for you...forewarning you üòî
25 | Steve May | 1540230615996963_1540279579325400 | Question... If a white man is beat up by a group of black men and they spray paint his car with BLM would that be considered a hate crime? If a group of men set fire to a mosque would that be considered a hate crime? If people beat someone up because of their political beliefs would that be considered a hate crime?

Hillary Clinton said Donald J. Trump encouraged Russia to hack Americans. He just suggested they "find" ones from when she was secretary of state.

1 | Trent Silver | 1540219169331441_1540221465997878 | Trump won this debate for us! He is not only presidential but he is showing us what his plans are on the economy, immigration, and national security. He got under her skin and her memorized lines will not save her tonight. VOTE for TRUMP IN NOVEMBER!
2 | Mark Arbes Jr | 1540219169331441_1540227719330586 | Wikileaks was brought up in tonight's debate. When Hillary Clinton was confronted about the contents, she didn't deny they weren't true, she instead, started whining about Russia. If I was Trump, I would've responded with, "At this point, what difference does it make," where the emails came from? Doesn't change the fact that they're true.
3 | Ronnie Miller | 1540219169331441_1540227889330569 | Most shocking statement of the third debate: National debt is 70% of GDP. The only way to bring that down is by growing the gross domestic product(GDP). When Regan was president it was 4%. GDP is the monetary value of all the finished goods and services created in the United States. Without jobs our nation is doomed and I'm not a gloom and doomer. I've only been alarmed once before when I read the book "Conquer the Crash" in early 2000s. He said the banks would collapse and they did.We need to stop exporting jobs out of the country. I use to support all free trade treaties. I was wrong. I Love cheep stuff from China and Mexico but it it's sort of like fast food. Taste great but it clogs the arteries. GDP is the heart of the United States.
4 | Joey L Lowe | 1540219169331441_1540230639330294 | Well if it's Russia China or goldy locks no one should be able to breach.it should be more secure and her leaked emails on her private server started this whole thing.now our FBI our cia our homeland security is a joke.were getting hacked left and right and TRUMP will stop this crap also
5 | Tammy Agee | 1540219169331441_1540229792663712 | Excuse me but let's not get too picky with semantics. She's an American and they would have to hack her account in order to 'find' them. Everyone knew what he meant! And that is spying on Americans, whether it's Hillary or anyone else! If you want to only give truth when it's word for word, let's listen to the tape and see how it was said and what he meant by it! She might have gotten a word wrong, but she wasn't lying! So there you go!
6 | Makarand Dusey | 1540219169331441_1540279262658765 | And how do they 'find' the emails? If some of you stop and think, you might find the answer. To make it easier, here is the answer...by hacking. In most countries, suggesting and inciting such activity would be deemed ' treason'. This baboon needs to be in jail.
7 | Kathy Kelly Hurley | 1540219169331441_1540236759329682 | They'd have to hack her emails to find her emails, so yeah, she is right - he invited Russia to hack her emails. Pretty close to treason, isn't it??
8 | Ginger Taylor | 1540219169331441_1540227292663962 | HITLary wants to protect toddlers from Gun Violence or accidental shootings but is happy to kill an unborn fully developed fetus right before it is born. Hmmm that does not make sense, no sense of morality at all.
9 | Don Poyas | 1540219169331441_1540230779330280 | Chris Wallace didn't ask about ObamaCare, law and order, the inner cities, school vouchers, FBI quid pro quo, sanctuary cities, Benghazi. Stop dithering over whether Trump wants to support Clinton. Al Gore sued when he lost! Trump wins our vote.
10 | Silvia Loza Albarracin | 1540219169331441_1540224172664274 | When he said he would like to see more emails, he is encouraging them, jackers are going to keep doing the same only if people is searching and praising their work
11 | Kenn Kerr | 1540219169331441_1540507945969230 | Hillary Clinton reminds me of the bad guys in Scooby Doo. In every episode they would say... if it wasn't for those snooping kids, I would have gotten away with it. You notice she never denies what's in the Wikileaks email dumps... she just quickly blames Russia and glosses over the major crimes and negative issues coming out in the emails. If someone broke into Hillary's house and found a dead person and then reported it to police... she would scream "but he broke into my house" acting as if the dead body means absolutely nothing. She must really think we're all as stupid as those who vote for her... Sorry Hills the rest of us aren't that stupid.
12 | Chad Hance | 1540219169331441_1540243662662325 | No wonder sites like Breitbart are destroying sites like NBC. Trump not only said what he said tongue-in-cheek, but he said it well after her server had been taken off line. Even the so-called truth check up there says "find" because you can't hack something that doesn't exist.This is just another sneaky way to push this Russia/Putin/Trump propaganda. How about some reporting on Hillary and her people's connection to Putin and Russia?
13 | Cyndi Bailey Cain | 1540219169331441_1540233719329986 | She will not work to help the American people!! NBC is crooked!! Look what she has done and you can only bash him!! Really that scared!!! We the American people will have him as President!!! You can't stop us!! Change IS HERE!! I vote boycott your news!!!
14 | Heidi Johns | 1540219169331441_1540234809329877 | Fox News  is presenting the truth - non (media) bias - this is insane!!! NBC -So obviously owned... you're a media source/ responsible to provide the information equally. You are not to try and sway votes. If you don't think the American people see this, we are not blind-check yourselves!
15 | Sammy Johnson | 1540219169331441_1540232652663426 | I do not believe it...the NBC "Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda" actually fact checked something said by Ms. Clinton.
16 | James Goodman | 1540219169331441_1540248862661805 | So this major news venue, and Hillary, in politics for 39 years, actually. Think in any way shape or form, THINK. RUSSIA. Was awaiting donald trump to say the word hacking?   SERIOUSLY?
17 | Brian Racer | 1540219169331441_1540229609330397 | I really don't care who hacked who, the real issue is that if she didn't do all these things their wouldn't be anything to find
18 | Sandra Armour | 1540219169331441_1540366922649999 | Russ , trump is only telling you what you want to hear. He isn't going to do anything about jobs. He hires immigrants, he uses china steel, he out sources where his clothes are made. The trade deals, yes, they hurt workers but thr republicans help pass them and Bush did too. The democrats tried to bring back jobs in Obama's first term by reducing taxes. The republicans voted against it. The Chamber of Commerce is all for out sourcing. Trump is only out for himself.
19 | Thomas Sullivan | 1540219169331441_1540392455980779 | Trump has acknowledged not paying taxes for 18 years and using Chinese steel to build his Trump Casino in Las Vegas because it is "legal" under current laws that he says Hillary should have fixed already. Does anyone believe he would change these laws if he were elected???
20 | Kelly Purcell | 1540219169331441_1540387675981257 | Actually, I just watched the clip again and Hillary said Trump encouraged Russia to commit espionage against America.  He suggested the find emails of the Secretary of State. That is the definition of espionage.
21 | Joshua Glaspie | 1540219169331441_1540498565970168 | NICE TRY NBC! But were not falling for this little BS post trying to prove your not colluding and completely controlled by the DNC, corrupt establishment and the Global Elites! Too little too late! #MAGAüá∫üá∏
22 | Cyndi Bailey Cain | 1540219169331441_1540230475996977 | The news is bashing him!! From the very start after the debate!!! Nice try Trump will vote Trump!! This is wrong you do this!! Bash her and what she has done!!
23 | Texas Liberal Veteran | 1540219169331441_1540450832641608 | Trump screams lies, and we sort them out, one at a time.Clinton slips on a matter of nuance, and we quickly correct her.Excuse us, folks: asking Russia to hack into emails is different from inviting Russian hacking. I think. Um...  probably.
24 | Bill Garrison | 1540219169331441_1540336182653073 | NOT SO FAST...Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said during the third presidential debate, ‚ÄúWe at the Clinton Foundation spend ninety percent ‚Äî ninety percent ‚Äî of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.‚Äù Fact-Check: FALSEIndeed, Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúninety percent‚Äù claim is false according to her troubled charity‚Äôs own tax filings...Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute, Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large, and author of Clinton Cash said the Clinton Foundation has spent as little as SIX PERCENT of its total income on actual charitable endeavors.‚ÄúIf you actually look at the numbers of their filings and 990s, that‚Äôs what it indicates,‚Äù Schweizer said last month in an interview with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily. ‚ÄúThe Clinton Foundation will say, ‚ÄòWe assisted or facilitated in 100,000 kids getting immunizations.‚Äô Well, okay, what does that mean? And they don‚Äôt really tell you. They don‚Äôt really explain to you how it works.‚Äù‚ÄúSo the number is absolutely correct, that six percent goes to other charities,‚Äù Schweizer continued. ‚ÄúThe other 94 percent is in this stew of marketing, and management, and travel expenses, and sort of all these obscure things, that it‚Äôs really hard to dissect what is the end result of that 94 percent being spent.‚ÄùWhat‚Äôs more? Political analyst Sean Davis, the co-founder of The Federalist and a former adviser to Sen. Tom Coburn and Gov. Rick Perry, examined the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs 2013 tax filings and found that ‚ÄúHillary Clinton‚Äôs non-profit spent more on office supplies and rent than it did on charitable grants.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Clinton Foundation spent nearly $8.5 million‚Äì10 percent of all 2013 expenditures‚Äìon travel,‚Äù Davis contends. ‚ÄúNearly $4.8 million‚Äì5.6 percent of all expenditures‚Äìwas spent on office supplies.‚Äù
25 | Peter Paul Hoffman | 1540219169331441_1540473432639348 | In law it stands that if evidence is not obtained though due process of law (warrants), (depositions) (testimony under oath) then any  evidence is  not admissible in courts of law..

That's not what he has said before: http://nbcnews.to/2e9IQRJ

1 | Trent Silver | 1540187686001256_1540189619334396 | Trump will rise above all this bias media hate and make America safe, and great again! #Trump2016 Hillary is way too weak, criminally crooked and vulnerable to run this country! She is funded by countries that hate America and our people. #HillaryForPrison
2 | Alexis Gonzalez | 1540187686001256_1540190669334291 | I just looked at about ten different polls on who won the debate tonight. The ones that said Clinton had won were already closed. The polls that were still open had overwhelming votes for Trump, and they were still pouring in. Hmmmm ü§îü§îü§î
3 | Dalton Barnard | 1540187686001256_1540192156000809 | Literally the "Nothing But Clinton" network. NBC is garbage.
4 | Donna King | 1540187686001256_1540194156000609 | Once again....the main stream media thinks the American people of stupid....I DO NOT BELIEVE A WORD THEY SAY NOR DO I BELIEVE THEIR SO CALLED " FACT CHECKS"....SMOKE AND MIRRORS...its not working any more...they are running scared now...it is true, Did the America people finally wake up?
5 | Jacob W. Smith | 1540187686001256_1540202805999744 | Whether or not illegal immigrants pay taxes is irrelevant. An illegal immigrant is and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT. I am married to a hispanic woman whose family came here and earned their citizenship the right way. They are all voting for Trump. They feel that if they didn't get a hand out then why should anyone else. Because of his stance on taxes. His stance on equal wages. His stance on immigration being done the right way. His stance on fighting back against ISIS. His stance on the second Amendment. His stance on boosting the economy by creating more jobs instead of more handouts. His stance on term limits for career politicians. His stance on checks and balances in our government. So why are you voting for Hillary?
6 | Mahdi Calanle | 1540187686001256_1540189472667744 | That awkward moment when Donald Trump says "no one respects women more than me" and then calls Hillary "a nasty, nasty woman".LOL
7 | Harvey Nicholson | 1540187686001256_1540196622667029 | I'm not voting for Trump or Clinton -- each are horrible candidates in their own right--but the constant bias against Trump shown by NBC is an absolute disgrace. For example, who cares if Trump said ICE endorsed him last week when it was last month--they still endorsed him!
8 | Tejuanna Points | 1540187686001256_1540194439333914 | He also said he Never mocked that handicap man..lol this guy does know a thing called internet and videos? Now who's the "Liar"?
9 | Dustin Grant | 1540187686001256_1540211322665559 | Plenty of Trump fact checking going on by NBC. Is NBC going to do any fact check reporting on Hillary's scandals that are being revealed by Wikileaks? NOPE!
10 | Jennifer Rapson Collings | 1540187686001256_1540194399333918 | Trump is never going to have the MSM, esp. NBC News on his side. They will always pick an angle that appears to hurt him, in favor of Hillary. If it wasn't the whole "won't accept the results of the election" thing, it would be something else. His only shot at winning is to get beyond the MSM spin and get a populist wave that doesn't give a hoot (wanted to use a more profound word) about whatever the MSM says.
11 | Rachel Romansky | 1540187686001256_1540199916000033 | Oh, THAT Putin? I didn't realize you meant THAT Putin. Of course I know Putin. Our relationship is HUGE. He's a good man. But not that bad Putin. That one is a bad man and has done terrible things. Bigly.
12 | JoeBob Whitaker | 1540187686001256_1540196239333734 | Wow! NBC..not one-sided are we!...how about a fact check on what Hillary said about the Clinton foundation. ...that's a easy one for you!.
13 | Nathalie Ben Kely-Scott | 1540187686001256_1540216035998421 | Why are you inly fact checkingHim!!?? Have u just all together abandoned trying toHide how bias media intentions now!? How can the American public make An informed decision w all the media already choosing for us!!!???
14 | Teresa Norton | 1540187686001256_1540199712666720 | Trump calls her a murderer because 4 soldiers died! Well his friend Putin has murdered hundreds of thousands of people!!! He wiped out a city!
15 | Selena King | 1540187686001256_1540217409331617 | NBC you really use your news to promote Hillary! Don't be deceiving. He said he doesn't know him. He has met him. Is different then knowing someone.
16 | Valerie Bluett | 1540187686001256_1540197252666966 | Trump disputed something he said in the debate tonight before it was even over. He talks and never listens - let alone REMEMBERS what he just said.
17 | Adam Letterly | 1540187686001256_1540364445983580 | All of these Trump supporters claim media bias when shown Trump contradicting himself. Either they have the crappiest memories, or they follow him like a cult. I am beginning to think more often that it's the latter.
18 | Travis King | 1540187686001256_1540193372667354 | REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
19 | Robert Keyser | 1540187686001256_1540338889319469 | Maybe we should look at what Hillary has said before... It would take a life time to figure out what she really support and does not. She changes he stance to suit who she is talking to for the current 15 minutes.
20 | John Paul Knight | 1540187686001256_1540229465997078 | Trump did very well he kept his composure until she started insulting him like the media has!! Oh and did u see what happen when he brought up the violent video about Hillary supporters trying to ruin his rallies that was ignored very quick by Hillary!!
21 | Jose Escobar | 1540187686001256_1540213715998653 | Come on media, stop throwing facts at these Trumpkins. They can't handle it and throw temper tantrums like their man child of a candidate.
22 | David Selph | 1540187686001256_1015604658586431 | NBC. Once again you prove yourself to be a biased "news" organization. Many of your "facts" are half truths or just plain misleading. Where are your investigations of the lies Hillary has been spinning?
23 | Jesse Barber | 1540187686001256_1540507752635916 | The media is harping on Trump because he said he's not sure if he will except the results of the election, but we have the Democratic Party on video talking about intimidation inciting violence at Trump rally's and rigging The election. I want to see a full investigation into those allegations.
24 | Mitchell Giddens | 1540187686001256_1540228105997214 | NBC... we all know, and realize that the Clinton Foundation bought you, and your opinions years ago, but you should try being real journalists again sometime. It's what you actually wanted to be isn't it?
25 | Tyler Caban | 1540187686001256_1540423849310973 | So, let me get this straight. Because he mentioned Putin in a tweet, that means that they're best friends? How?! All he said in that tweet was "Do you think Putin will be going to the Miss America Pageant in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?" How does that prove them knowing each other at all?

2 | Justin Ozmore | 1540120619341296_1540165772670114 | It's crazy every post on NBC'S pages are fact checking Trump only. Not a single post fact checking anything Clinton said. Both Parties suck, but this is obviously rigged people.
3 | Jim Balfanz | 1540120619341296_1540158879337470 | He spoke the truth when he said, She talks a good game and then disappears until the next election. He is NOT a politician, but a businessman who does have a plan..... She has a "plan" which to to destroy America.

6 | Alexander Xochihua | 1540120619341296_1540175102669181 | As soon as the debate ends, NBC Hosts immediately highlight every bad Trump moment that they can imagine.  NBC, you're no longer a news source i trust.
7 | Brandon Boger | 1540120619341296_1540169036003121 | Nbc is a joke, media is corrupt. Not one bad thing said about Hillary, the women who belongs in jail. Trying to make Trump look bad but Americans are going to see through this.
8 | Brittaney Gresham | 1540120619341296_1540161082670583 | Umm, NBC you are lying. Unions for ICE members endorsed him. Two separate organizations that represent Border control personal did in fact endorse him. I do believe there is a police related union that did as well
9 | Tammy Goyne | 1540120619341296_1540165846003440 | Media is biased. Hillary may be a better speaker but she's made a life out of it. She lied all night and avoided several things. She is crooked and she is dirty.
10 | Elena Gabriel Pizano | 1540120619341296_1540185519334806 | I'm sorry; but where are Hillarys "fact checks"?  I am not for either candidate, but I would like for NBC to be fair and treat both candidates the same!
11 | Rex Tilton | 1540120619341296_1540160286003996 | So you want to vote for Hillary Clinton. Understand she will open the immigration flood gates. Think what you want, Russia has zero respect for her and that will lead to some very big problems if she is elected. I don't like what Donald Trump says but his words don't come close to the Clinton's actions. Hillary Clinton will appoint very liberal Supreme Court Justices and that will lead to a disaster. Think about this when you are in the ballot box. She will keep Obama Care and it is a disaster.
12 | Jimmy Christopher | 1540120619341296_1540183872668304 | NBC news has lost me forever they are so BIOS and it shows, I am so amazed THAT A NEWS MEDIA IS THIS BAD, I would rather never know the news then to listen to it from this media source
13 | Lloyd Bradshaw | 1540120619341296_1540165929336765 | What¬¥s the purpose of the mainstream media? Saying that the press exists to inform, educate or entertain is like saying Apple corporation¬¥s primary function is to make technology which will enrich our lives. Actually, the mass media industry is the same as any other in a capitalist society: it exists to make profit. Wake up America and check out the facts for yourself!
14 | David-Julia Schachter | 1540120619341296_1540173312669360 | I'm a bit confused about Democrats and this irresponsible liberal news network criticizing Donald Trump for saying "he will look at the results at the time" instead of promising to accept the results of the election. Hillary said that was unprecedented. But didn't Al Gore contest the election with Bush resulting in a Supreme Court case?
15 | Daniel Oliver | 1540120619341296_1540169346003090 | Seems like nbc news is behind hillary.. all reporters down trump and praise killary..get reporters that look at both sides and not biased opinions themselves.. keep it equal for the American people..
16 | Madeline Walker Arsement | 1540120619341296_1540179932668698 | NBC keeps saying Trump wo'nt accept who wins. That is not what he said, but they will keep saying it. It's very scary when these idiots on NBC dissects Trump, but hasn't said a word about Hillary. She is a liar & a criminal. If they agree with her, they are too. They are controlling this.They need to stop lying about what he said.
17 | Jenn Baker Rock | 1540120619341296_1540166599336698 | Why is it that we are not fact checking her this is why he says it is rigged. Not a fan of either but it is insane how much the media is controlling this election
18 | Johanna Scheffer Notaro | 1540120619341296_1540163432670348 | They sure as hell did. But would not trust your facts anyway. And Hillary saying that 90% of there foundation goes to charity is one big fat lie. They spend millions of dollars just on travel alone. She deserves a oscar for lying so well.
19 | Andrew Veale | 1540120619341296_1540170482669643 | I'm not voting for either, but how can you truly report as an "unbiased network" if you don't fact check the other candidate?
20 | Vanessa Marie Evans | 1540120619341296_1540206909332667 | Wow NBC..way to show the voters Trumps "outrageous" claims about you might actually be true! Good job. Thousands are now repeating the big caption thinking NBC proved Donald Trump lied about ICE endorsements...while NBC laughs. To be clear people NBC merely explained Trumps answer...even Hillary knew what he meant or she would have attacked "espionage"...I am still hurting over that rolling laugh...gotta love the irony.
21 | Lloyd Bradshaw | 1540120619341296_1540169656003059 | I do not trust mainstream media and NBC your bias is so apparent it's scary. The people are starting to notice big time you better change your tactics. (-:
22 | Ginger Alyson | 1540120619341296_1540184379334920 | Federal agencies themselves may not endorse candidate but somehow a sitting POTUS not only endorses a candidate but actively campaigns for he using taxpayer funds??? The First Lady and the VP endorse and campaign for her using taxpayer funds as well. I have no problem with saying " I endorse her" but I have a major problem with using taxpayer funds to campaign for her. Disgusting!
23 | Shawna Y Raymond Gallardo III | 1540120619341296_1797153910570585 | Wait NBC let's be a little more clear....Trump said ICE endorsed him last week. YOUR fact says it's falseA union representing some ice agents endorsed him last month but Feds cannot and do not endorse...Is the false statement the time period? This is a false statement because it was three weeks prior to what he said. So he's wrong....
24 | Fred Bressette | 1540120619341296_1540175649335793 | She insulted him about his comments on women but when asked about her husbands treatment of women she talked about trump again she didn't answer half questions just insulted and dodge questions. The news still talking about trumps treatment of women guess they didn't hear the question about how bill treated women. Oh wait it's the news nothing can be said about the ClintonsIf she raises taxes on big corporations and 25% of them leave the country and take jobs with them how does that help American families.
25 | Mandie Verlinger | 1540120619341296_1540180069335351 | Are we to assume by these "fact checks" that Clinton was 100% honest? And then to assume that you are 100% nonbiased? I'm so confused on  why there aren't any fact checks on her? Which would also lead me to assume that your fact checks are one sided and not fair to both parties. The voters deserve better.

11 | Troy Torrison | 1540141789339179_1260551770663727 | Hillary was a very competent Senator and a highly effective Secretary of State. You know what you're getting. A popular leader who works hard.

15 | Becky Haynes Cox | 1540141789339179_1540147986005226 | NBC SUCKS! So freaking biased! They need to go ahead and merge with maybe the National Equirer. Same level of true "news" reporting
16 | Elizabeth Earl | 1540141789339179_1540144392672252 | He is a traitor trying undermine the foundations of our country, a peaceful transfer of power.
17 | Sharon Cobb | 1540141789339179_905832139546770 | Hillary believes it is a woman's right to make her own medical decisions. The government has no place telling any woman what to do with her body. This ain't the handmaids tale.
18 | Geneva Calender | 1540141789339179_586461761537763 | She was so tired of his lies. She knows democrats and republican both will support her. I'm so glad it's finally over. Madam president. I'm so proud of you.
19 | Sonny Saggar | 1540141789339179_1168075636587809 | The candidate who disrespects our country's conventions does not deserve to win. That moment will swing many of the undecided. In fact, it'll lose him the few remaining educated supporters he had.
20 | Janet Hischer | 1540141789339179_1540144619338896 | So why did she say she would do away with coal mines and coal miners she's doesn't care nothen about the coal fields she's a liar and a thief

FACT CHECK: Donald J. Trump said his accusers' claims have been "largely debunked." They have not.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Brittaney Gresham | 1540115406008484_1540140206006004 | Are you going to fact check Hillary? Or only Trump? Your bias is showing again.
2 | Zachary Stinson | 1540115406008484_1540141282672563 | Claim: nbc does fact checksThe truth: nbc is a bunch of democrat operatives pushing opinions as "facts"
3 | Brenden Donaldson | 1540115406008484_1540141646005860 | If those woman are not lying why did they wait to come out? Why not come out years ago? When he was a TV star? Or a powerful business man? Or why not come out when he started to run for President? Why wait until the 11th hour?
4 | Brandon O'Guin | 1540115406008484_1540162022670489 | Hey, NBC, not one "Fact Check" on Hillary, huh? Yeah, because, you know, she hasn't been a serial liar for decades. I'm sure everything she said in the debate was 100% truth. Lololol #YourBiasIsShowing
5 | Raja Wahid | 1540115406008484_1540140979339260 | How to interpret constitution = Hillary won & Trump was confused and stuck in his own logicsSecond amendment = Hillary wonIssue of  women right to abortion = Hillary won & Trump tried to avoid the question with blah blah #womb #NinthMonthIssue of immigration = Trump still want the wall and says drugs are coming and want the immigrants out & Hillary not in flavour of deportation of 15 million ppl but in favour of boarder security and deportation of violent pplDo you condemn the interference of Russians = Tumps was yes and again saying don't know Putin & Hillary said it's been reported by 17 state agencies that Russia is meddling the election process but the results is 60% trump and 40% HillaryTaxation system and economy = Hillary, minimum wage, equal wage, tuition free college and new jobs and big corporations pay more taxes and TRUMP didn't responded the question but stuck with NATO and Saudi Arabia and other alleys to pay for security #HillaryWonGroping women by Trump and issues of Clinton = trump said all the women are paid characters by Hillary campaign and Hillary quoted all the instances and exposed his nasty character of groping women #HillaryWonClinton foundation = 11 million are the beneficiary Hillary responded & added that CF has the highest rating and raised 30 million for Haitians #HillaryWonElection is rigged = Trump said that he will decide on Nov 09 whether to accept the results or not and further added that media is corrupt and it makes the election rigged. Hillary said that trump don't trust either FBI, RNC, Judges etc and it's his mindset #HillaryWonIraq and ISIS, boots on the ground?= Hillary said that we will support Iraqi army and don't want boots on the ground but will do arial attacks on ISIS and will look for political solution. Trump still wants the element of surprise in his attack on enemy which is illogical and will result in collateral damage #HillaryWonSyria and Aleppo = Trump added Syrian refugees are troggen horses however, Hillary said that we should go for political solution and added won't stop refugees and will work with Muslim communities!! #HillaryWonNational debt = Trump said will increase GDP growth increased by 5 to 6% which seems to be unrealistic however, Hillary said that she will add nothing to national debt and added will make the big corporations to pay more tax #HillaryWon
6 | Wayne Garrison | 1540115406008484_1540166446003380 | Thanks NBC, so nice to be bombarded by the nonstop Hillary love. It's so nice to see the constant bias. I see not one single feed where you fact checked Hillary. Looking good douchebags.
7 | Cory R Courtois | 1540115406008484_1540143066005718 | Not for nothing, but are you going to vet any of Killary's comments like this? I've seen none. Ahhh, for the good old days when journalists weren't shills for a campaign.
8 | Gene Manning | 1540115406008484_1540142382672453 | I am done with the media...they are so biased! NBC is the worst ever
9 | Katrina Howard | 1540115406008484_1540162866003738 | My husband has said far worse things in public than what trump said behind closed doors. Just saying. Most men talk nasty and if you don't believe they do , then go hang out on a construction sight or with iron workers. They will teach you.
10 | Marsha Goldman | 1540115406008484_1540211422665549 | I would like to remind Donald Trump that the system is not rigged instead you might lose because you are unfit, unstable, unprepared, a bully, a tax cheat, a pervert, a racist, narcissist, shallow, a person that have no respect for women or disabled people and heartless.
11 | Cory Bordelon | 1540115406008484_1540206199332738 | NBC you have yet to post one negative thing about Senator Clinton. Yet everyday it's constant negative talk against Mr. Trump. It's clear where your political views lie. All I ask is if you're going to do "fact checks" do them for both candidates!
12 | Danny Corso | 1540115406008484_1540172662669425 | NBC runs this story and doesn't cover WikiLeaks and pay to play and 33,000 deleted emails and the doesn't touch the James O'Keefe videos that show Bob Creamer and others sighting they are paind by the DNC and the Clinton campaign to insight violence and riots at Trump rallies. Nor does NBC cover the fact that Bob Creamer visitied the White House 960 plus times including 87 times with Obama. They run these accusations as if they are true . The mainstream media is in the tank for Hillary.
13 | Carol Ann Haworth | 1540115406008484_1540147552671936 | Think about it, they are coming from a foreign country with different customs and language. They will not be ready to work as soon as they get here. They will be on social programs.... ALL ON YOUR NICKEL! Go vote! And think about your paycheck.
14 | Robert Kalakewich | 1540115406008484_1540190262667665 | Oh, but they have... NBC wonders why no one watches their "News".... Fox News eats NBC "News" for lunch... and the ratings prove it!
15 | Joey Holasz | 1540115406008484_1540172679336090 | NBC doesn't fact check [her]? This is the meaning behind biased "rigging." Not voting for either. America loses regardless but the media hasn't helped any.
16 | Angus Macgregor | 1540115406008484_1540155372671154 | How can everyone including NBC call this a fair election process.And I wonder what Equador was threatened with to shut up wiki leaks.
17 | Brian Young | 1540115406008484_1540141826005842 | The fact that no charges were ever made years ago, and they are just now coming out, and no legal charges being made...that largely debunks the political maneuvers.
18 | DeeDee Taylor | 1540115406008484_1540190512667640 | Ugh, NBC enough already. We are capable of fact checking ourselves. They both lie like rugs, stop pushing your liberal agenda.
19 | Sherry Armstrong-Seifert | 1540115406008484_1540161432670548 | PLEASE for the love.... People!!! It's not about Trump fondling women??? If that's the VERY worst thing the Clintons can dig up on DJT!!!? The list for Clinton would go on & on... Don't fall for the media misleading you off track! Remember, her lies, Benghazi, Pay to play, inciting violence, showing no remorse for placing U.S at risk & breaking the law countless occasions!!!
20 | Christ Mendoz | 1540115406008484_1540246395995385 | NBC how much $$$ did you give to Hilary üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ because it's about the control of the human race Hillary has a lot of baggage as well say the thruth about how much you are giving her! About her lies!!  Real journalism...
21 | Robin Lyon Rivas | 1540115406008484_1540155599337798 | It was shown in the wikileaks that the DNC paid people to be violent at the Chicago rally.  Is it so far fetched that they paid women to come out to falsely accuse Trump?
22 | Tony Lee | 1540115406008484_1540245595995465 | Non bias as always nbc. This is why people are starting to hate our news outlets. When youre just a puppet for one candidate how can the public take you serious.
23 | Laura Michaels | 1540115406008484_1540168639336494 | NBC is a liberal media outlet, no surprise here they, just like CNN never report anything negative about Hillary. Hell, I'd love to debate her on these same topics, especially with the economy and national debt.
24 | Rachel Danielle Recca | 1540115406008484_1540140682672623 | Family coming out and saying they are lying doesn't count as a debunk? Emails begging for jobs doesn't count? Eye witnesses don't count?Wow....
25 | Linda Spott | 1540115406008484_1540180559335302 | Thanks, NBC! I knew this all along! Now if someone could just look at the released list of Trump Russian businesses, & verify it that would make my day!

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Marisela DlCruz Bebawi | 1540119409341417_1540124409340917 | Thank you donald for handling the presidency so easily to Mrs. Clinton.She just had to let you talk.
2 | Carol S D'Agostino | 1540119409341417_1540130426006982 | You know it's not in his nature to accept defeat gracefully he's going to blame everyone involved of rigging the result, he's like a petulant child
3 | Erica Feit | 1540119409341417_1540133016006723 | You're disgustingly wrong in your efforts. If Clinton loses, Trump wins. That is a serious tragedy. While I do not believe Clinton is the answer to our country's problems, Trump points to our demise. Until our country can effectively elect an official from neither dominant party and only elect based on morals/beliefs/history of the candidate, we will not see the change we need. Protect us from Trump by voting for Clinton.
4 | Beulah Marie | 1540119409341417_1540132619340096 | Hillary is actually the Puppet Master and her strings run throughout Washington. Trump will cut those strings and return control to the American people!!! üá∫üá∏üëåüèªüëçüèª
5 | Julien Aklei | 1540119409341417_1540157506004274 | It feels so wrong how NBC instantly starts bashing Trump the second the debate is over. They shouldn't host the debate if they can't be impartial.
6 | Allison Tysinger | 1540119409341417_1540138202672871 | Idiot. Proves it every time he opens his mouth. Bigly? Everything is a disaster? I know you are but what am I? Schoolyard retorts? He speaks like a 3rd grader. The only delusionals are those who think there is anything presidential about him or his character.
7 | Adam Allee | 1540119409341417_1540161382670553 | NBC!!! You people are liars!! He never said he would accept or Deny the results. He just didn't answer the question. You guys are manipulating!!!!!
8 | Cindy Robinson Malott | 1540119409341417_1540180216002003 | Trump has a point. NBC is clearly trying to use their media platform to sway the voters towards Hilary; however, people aren't swayed that easily and can see through it.
9 | Debra McKenzie | 1540119409341417_1540184619334896 | Ok...my two cents..I'm so tired of the media deciding what the headlines tonight should be...and implanting thoughts and ideas in their audience heads to sway them to think their way....Yes ...Trump didn't say...first time in History...that he COULDN'T promise to uphold the outcome or decision of the Election ....Could you Blame him??? This isn't like any other election in our history!! Lies..distortion..you name it....I wouldn't promise either...WHO KNOWS what else can take place in 20 days....I applaude him for his HONESTY....he simply said...I DON'T KNOW...Now..their condemning him for it...GOD HELP US PLZZZZ!!!Ted Cruiz...Bush.....etc etc...pledged and then bc of unknown unforseen incidents took place that caused them to go against their principals..higher than that of a pledge changed their support...Point is....don't pledge if you don't know!
10 | Michelle Morris-Rainer | 1540119409341417_1540166132670078 | Oh get over it media!  So he said he might protest the election. He has a right!  The crooked Clinton machine and years of crooked democratic votes it's his job. It's Americas job to hold these nasty lying political thugs accountable! This includes bought and paid for MSM hacks like you all at NBC too!
11 | Angelica Avila | 1540119409341417_1540157339337624 | Why wasn't Hilary asked the same question. And why did they let her get away with avoiding most questions they asked her. Especially regarding her foundation while she was Secretary of State and did so many favors for companies who made huge donations?
12 | Jim Harris | 1540119409341417_1540164032670288 | Nicolle Wallace you do not speak for all Americans. It's rigged because the News that I grew up watching doesn't give us the news anymore. NBC news spins to what their agenda is. I will no longer watch NBC shows or what they call News. I done with what they are peddling.
13 | Star Amber Nelson Ridsdale | 1540119409341417_1540177679335590 | if the election is rigged then the American people should revolt. That is unacceptable in our free world where votes count. Killary is a liar and does so without hesitation. That is her scariest trait.
14 | Frank Rakich | 1540119409341417_1540195109333847 | And I see nothing wrong with Donald Trump said keep you in suspense The way the whole campaign is been run look at Hillary Clinton how corrupt all the people that she has paid to say bad things about Donald Trump look how corrupt she has been through the whole campaign why should it be traditional at the end when the whole freaking thing is been nothing but out to get Donald Trump to discredit him when it should've been all about Hillary Clinton and all the mistakes and lies that she pulled
15 | Karolyta Marberry | 1540119409341417_1540215109331847 | It's funny how Hillary will not give any truthful answers. When it comes to those emails. And just look at how mad she is getting. If there was nothing to those emails. Then it should not bother her. This women is corrupt just like the government is. The reason the government doesn't want Donald Trump to win. Is because he doesn't play by there rules. Food for thought.
16 | Ryan Morefield | 1540119409341417_1540140169339341 | We need a body language expert to exam her while Mr Trump speaks on the millions of voters that shouldn't be registered to vote
17 | Linda Jackson | 1540119409341417_1540241845995840 | Hillary got caught with her earpiece in the other debate so someone can't tell her what to say. She had to take days off before this debate to memorize her lies, I mean lines. 30 years in politics and she has gotten NOTHING DONE. She couldn't even handle the Secretary of State position and had to step down. Thousands of emails destroyed and lying under oath. Unbelievable people will cast a vote for her.
18 | Violet Lee Eubank | 1540119409341417_1540189729334385 | well the DNC will play that up big and ignore her flip flop on several issues as he pointed out. But then we know she says what she thinks people want to hear and he just says what he things and feels. Rather have honesty than pleasing lies.
19 | Bonnie Cantrell | 1540119409341417_1540156902671001 | It is not up to him it's up to us the people it doesn't matter what he said the people are going to do what they want they aren't going to let her become president and everyone knows and they are trying to get him to talk the people down. People r done with the corruption with the government and the media. They should take that into consideration when they do and say what they do. It's sad that they think he can control the people he just gave them a voice. Damage control would be for them to prosecute her.
20 | Nancy Vestal | 1540119409341417_1540220529331305 | Well, I wouldn't accept it either, because the DNC is pulling every trick in the book to rig the election, dead people voting, going to homes for mentally ill people and signing them up to vote for Democrats, hiring illegals to give them an ID etc, etc. Why should we trust the results if it goes to Hillary when we know she's trying to derail the election.
21 | Hector Perez | 1540119409341417_1540215025998522 | I watched the comments made by Kayleigh and Jeffrey After the debate. No wonder Trump is a lost soul. If I had these two idiots coaching me to run for president I would have booted them out a long time ago.The one thing I can say about Donald Trump. Your a Duck so get the Quack out of here while you have a chance.
22 | Kana Chandler Lones | 1540119409341417_1540157509337607 | What debate was Nicole looking at. He didn't say he wouldn't support her he said he will keep folks on the edge and will know closer to election time. Lester Holt is so damBias it makes me sick. Get him off the air. Geeze
23 | Tammy Lynn Andrews | 1540119409341417_1540154449337913 | Who would except that woman to run this country. She hasn't done anything for the last 30 years that she's been in politics
24 | Jared Hollis | 1540119409341417_1540182952668396 | With all the apparent fraud being exposed by emails at the highest levels of government why would trump in his right mind say he would automatically accept the results of presidential election.
25 | Matt Levingston Sr | 1540119409341417_1540184149334943 | You people are a bunch of Trump haters and will never change the people's minds especially that Savannah Guthrie she has bad mouth him more than any of them way to go on being objective.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Joshua Duncan Starks | 1540110816008943_1540121662674525 | "Believe" is not "know for certain".Is this a joke?
2 | Zachary Criscuolo | 1540110816008943_1540126256007399 | It says "believe" there is no definite proof! Shut up you liberal loser Chanel, NBC you should be ashamed. Assisting her to win off lying and cheating. What a shame!
3 | Beulah Marie | 1540110816008943_1540122826007742 | Hillary  is actually the Puppet Master and her strings run throughout Washington. Trump will cut those strings and return control to the American people!!! üá∫üá∏üëåüèªüëçüèª
4 | Mark Anthony Ramirez | 1540110816008943_1540122836007741 | They "Believe"???  What kind of "fact checking" is that?As I've posted many times already, NBC "news" fact-checking the debate is like a 5th grader grading his own homework.
5 | Graham Daily | 1540110816008943_1540124659340892 | "Believe" but have no proof either....Fact remains what was leaked are damming FACTS against Clinton. Since we are talking facts and all
6 | Nelly Aldarondo | 1540110816008943_1540129312673760 | NBC only fact checks Trump!! How piggish and disgusting!! It shows how the liberal media is so much pro a woman who is a criminal with evil intent for our country!!!!
7 | Joyce Perkinson Winters | 1540110816008943_1540138632672828 | I don't give a rats azz if they are behind it or what their reasoning for it is. The American people have a right to know the information that is being provided by WikiLeaks.
8 | Joy Holley | 1540110816008943_1540126856007339 | Clinton has political experience. She actually understands this process. She's been to law school. Trump is just flying by the seat of his pants and sadly he's got a bunch of people flying with him.
9 | Andreas Lohne | 1540110816008943_1540131176006907 | You'll notice that not once does she respond to the content. For all of her revealed crimes, she doesn't even respond to them. She just deflects "You were never meant to find out about that and you wouldn't have if not for Russia "
10 | Brittaney Gresham | 1540110816008943_1540122832674408 | One thing we do know for sure, Hillary if she stays on her current position will be sending us to war with Russia.We are not ready for another long drawn out war. I rather have someone who doesn't go around blaming Russia and making the friction worse than someone who is blaming Russia for everything and wants to impose policies even our current administration is against.
11 | Kandi Reimers | 1540110816008943_1540140482672643 | Last time I checked, belief and fact are two different things. It very well may be Russia. But honestly, who cares, are they not clintons words? Is she not trying to hide them? That's what I care about, not WHO exposes her, but what they expose!
12 | Aly Acosta | 1540110816008943_1540196789333679 | At this point does it really matter who the hell is behind it? Wikileaks is 100 % accurate!! She's currupted and dishonest and she will break any rule/law to get where she wants. If it's Russia we should send them a thank you note for at least trying to prevent this Hillary disaster to become President!!!
13 | Anne Garrity-Balfe | 1540110816008943_1540135512673140 | Who cares who's behind it?  The fact is, she used a private unsecured server for government business. And those emails belong to the American people
14 | Ryan Prouse | 1540110816008943_1540129176007107 | Its funny. All you see is Trump fact checks. But, what about Hillary? Don't see any for her? Maybe the media really is on her side. Just sayin!
15 | Bernard Crowley | 1540110816008943_1236410509712674 | As Hillary would say..." what difference does it make at this point " !!.".....whether it was Russia...or some video....don't shoot the messenger.......no one is refuting " the message "...that speaks volumes.
16 | Jean Nadwodny Schacherbauer | 1540110816008943_1540165489336809 | NBC one sided. Why didn't you talk to Mr. Trumps Campaign Manager. So obvious, really.  The Americans really do see what's going on. We Are Not Stupid.
17 | Tony Ocasio | 1540110816008943_1540181872668504 | What bothers me when she said she's going to draw a line in the sand no-fly zone in Syria what are you going to do with Russia if they cross that line are you trying to tell me you're going to start World War 3 over Syria are you kidding me but let me tell you something in the Bible the last days the war will start in the Middle East.
18 | Thomas Cummings | 1540110816008943_1283941101651011 | Does it matter whether it's Russia China Reb party...fact is they were her thoughts ideas and words own up to them and stop trying to spin it...it's really sad that Wikileaks and Veritas has to do the work that our media and honest journalism used to do...SO SAD
19 | Rebecca Madden | 1540110816008943_1540226305997394 | CNN's Wolf Blitzer said just today that they suspect it is russia but are not saying that publicly yet.  in any case, the point is what was in the e-mails. even if it ewas russia, that  does not change the fact that these things happen. wikileaks is very thorough and states that they have never had a mistake in ten years. let us not quibble over who hacked them and forget the significance of the findings. hillary is a master deflector.
20 | Ken Mullins | 1540110816008943_1540210352665656 | I don't necessarily agree with Donald Trump but if you notice the careful wording is that US intelligence officials "believe" that the Russians are behind these hacks. Nothing is said about irrefutable proof.
21 | Kassie Saine | 1540110816008943_1236411049712620 | Believe is not certain. I love that this was pointed out in so many comments. It is also exactly what Trump said, that she can't be sure. I also just love the comment that NBC  doing it's own fact checking is like a 5th grader grading their own homework. NBC and other Media sources are so terrible. It is so crystal clear how bias they really are. Sad, how about reporting on the issues instead of the underhanded bias crap that doesn't amount to anything.
22 | Thomas Gilligan | 1540110816008943_1283920694986385 | The government also thinks Hillary Clinton committed no crimes by using a personal unsecured computer server in her basement of her home which had classified emails on it......... wrong Hillary is guilty of criminal negligence at the minimum..... Lock Her Up !!!!!!!!!!
23 | Greg Forby | 1540110816008943_1540215915998433 | Hey, NBC, not one "Fact Check" on Hillary, huh? Yeah, because, you know, she hasn't been a serial liar for decades. I'm sure everything she said in the debate was 100% truth. Lololol #YourBiasIsShowing
24 | Jimmy George | 1540110816008943_1540161549337203 | Are you guys serious right now? Wikileaks has released over 600,000 documents against Russia, but our intelligence can't take that into consideration? Wikileaks is trying to do something about the corruption in all countries, not just the United States. Try going to their website and actually researching the things they've done. Even though the documents are illegally recovered, does that discredit the fact that they're legitimate and incriminating against HRC and her campaign? No.
25 | Frederick Clay | 1540110816008943_1284268221618299 | I know this is pointless because Trump supporters don't reside in reality nor do they care to, but here we go with a reality check. First, Russia is not hacking Clintons email(so many people in here keep saying that) they are hacking her campaign manager, advisors and the Democratic Party emails. Second, the intelligence community are quoted to have said they believe Russia is behind this with confidence. Wiki leaks is not behind the hacks( people keep saying that too) they are the ones Russia is giving the documents to for release. 3rd yes this matters because for the first time a foreign leader, an adversary at that, is inferring with our election process and they are clearly trying to get one particular candidate elected.  Finally nothing that that has been released in these hacked emails is incriminating, embarrassing yes, they are sure to fuel more conspiracy theories but largely they simply show that Hillary Clinton is a politician.

FACT CHECK: Donald J. Trump says Hillary Clinton's plan would raise your taxes. This is only true if you are extremely rich.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Stacey Marie | 1540084186011606_1540107449342613 | Why are you only fact checking Trump? Oh yeaaaaa mainstream media is in Dems pockets
2 | Emerson Senden | 1540084186011606_1540107582675933 | Not a single thing he said tonight has been true. I'm honestly embarrassed that my country allowed this man to build his so called business in the first place. (AKA paying people to build his brand and allow him to take the credit.) what a deplorable. #ImWithHer
3 | Nicole Anzilotti | 1540084186011606_1540120496007975 | I have lost all respect for #NBC as you are so biased in reporting/sharing the news to the people...your coverage of Donald trump is old and played out and it reminds me of a young child throwing a fit screaming trying to get their way! I would actually respect your reporting on Donald Trump if you reported on all the horrific things Hillary has done as well, but you don't.
4 | Tina Henry | 1540084186011606_1540114779341880 | I will vote in anyway I can to prevent the most corrupt treasonous Hillary from becoming President! Whether you are a progressive or conservative or anything in between, you should do the same if you love this country! #NeverHillary
5 | Barbara Healey | 1540084186011606_1540107962675895 | Sorry, as someone who manages a budget worth millions of dollars, I know that's impossible. You can't give away a lot of free stuff including education, not cut anything from the budget, not raise taxes and be budget neutral.
6 | Ginger Alyson | 1540084186011606_1540117009341657 | Hmm. Her buddy Obama told me insurance would be more affordable and I could keep my doctor if I liked him. That was a lie. So is this! It is either a lie that middle class taxes aren't going to increase or it is a lie that she will be providing some other increased benefits such as free public tuition she is using to pander to millennial.
7 | Brett Peine | 1540084186011606_1540117616008263 | How will we give free college for most Americans without raising taxes.... how will we do most of what she wants without raising taxes.... oh wait, she's a life long politician. She doesn't understand a balanced budget. Only spend, spend, spend.
8 | Jan Johnson | 1540084186011606_1540134826006542 | I say we start a protest against NBC!  Why don't you fact check the fact that Hillary did not answer any of her questions about wikileaks!  Just like America wants talk about trump and his scandals we also want her to address the questions!!!
9 | Ipka Dachko Varuxa | 1540084186011606_1540112929342065 | If we make more than $125k we have to pay for college, but if you make less, you don't have to pay? Is that fair? Did you mention that this is Hillary's plan??
10 | Billi Ingram | 1540084186011606_1540121016007923 | So explain this to me: how can college education be "free" (tax-funded) for any family making less than $125k/year (which includes many people who can afford to pay for it) by only raising taxes on the people making $250k/year or greater? Are you telling me that they are going to get enough tax revenue from the 1% to pay for the majority to go to college? That is an outright lie! It doesn't make sense financially. The only way it would make sense would be to bankrupt the wealthy with tax liability in order to pay for the majority of the population's college tuition. Not going to happen. She is a liar! Think about it! She will either raise taxes on the middle class or nobody will get free college. There's no other way to pay for it. Period.
11 | Chris N Katie Gearhart | 1540084186011606_1540127332673958 | So he wasn't wrong is what I'm reading. She is raising taxes and you're trying to make it look as tho he is still somehow wrong. Do you even need a high school education to be a journalist?
12 | Jon Cato | 1540084186011606_1540188182667873 | Your fact checking is bogus. Hillary Clinton straight up said she would raise taxes on middle class workers. Last time I checked middle class is not extremely rich. NBC News its time for you to stop with your blatant lies and biased to fit your agenda to make a push for Hillary. Your reporting is no different than Hillary herself standing up before the people with bald face lies
13 | Toby Swofford | 1540084186011606_1540125332674158 | Fact check. Clinton destroyed mutiple mobile devices that were subpoenad during an investigation. Clinton deleted emails after they had been subpoenad. Clinton was not charged after her husband met with AG Lynch.
14 | April Anderson | 1540084186011606_1540123766007648 | Your fact checking is actually wrong. She said TONIGHT she would start in the middle for "fixing" the tax problem. You need you get your "facts" straight before posting such bias stuff.
15 | Barbara Jackson Cassiliano | 1540084186011606_1540130646006960 | NBC hired Chelsea Clinton fresh out of college and her starting pay was 600,000. Thousand dollars. Thanks to her mother. What a joke.
16 | Terry Harden | 1540084186011606_1540140186006006 | Exactly why I do not watch NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC!  All are in the tank for democratic candidate regardless of who it is.  Been that way for decades!
17 | Jackie Page | 1540084186011606_1540169702669721 | NBC - Clinton Cheerleaders You are such incredible hypocrites totally ignoring all the illegal & morally corrupt actions of the Clinton's.
18 | Jennifer Johns | 1540084186011606_1540194732667218 | Why is NBC only fact checking Trump? Bias news---- shame on you! You are supposed to be balanced. Don't tell me Hillary didn't lie!!
19 | Oltiana Mehl | 1540084186011606_1540186002668091 | Here goes NBC campaigning for Hillary again. Hillary, says she would raise taxes on the rich. Trump responds: "You can't control those who sponsor you Hillary." Conclusion? More lies coming from Hillary. Is there anyone her that thinks the rich would sponsor Hillary, but then sit back and watch her take their wealth away? No idiot ever became rich, so obviously they won't let Hillary outsmart them. Hillary is just saying this hoping that there are enough idiots out there to believe her.
20 | Randi BornAgain Lewis | 1540084186011606_1540128152673876 | I think Mr Trump might be actually right with one thing,a biased media,where are the Clinton fact checks? It seems all the bad about hillary gets suppressed and the good greatly highlighted. And all the bad about trump gets highlighted and the good suppressed.Come on NBC,I can't vote as yet,but when I can,I want to know that I'll have fairness in every aspect to may my decisions from
21 | Cheyenne Ridgeway | 1540084186011606_1540121696007855 | This man is an embarrassment. Look: a tantrumming, name-calling child on the world stage. We should hang our heads in shame that this man is running for president. He is a national disgrace!
22 | Michael Del Castillo | 1540084186011606_1540178239335534 | How much did you receive from the "Clinton Foundation" NBC? This isn't journalism. This is biased media at its finest.
23 | Maureen Matt | 1540084186011606_1540215495998475 | Notice how Trump avoided talking about how he would address Social Security & Medicare funding and Wallace didn't follow up on it, because Trump and the GOP want to privatize social security and medicare and cut medicaid. All so the super wealthy can pay less in taxes!!
24 | Juan Deleon | 1540084186011606_1212320898825168 | Trump people keep blaming the media about trump's own mistakes, thing is the same biased media also reported on Hillary Clinton emails, wikileaks, illegal  contributions, and paid speeches to big comporations. Get real this is a fair battle is just trump not being smart enough to fight it
25 | Sarah Gilmore | 1540084186011606_1540123712674320 | Why do y'all even act like Americans have a choice? Like our voices matter. Doesn't matter who wins really, even though it's gonna be Hillary.. America's gonna end up wiped off the map either way.
