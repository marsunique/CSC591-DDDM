Tourism has taken over as the primary industry in Cape Breton. What happened? Donald J. Trump
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Matt Smith | 39 | 10155574665361509_10155574705141509 | Being Canadian, I don't care so much about Trumps policies as much as I just like the sound of 4 years of Liberal tears if he wins.
2 | Michelle AuCoin | 2 | 10155574665361509_10155574729196509 | Actually, tourism has always been the major industry in Cape Breton and it is not the RESULT of the "Trump Bump" that you are referring to. I recognize that CNN was here reporting information on our island, but let me be clear....we have been on the international scale as one of the most beautiful islands in the world, long before your political disaster. Perhaps more investigative journalism - something CNN seems to be lacking during the entirety of this election - would have provided you with this information. As a Canadian, with several American friends whom I adore, I respectfully (as Canadians are respectful) hope for great things for the US post-election. But please do not taint the reputation of our island and it's naturall beauty with your politics.
3 | Steve Hamilton | 3 | 10155574665361509_10155574720061509 | And I thought the Canadian election was bad. Both of these candidates are complete idiots. What an embarrassment for the U.S......Glad I live in Canada

2 | John McAuliffe | 437 | 10155574607641509_10155574612241509 | I have completely lost my appetite for celebs who have come out  in support for Hillary. That's their loss. Their earnings are made from entertainment, And Politics does not mix with entertainment.
3 | James Gee | 223 | 10155574607641509_10155574615466509 | OH NO ..... HOW WILL AMERICA SURVIVE IF THEY LEAVE!!!!Gtfo losers.You'll be back when you see how much more expensive it is to live somewhere else. (Mexico not included)

5 | Jacob Smith | 92 | 10155574607641509_10155574618526509 | Most of them are irrelevant, and not likely they will move.Where will they record their albums or film their shows?Most people don't care what a bunch of disconnected wealthy elite entertainers think anyway.

8 | Clifford Phillips Jr | 48 | 10155574607641509_10155574613081509 | Just a reminder about Donald J. Trump. This is a man who‚Äôs: -Mocked a man with disabilities. -Attacked the parents of a fallen American hero. -Belittled POWs and the war record of Sen. John McCain. -Lied about how much money he raised for veterans. -Called a former Miss Universe ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù and fat, telling his Twitter followers to find her non-existent sex tape. -Accused an American-born federal judge of being unfit to do his job because of his Mexican heritage. -Likely avoided paying taxes for nearly two decades. -Called most Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, even though that‚Äôs not remotely factual. -Lied about seeing ‚Äúthousands and thousands‚Äù of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. -Lied about getting a letter from the NFL complaining about the debate schedule. -Tried to exploit the death of an African American woman in Chicago to say that‚Äôs why black voters will support him.-Found the ‚Äúbright side‚Äù to tragedies because his poll numbers tend to go up.-Settled with the Department of Justice after his company was found guilty of racially discriminating against minorities. -Has cheated on at least one wife. -Was just discovered on video admitting that he not only tried to cheat on his current wife, but he attempted to do so with another married woman. -Had his first wife publicly say that he did nothing when it came to raising their children until they were old enough to talk business. -Tweeted that women should have expected to be sexually assaulted when they mixed males and females together in the military. -Said he wants to target the families of terrorists. -Stated that he wants to ban an entire religion. -Praised a Russian president who obviously hates the U.S. and Americans. -Encouraged the Russian government to commit espionage against Americans. -Insinuated that another Republican‚Äôs wife was ugly. -Tried to implicate another Republican‚Äôs father in JFK‚Äôs assassination. -Sought out the help of former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes after he was fired following multiple allegations that he had sexually harassed women for years. -Made Breitbart‚Äôs Steve Bannon one of his top campaign people. -Had a former campaign manager abruptly resign after a report came out linking him to pro-Russian groups that were directly trying to undermine U.S. policy in eastern Europe. -Called Carly Fiornia ugly. -Has said climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese ‚Äî then denied saying it. -Was a leading conspiracy theorist when it came to the racist-driven birther conspiracies against President Barack Obama. -Dismissed nearly eight years of accusing the president of not being an American with a less than 30 second statement where he didn‚Äôt apologize for any of it. -Tried to blame Hillary Clinton for his racism. Re-tweeted anti-African American propaganda created by a white supremacy group. -Played dumb about knowing who former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke was. -Skipped a presidential debate because he was scared of a moderator. -Has, on several occasions, suggested he finds his daughter attractive. -Called a husband doing things like changing diapers and helping with the children, a man ‚Äútrying to be the wife.‚Äù -Has said he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. -Said he can‚Äôt release his tax returns because they‚Äôre currently being audited ‚Äî even though the IRS said that‚Äôs a lie. -Feels he has the right to sexually assault women.These are the classic signs of a sociopath. -Doesn‚Äôt believe the rules or laws apply to him. -Seems to have no concern about the consequences of his actions.-Is impulsive. -Shows frequent signs of being reckless. -Is unpredictable. -Lacks morals. -Is a narcissist. -Has proven to be hot-tempered and a bit of a loose cannon. -Lacks empathy or sympathy for others. -Is manipulative to get what he wants. -Almost never apologizes.-Often invents outrageous lies about his success or experiences. -Seems to believe that what he says is the truth, even if it isn‚Äôt.This describes Trump to a tee. Explain to me why he's the president we need.
9 | Will Cosens | 30 | 10155574607641509_10155574629196509 | If they dislike Trump that much that they would dessert their own country over it then that just makes their opinions invalid, why would you up and leave just because you dislike a president of the USA?? plenty of Trump voters feel that Obama was the worst president in their history but have stayed and are now voting for Trump to avoid a repeat of Obama with a Clinton presidency, use your vote people running away is just cowardly and a classic example of the Hollywood elites doing everything in their power to stop Trump winning but it won't work, get out and vote America!!! Trump2016!!!
10 | Harry Kracken | 27 | 10155574607641509_10155574627751509 | Bunch of cry babies.  They all sound like a bunch of whiny grade school children throwing a temper tantrum.  "If I don't get my way, I am going to cross my arms and stomp my feet and march away.  Whaaawhaaaa."
11 | Anthony Anderson | 9 | 10155574607641509_10155574614311509 | So it's ok for people to leave America when they're dissatisfied with the President, but bombs are falling on Syria and they should stay put... hm
12 | Tina Kumley Barnes | 14 | 10155574607641509_10155574616166509 | If you know someone who is gay, Vote Trump. If you know someone who is Christian, vote Trump. Hillary wants to keep bringing in the unvetted refugees. She does not care about the safety of our borders. And she has the unfinished business of taking down Syria so she can get her oil line through Syria. She does not care what that means to the children, women and families there. She is also a Jeffrey Dahmer type who sacrifices children in Satanic cult practices and she has sex with minor children preferring 12 year old girls This information comes from Wikileaks, Huma's email, and from the LIfe Insurance File of 650,000 emails found on Anthony Weiners laptop put there by Huma Abdelin.
13 | MiKe Pui | 3 | 10155574607641509_685584991615173 | I don't usually butt in other foreign affairs but for a leader sitting in the oval office that could control a lot of things with high power, it would be the whole world asking for a wise leader. Unfortunately with Trump's characteristics and behavior, I would say he would invite more foes than friends. IMHO.
14 | Esther Clark | 2 | 10155574607641509_10155574657741509 | Then move Donald Trump becomes president I'm a Democrat I voted for Hillary. However I'm not going to let Donald Trump run me out of my country. That my mom came from the disaster after World War II to this country. I'm going to stay here and fight I'm going to vote in every election and make sure I clean out that house period running away from things don't get you nowhere in life you gotta stay back and fight for what you believe in. So go ahead and pack your bags and leave but I'm going to stay in this country and I'm going to make it better if Donald Trump wins I will fight to make sure he doesn't ruin this country by going in voting and making sure I left the right people
15 | Joseph Eleke | 1 | 10155574607641509_878762485594393 | Americans, if you are reading this either inside polling boot and you are about to vote, please vote for Donald trump. If you want saver America, go ahead and do this cos voting this woman is like calling for more anarchy. Remember the illegal migrant issue and how jihadist are gradually strolling into your country. Remember your "moto" which says "IN GOD WE TRUST" Remember that outside world is looking at you for socour, peace and progress of human race. Make America great again and create more jobs for yourselves because stagnancy wont help you. Don't allow others to take what rightfully belong to you. #VoteTrumpMassivelyToFreeYourselvesAndIncomingGenerations. #GreatGeorgBushDidIt.....and Donald Trump will even do better. #truthheals and must be spoken no matter whose ox is gored.
16 | Zane Ecklund | 0 | 10155574607641509_10155574671766509 | I really hate this. This isn't a statement its an insult. I don't want Trump to win but guess what I don't have the means to leave if he does. Ironically boasting about this is Trumpian in a way because it reeks of elitism
17 | Katie Byrne Budd | 0 | 10155574607641509_685588491614823 | Must be nice to have millions to actually be able to do that... here's an idea.. with all of your money, do something good for the country, rather than whine about moving to another country if Trump wins.  Get over yourselves.
18 | Travis Robertson | 0 | 10155574607641509_878763005594341 | So a bunch of celebs who are only mildly effected if ever at all by the policy changes to America, know whats best? "Oh we must do something about global warming!! Fly commercial? Oh hell no will not fly with the common folk. I prefer to place more carbon in the atmosphere in one trip than many do in a year!!!! Why cause I am famous!!!!
19 | John Schmidt | 6 | 10155574607641509_10155574642581509 | Lmfao. I like how all the celebrities said they would move to Canada why isn't anybody moving to Mexico to show your support?
20 | Kristi Montgomery Byrd | 1 | 10155574607641509_10155574670301509 | I can't wait till they leave!  Who cares if they do. They think their opinion is going to sway others. Everyone be smart, do what you think is right, and don't base your opinions off of the corrupt media (CNN) or from overprivileged celebrities who think just because they are famous they hold sway over our votes. Let's take back our government from these corrupt criminals who only care about themselves!  Let's make America great again!  Let's drain the swamp!   Vote Trump!!!!!
21 | Burns Kelli | 1 | 10155574607641509_685583474948658 | ‚ö†If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ ‚ö†If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment? ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ
22 | Holly Bailey | 0 | 10155574607641509_10155574662881509 | Not exactly intentional voter fraud but local polling location attendant stupidity. I went to vote and the gentleman in front of me (behind the curtain) selected a write-in but apparently hit the wrong button so he called for the attendant who did not know how to correct the situation so she called over to the other attendants and the man (in his best Nancy Pelosi voice) said push the button and "see what happens." Really? That's the level of competence at the polling location here. Well what happened was it registered part of his voting selections but they had no idea to to correct it and couldn't figure out whether to let him vote again or allow his partial selections. Not one attendant there knew how to handle the situation which was unfortunately not a surprise. Run Forrest Run!
23 | Mike Simon | 3 | 10155574607641509_10155574631216509 | At the end of the day neither Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump are winners! The only winner in this election will be the media... With all their hate & discontent they've manged to stir both candidates up to the point all they can do is criticize each other with words like corrupt, racist, sexist etc. The media has managed to do it to Americans as well!
24 | Melissa Porter | 0 | 10155574607641509_685585694948436 | I'm really so sick of seeing posts about who has pledged to leave the country if so-and-so wins. Anyone who says that doesn't deserve to be in America and good riddance. We need true Americans with pride in their communities and nation to stay and continue to be an example of the change they want to see in this country. We need people willing to stick around and stand up for their beliefs. We need more people to be involved and to care about this country. Just because your candidate didn't win doesn't mean all is lost. It should actually fire you up to fight harder for the country you want to see. But if you have this mentality then shame on you. How incredibly egotistical and entitled of a celebrity to turn their back on their country based on an election outcome, when this country and the people in it have blessed their lives so much. Grow up, or don't let the door hit you on the way out.
25 | Timothy Kornegay | 1 | 10155574607641509_10155574662121509 | Bye bye! Democrats better pack their bags if Hillary wins. Gloves are going to come off. People are pissed. I watched a car at Walmart yesterday with a I'm With Her Bumper Sticker get basically ruined by a group of young Trump supporters! It was awesome! If you are dumb enough to vote democrat then you deserve what happens to you.

1 | Matt Sobek | 89 | 10155574532211509_10155574551186509 | This is quite possibly the most unnecessary use of a drone that I've seen. Not to mention you are flying over a parking lot with cars and people below.
2 | Stanley Berhorst | 41 | 10155574532211509_2113110518914895 | You are not in a drone, you have a drone flying above a voting center. Don't they teach english in school any more? #commoncorejournalism

1 | Kurdi Kurdi | 441 | 10155574511756509_10155574517691509 | I'm a Democrat and i'm voting for Trump, for the fact that all this criminals has come out against Trump is another reason to vote for Trump in act of defiance against the establishment, the elites, Dynasty, corrupt Politicians, Bias media, communist celebrities and lying Comedians.
2 | David H Craig | 294 | 10155574511756509_10155574519151509 | Hillary has no credibility, Regardless of what Hillary Clinton says she is still under investigation by the FBI, one by the Public Corruption Group the other by the National Security Group. The Email is the only Scandal is closed for now.
3 | Jodie Featherston Moss | 142 | 10155574511756509_10155574519811509 | I don't like either candidate. However, presentation is important. The president is a representative, if you will, of our country. People from all over the world, our allies & enemies, judge us in large part, by the demeanor of our leader as he/she speaks. Trump has no filter. He cannot handle criticism. He cannot handle opposing views. He cannot handle a tough situation. He throws a fit like a belligerent, childish man, even during speeches. He makes the most obscure, immature, irresponsible remarks. All for the world to see. Hillary, is able to maintain her composure, at least act professional & has a filter when on camera. These qualities are very important when the world is watching.I had originally planned to vote third party. Now I've decided this election, isn't the election to do that. I'll be giving Hillary my vote to help keep sociopathic Trump, out.
4 | Corey Golden | 111 | 10155574511756509_10155574530661509 | Ms. Clinton will do the best she can at looking out for her interests and her big donors. Enough is enough America, wake up!
5 | Md.Arifur Rahman | 72 | 10155574511756509_10155574537946509 | Donald Trump, the King of Bankruptcy, professional conman, draft dodger, tax cheat and sexual predator is a psychotic self-absorbed narcissist. Burn in hell.....
6 | Derik Sherman | 61 | 10155574511756509_10155574538326509 | I voted, without any second thought, for Mrs. Clinton not because she would be the first woman president, that would be a perk, but not a reason. It's because she has a vision of bringing people tgether, she has a calm and collected demeanor that is best fit for tense situations like these.
7 | Clifford Phillips Jr | 56 | 10155574511756509_10155574531106509 | Just a reminder about Donald J. Trump. This is a man who‚Äôs: -Mocked a man with disabilities. -Attacked the parents of a fallen American hero. -Belittled POWs and the war record of Sen. John McCain. -Lied about how much money he raised for veterans. -Called a former Miss Universe ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù and fat, telling his Twitter followers to find her non-existent sex tape. -Accused an American-born federal judge of being unfit to do his job because of his Mexican heritage. -Likely avoided paying taxes for nearly two decades. -Called most Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, even though that‚Äôs not remotely factual. -Lied about seeing ‚Äúthousands and thousands‚Äù of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. -Lied about getting a letter from the NFL complaining about the debate schedule. -Tried to exploit the death of an African American woman in Chicago to say that‚Äôs why black voters will support him.-Found the ‚Äúbright side‚Äù to tragedies because his poll numbers tend to go up.-Settled with the Department of Justice after his company was found guilty of racially discriminating against minorities. -Has cheated on at least one wife. -Was just discovered on video admitting that he not only tried to cheat on his current wife, but he attempted to do so with another married woman. -Had his first wife publicly say that he did nothing when it came to raising their children until they were old enough to talk business. -Tweeted that women should have expected to be sexually assaulted when they mixed males and females together in the military. -Said he wants to target the families of terrorists. -Stated that he wants to ban an entire religion. -Praised a Russian president who obviously hates the U.S. and Americans. -Encouraged the Russian government to commit espionage against Americans. -Insinuated that another Republican‚Äôs wife was ugly. -Tried to implicate another Republican‚Äôs father in JFK‚Äôs assassination. -Sought out the help of former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes after he was fired following multiple allegations that he had sexually harassed women for years. -Made Breitbart‚Äôs Steve Bannon one of his top campaign people. -Had a former campaign manager abruptly resign after a report came out linking him to pro-Russian groups that were directly trying to undermine U.S. policy in eastern Europe. -Called Carly Fiornia ugly. -Has said climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese ‚Äî then denied saying it. -Was a leading conspiracy theorist when it came to the racist-driven birther conspiracies against President Barack Obama. -Dismissed nearly eight years of accusing the president of not being an American with a less than 30 second statement where he didn‚Äôt apologize for any of it. -Tried to blame Hillary Clinton for his racism. Re-tweeted anti-African American propaganda created by a white supremacy group. -Played dumb about knowing who former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke was. -Skipped a presidential debate because he was scared of a moderator. -Has, on several occasions, suggested he finds his daughter attractive. -Called a husband doing things like changing diapers and helping with the children, a man ‚Äútrying to be the wife.‚Äù -Has said he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. -Said he can‚Äôt release his tax returns because they‚Äôre currently being audited ‚Äî even though the IRS said that‚Äôs a lie. -Feels he has the right to sexually assault women.These are the classic signs of a sociopath. -Doesn‚Äôt believe the rules or laws apply to him. -Seems to have no concern about the consequences of his actions.-Is impulsive. -Shows frequent signs of being reckless. -Is unpredictable. -Lacks morals. -Is a narcissist. -Has proven to be hot-tempered and a bit of a loose cannon. -Lacks empathy or sympathy for others. -Is manipulative to get what he wants. -Almost never apologizes.-Often invents outrageous lies about his success or experiences. -Seems to believe that what he says is the truth, even if it isn‚Äôt.This describes Trump to a tee. Explain to me why he's the president we need.

10 | Esther Clark | 9 | 10155574511756509_10155574564131509 | When she was speaking I was looking at bill. I know he's not a perfect man but he's not the only man that has cheated on his wife. I do believe he made a mistake. When I'm sitting here watching him you can just see the love that he has for Hillary he kind of looked like he was tearing up. He is watched her grow since they've gotten married he wouldn't have been in the white house if she wouldn't have pushed him like he said she's always put him first and it's nice to see that he's standing by her and putting her first now.
11 | Charlene McGroom Lester | 12 | 10155574511756509_10155574549301509 | Ain't it funny how CNN always covers her and taking up for her and making her look like a good person knowing that she's not I think this whole thing is all about money I wonder how much she donates to them well it won't be her money she donated to them . For some reason in my heart I feel this hole thing is rigged by the clintons she will probably win because she's paid everybody off and that's a fact

16 | Alisha Gamboa | 5 | 10155574511756509_10155574584106509 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.

Uneducated people cannot see that Trump is dangerous to our country. The educated people around Columbus, OH and more economically sound areas (not many in Ohio) are #withher .
24 | Kristina Wilson | 2 | 10155574511756509_1411471788880818 | ‚ö†If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ

Why is it so hard to vote in the United States? http://cnn.it/2fzAK1x
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dexter Sam | 144 | 10155574315221509_10155574385571509 | I think the first Woman president of the united states should be the greatest ever.. not some one who is under FBI investigation and a ton of scandals.. not really a great example for Girls.. think about it...
2 | Steve Walton | 182 | 10155574315221509_10155574347146509 | Can anyone tell me what does Beyonc√©, Jay z , Bruce Springsteen  ,  Bon Jovi's Songs have anything to do with any of the country's problems or world issues and HILLARY CLINTON's POLICY??!! Why are they there?? She paid them!!!! ??!! ..... if anyone voted for this HILLARY Clinton's gimmick is a super fool
3 | Michael Pack | 72 | 10155574315221509_10155574396656509 | Only hard for idiots like CNN, everyone else the system is working fine and very easy, bring your photo ID and stand peacefully in line to do your civic duty as an American.
4 | Alisha Gamboa | 24 | 10155574315221509_10155574404551509 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.
5 | Tim Ingram | 22 | 10155574315221509_10155574427926509 | Um its not hard to vote in the US.1. Must be 182. Must be registered to vote unless your state does not require 3. Go to polls and voteSeems pretty simple to me. Besides our veterans, alive and dead  made it an easy task. I really dont understand your point Cnn

Most Floridians have upwards of 20ish different items to vote on. In our city we have 36 items! How annoying.. Sorry these people in those states have 8 decisions to make!

9 | Joe Strickland | 6 | 10155574315221509_10155574398191509 | After this election, Im probably done voting... The collectivist notion of using votes to bully ones neighbors and at large fellow Americans into submitting to their view of government is by its nature immoral.
10 | John Plunk | 7 | 10155574315221509_10155574436831509 | You fill out a voter registration form once in your life, you vote a minimum of once every four years and never have to register again. You either vote early or vote absentee if you can't be at your polling place on election day. You get in line with photo id in hand and vote. That's pretty simple. The only problem you encounter are idiots who stand in front of the voting machine staring at it like they are looking at a NASA pre-flight checklist.
11 | Matthew Butterworth | 3 | 10155574315221509_10155574420211509 | I mean come on! Go to the county clerk's office or wherever ahead of time, fill out the form and do what you need to do. It's only burdensome if you're lazy and love to make excuses.

15 | Jennifer A. Jones | 0 | 10155574315221509_10155574489451509 | Oh bull you all make it sound SOOO difficult. Haha you sign a piece of paper. Okayyy and don't act like voting is the only thing that required ID. Employers let you off to vote and they are open before and after work. It isn't as difficult as you make it seem.
16 | Sha Lee Schilthuis | 1 | 10155574315221509_10155574663016509 | Voting is hard when you have to take the day off work to wait in line for hours and hours.Voting is hard when you have to find a sitter because there is no way your sick toddler is waiting in that 9 hour line with you.Voting is hard when there is only one understaffed polling place in your town.Voting is hard when half the polling equipment is broken or malfunction so you dont even know if your vote will be counted.Voting is hard when when you have all the proper identification, yet the technology glitches and cant find you.Voting is hard when you are elderly / disabled / injured and standing in line is painful or impossible.Voting is hard when mail in / early voting is not allowed / restricted in your state.Registering to vote is easy. Voting is hard.
17 | Diane Martin O'Connor | 1 | 10155574315221509_10155574447396509 | In this day and age it is unacceptable to see the kind of issues we have with voting. The simple way to solve this problem is when you register to vote you get a voter ID card with your picture, similar to a drivers license. Show this ID and go vote. They also need to add more voting sites and encourage more mail in voting. This could help reduce the stress and issues with voting.
18 | David Barber | 0 | 10155574315221509_10155574673511509 | It's not hard at all to vote in the USA... All it takes is a minimal amount of effort. If you can't take 15 to 20 minutes out of your day once every year to vote, then it's you that has a problem, not the system in place. Let's stop playing the "victim card" CNN.
19 | Keysha Parker | 2 | 10155574315221509_10155574441576509 | Should be treated like a National holiday.....everyone should be off with the exception of medical personnel and law enforcement....they should be given a day off during early voting or an absentee ballot... Republicans make it hard for a reason....
20 | Joe Porter | 1 | 10155574315221509_10155574638281509 | Why CNN is not obliterating Donna Brazile for humiliating them again yesterday on XM radio for saying she'd pass debate questions to Hillary again if she had the chance is why I believe CNN was complicit. Brazile has the goods on them. So disappointed with CNN this past year.
21 | Kory Cassell | 0 | 10155574315221509_10155574453376509 | is it? we just fill out the ballot at home and mail it in, in Oregon. or, drop it off at ballot drop.  The only problem I had was with a liberal that went through the ballot drop drive thru lane the wrong way. Because dropping your ballot off thru your passenger window is easier than the drivers side right?! duh
22 | David H Craig | 0 | 10155574315221509_10155574532671509 | Hillary has no credibility, Regardless of what Hillary Clinton says she is still under investigation by the FBI, one by the Public Corruption Group the other by the National Security Group. The Email is the only Scandal is closed for now.
23 | Burns Kelli | 0 | 10155574315221509_10155574680806509 | ‚ö†If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ ‚ö†If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment? ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ
24 | Michael H Henshaw | 1 | 10155574315221509_10155574528391509 | It's pretty easy actually. Register to vote at the DMV or sometimes your local notary office, have an updated driver's license or other acceptable ID, go to your polling facility, and check the boxes you want to vote for.It's not complicated, any adult can handle it, heck my 14 year old brother could probably handle it. To say that voter ID suppresses minorities is offensive, and borderline racist. That implies that minorities are not as capable as other people. Doesn't sound so nice when you put it that way.
25 | Tony Burd | 0 | 10155574315221509_10155574565781509 | I really don't understand this article. In Ohio, I filled out the paperwork online in July. I printed it off, signed it, and put it in the mail. August I received a letter that said I was registered to vote. Was that really that hard? If you can't do that other states than they need to catch up.

3 | Alisha Gamboa | 17 | 10155573443781509_10155574405751509 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.

8 | Sam Nutting | 0 | 10155573443781509_10155574735136509 | From Bill Morris, former political advisor to BILL CLINTON!!  Please share, copy & paste. BILL CLINTON'S LOVING WIFE --- by DICK MORRISIf you happen to see the Bill Clinton five minute TV ad for Hillary in which he introduces the commercial by saying he wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary's background, beware as I was there for most of their presidency and know them better than just about anyone. I offer a few corrections:Bill says: "In law school Hillary worked on legal services for the poor."Facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in 'Law School' was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a 'Federal Agent.' She went to Court every day as part of a Law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.Bill says: "Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a Children's rights project for poor kids."Facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.Bill says: "Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers."Facts are: She flunked the D.C. bar exam, 'Yes', flunked it, it is a matter of record, and only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas, 'None', and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She did not join the prestigious Rose Law Firm until Bill became Arkansas Attorney General and was made a partner only after he was elected Arkansas Governor.Bill says: "President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its Chairman."Facts are: The appointment was in exchange for Bill's support for Carter in his 1980 primary against Ted Kennedy. Hillary then became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter's choice to be chairman.Bill says: "She served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital."Facts are: Yes she did. But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the Wal-Mart Board of Directors, for a substantial fee. She was silent about their labor and health care practices.Bill says: "Hillary didn't succeed at getting health care for all Americans in 1994 but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance."Facts are: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. I know; I helped to negotiate the deal. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals' tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.Bill says: "Hillary was the face of America all over the World." (LOL)Facts are: Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House. Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them.Bill says: "Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for Children's and Women's issues."Facts are: Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation. One set up a national park in Puerto Rico. A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid 911 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire N.Y. delegation. Presently she is trying to have the US memorialize Woodstock.Here is what bothers me more than anything else about Hillary Clinton. She has done everything possible to weaken the President and our Country (that's you and me) when it comes to the 'War on Terror'.1. She wants to close GITMO and move the combatants to the USA where they would have access to our legal system.2. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of suspected Al Qaeda phone calls to/from the USA.3. She wants to grant constitutional rights to enemy combatants captured on the battlefield.4. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of money transfers between suspected Al Qaeda cells and supporters in the USA.5. She wants to eliminate the type of interrogation tactics used by the Military & CIA where coercion might be used when questioning known terrorists even though such tactics might save American lives.One cannot think of a single 'Bill', Hillary has introduced or a single comment she has made that would tend to strengthen our Country in the 'War on Terror'. But, one can think of a lot of comments she has made that weaken our Country and makes it a more dangerous situation for all of us. Bottom line: She goes hand in hand with the ACLU on far too many issues where common sense is abandoned.Share this with everyone you know, ask them to prove Dick Morris wrong. Think about it - he's (Dick Morris) said all of this openly, thus if he were not truthful he'd be liable for 'Defamation of Character' !And you better believe Hillary would sue him.Her winning in 2016 means the final death knell for America! Her whole public life has been a LIE.By Dick Morris, former political advisor to President Bill ClintonTHERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE UNAWARE OF THESE FACTS
9 | Huibin Liang | 8 | 10155573443781509_10155573894446509 | Go out to vote whoever candidates care about the future of the mother earth. That being said, I meant not the brainless Trump who does not believe global warming and along with the people who endorse him.
10 | Han Yin | 1 | 10155573443781509_10155574398281509 | Interesting that this time nobody stands out and say "Nah, poor quality! I knew it was made in Chi... Wait, is it Japan? Oh this must be some coincidence."
11 | Tammie Lillard | 3 | 10155573443781509_10155574300171509 | With as many Christians, Jews and Muslims in America how is this race even close? Each of our faiths is against abortion. Christian faith says God knew us before we were born and thou shall not kill, Muslim faith states a fetus is a living soul at 4 months and Jewish faith states abortion is forbidden with exception given according to Jewish scholar Rashi In regard to life-risking pregnancies, How is it so many woman are voting for a person that will uphold the practice of late term abortion? I would rather stand with God and be judged by the world than stand with this world and be judged by God.
12 | Kenny Kieso | 18 | 10155573443781509_10155573503116509 | Win or lose today I stand with Trump. There are many people who chose not to learn who the real Donald Trump is. Well I have. The media has torn him apart everyday while editing his rally's speeches for the purpose of a agenda. Trump stands for something more then just a candidate running for president. He couldn't be bought or controlled and that strikes fear throughout our corrupt government to even those such as the owners of most media networks. Politicians We the People thought could be trusted such as the Bushes and Bernie Sanders all bought into our corrupt government. The GOP & DNC establishment are also interconnected in this same corruptive connection. We all have been devastated with this election yet in the end one thing is clear. We CAN NOT let this corrupt money hungry government continue using our country as a get rich quick network. It's draining our economy while taking our jobs and selling them off to the highest pay for play government. Decisions are being made in the name of speaking fees and donations to corrupt politicians instead of what's best for our America. When Trump talks about a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants for the sake of our security until we as a nation can properly vet and background check to stop terrorist from entering our country he is called a racist and bigot. He talks about crimes happening in our country from illegals who shouldn't have been in our country anyway so he is considered a racist. Trump who goes on and on about finally putting Americans first while allowing only the America loving "dreamers" use the legal system of citizenship to gain our benefits such as voting. This is the man the media talks about hate when if people would just listen to him he is all about love. Love for our beautiful country, love for our people, and all people no matter your color, nationality or religion. He wants us to be safe and prosper with great jobs and a good economy. He wants us to have a government ran by the people and for the people not by a corrupt establishment. This is important, far more important then any election in the past. The next president will be able to appoint up to 5 Supreme Court justices. This economy can't take any more debt. I remember when we hit 1 trillion in national debt and people thought it was the end of the world. Now we are closing in on nearly 20 trillion and if you think more of the same is going to help I'm sorry but your wrong. Donald Trump said he doesn't want to be paid as a president. He said he only wants to give back to his country. In interviews as far back as 1980 he as been worried about the state of our country with the building of corruption within our government. Every time he was asked if he wanted to run for president he said he would rather not. Unfortunately nothing was getting better, he couldn't watch crooked politicians and large companies destroy this country for their own gain anymore. He did something about it and tomorrow we need to do our part. As for how I feel about Donald Trump, win or lose he is a American Hero. He is running for the American people not money, power or to repay international and domestic donors and special interest. One Last time I will ask for people to research him. Share this with your friends and please vote!

Donald Trump Jr. talks about what happens if his father wins the presidency http://cnn.it/2fztCST
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Clifford Phillips Jr | 507 | 10155573215316509_10155573225036509 | Just a reminder about Donald J. Trump. This is a man who‚Äôs: -Mocked a man with disabilities. -Attacked the parents of a fallen American hero. -Belittled POWs and the war record of Sen. John McCain. -Lied about how much money he raised for veterans. -Called a former Miss Universe ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù and fat, telling his Twitter followers to find her non-existent sex tape. -Accused an American-born federal judge of being unfit to do his job because of his Mexican heritage. -Likely avoided paying taxes for nearly two decades. -Called most Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, even though that‚Äôs not remotely factual. -Lied about seeing ‚Äúthousands and thousands‚Äù of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. -Lied about getting a letter from the NFL complaining about the debate schedule. -Tried to exploit the death of an African American woman in Chicago to say that‚Äôs why black voters will support him.-Found the ‚Äúbright side‚Äù to tragedies because his poll numbers tend to go up.-Settled with the Department of Justice after his company was found guilty of racially discriminating against minorities. -Has cheated on at least one wife. -Was just discovered on video admitting that he not only tried to cheat on his current wife, but he attempted to do so with another married woman. -Had his first wife publicly say that he did nothing when it came to raising their children until they were old enough to talk business. -Tweeted that women should have expected to be sexually assaulted when they mixed males and females together in the military. -Said he wants to target the families of terrorists. -Stated that he wants to ban an entire religion. -Praised a Russian president who obviously hates the U.S. and Americans. -Encouraged the Russian government to commit espionage against Americans. -Insinuated that another Republican‚Äôs wife was ugly. -Tried to implicate another Republican‚Äôs father in JFK‚Äôs assassination. -Sought out the help of former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes after he was fired following multiple allegations that he had sexually harassed women for years. -Made Breitbart‚Äôs Steve Bannon one of his top campaign people. -Had a former campaign manager abruptly resign after a report came out linking him to pro-Russian groups that were directly trying to undermine U.S. policy in eastern Europe. -Called Carly Fiornia ugly. -Has said climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese ‚Äî then denied saying it. -Was a leading conspiracy theorist when it came to the racist-driven birther conspiracies against President Barack Obama. -Dismissed nearly eight years of accusing the president of not being an American with a less than 30 second statement where he didn‚Äôt apologize for any of it. -Tried to blame Hillary Clinton for his racism. Re-tweeted anti-African American propaganda created by a white supremacy group. -Played dumb about knowing who former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke was. -Skipped a presidential debate because he was scared of a moderator. -Has, on several occasions, suggested he finds his daughter attractive. -Called a husband doing things like changing diapers and helping with the children, a man ‚Äútrying to be the wife.‚Äù -Has said he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. -Said he can‚Äôt release his tax returns because they‚Äôre currently being audited ‚Äî even though the IRS said that‚Äôs a lie. -Feels he has the right to sexually assault women.These are the classic signs of a sociopath. -Doesn‚Äôt believe the rules or laws apply to him. -Seems to have no concern about the consequences of his actions.-Is impulsive. -Shows frequent signs of being reckless. -Is unpredictable. -Lacks morals. -Is a narcissist. -Has proven to be hot-tempered and a bit of a loose cannon. -Lacks empathy or sympathy for others. -Is manipulative to get what he wants. -Almost never apologizes.-Often invents outrageous lies about his success or experiences. -Seems to believe that what he says is the truth, even if it isn‚Äôt.This describes Trump to a tee. Explain to me why he's the president we need.
2 | Louis Cruz Jr. | 363 | 10155573215316509_10155573225531509 | Born with a silver spoon. Why would anyone listen to this man that finds it easy to shoot an elephant in the forehead for fun.
3 | Lynn Wade | 85 | 10155573215316509_10155573254396509 | A man who has been handed everything in his life complaining about the establishment holding people down! Typical of this campaign and the bs that has accompanied it!! #voteblue #shutitdown
4 | LaRayne Pettus | 74 | 10155573215316509_10155573231551509 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏è
5 | May Amaitalia | 41 | 10155573215316509_10155573282866509 | I hope Trump will leave America as he said earlier during the campaign, if he loses. He can take his whole family and supporters with him, to Russia maybe lol tax collection will rise, so will America's average IQ.
6 | Francisco Jos√© Pansiga Junior Pansiga | 34 | 10155573215316509_10155573248646509 | Trump is not worth anything, Trump will always be a racist or terrorist. European Union has already declared support for Hillary Clinton, Argentine people and Brazilians are with Hillary Clinton the most ethical .
7 | Randy Lee | 60 | 10155573215316509_10155573220636509 | Obama doubled our national debt and he more than doubled our health insurance cost.Not sure why Democrats are ok with that.
8 | Michael Ascani | 20 | 10155573215316509_10155573231691509 | So I have the one question to all and every promise you're making, Which is many. HOW? How is are you going to solve them? Saying Hillary didn't, isn't going to and/or has done it wrong. Doesn't explain HOW! Tell us HOW you're going to solve them Donald. You can't because you don't have a clue.Donald Trump is the greatest snake oil salesman ever.He‚Äôs trying to sell America that he is going to solve all America‚Äôs problems, that he is America‚Äôs savior.He has degraded almost every facet of America‚Äôs culture using racism, bigotry and hatred.Donald Trump is a facade.
9 | Michael Fox | 23 | 10155573215316509_10155573242566509 | The only problem with your well researched list is TRUMP üá∫üá∏ never broke the law. Your candidate, Hillary makes NIXON look like a Boy Scout.
10 | Patricia Stepp | 25 | 10155573215316509_10155573226311509 | Today is the day to keep America moving forward not back...,.For the generation before me. JFK AND MLKFor my generation who had those big shoes to follow.For the generation after. The kids that had the courage to "come out"For the generation after that, that was progressive enough to support everyone's rights.For our children Who are fighting bullies every day. Who are STANDING UP, moving forward . Lets not knock them back to ground zero.For their kids. Lets keep the rights of all equal and progressive.........
11 | Matt Steele | 23 | 10155573215316509_10155573235026509 | I am more worried what Trump will do if he loses. He might try to start a civil war with his new brainless army he has created.
12 | Chris Chappell | 13 | 10155573215316509_10155573266916509 | The young idiot best prepare himself for a defeat and tell everyone that his father will go back to shafting everyone off and robbing the poor when it's all over lmao Dump the Trump

14 | Jane Borthwick-swanek | 8 | 10155573215316509_10155573262566509 | Roommate in College.......‚ÄúAs many of you know, I attended the University of Pennsylvania with Donald Trump Jr. I feel compelled to share this story before the election, in the hopes that it will shed a bit of light on the kind of person that Donald Trump is, and the kind of son that he raised.I was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends, next door to Donald Jr.‚Äôs room. I walked out of the room to find Donald Trump at his son‚Äôs door, there to pick him up for a baseball game. There were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate. Don Jr. opened the door, wearing a Yankee jersey. Without saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all his classmates. He simply said ‚Äúput on a suit and meet me outside,‚Äù and closed the door.Donald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking. He absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him. his nickname was ‚ÄúDiaper Don,‚Äù because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other people‚Äôs beds and urinate. I always felt terrible for him.I am voting for Hillary Clinton for a number of reasons, her opponent notwithstanding. However, in light of what I saw that day, it is clear to me that Donald Trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country.‚Äù
15 | Leo van Veldhuizen | 7 | 10155573215316509_10155573451996509 | Who cares what this little cross eyed wanker has to say. His orange pervert old man is disgusting and the apple did not fall far from the tree. The old pervert will say anything to get elected. The little pervert actually believes it.
16 | Carl Christensen | 10 | 10155573215316509_10155573255611509 | Just remember, Donald J. Trump has not killed anybody, he has followed all federal laws regarding his taxes and business exchanges. People need to wake up and realize that how bad the current government is and what they are trying to do. Stop being brain washed by the media and do some research about the candidate they are voting for. Don't vote just because a woman is running. Remember, everybody wants free things however, somebody somewhere has paid for the thing. eventually, the workers will stop working and slaves will be born again to feed the rich. #NeverHillary #GiveAmericaAChanceAgain #MAGA
17 | Sharon Canty Ballestero | 4 | 10155573215316509_10155573252741509 | Even if you do not like Hilary, please get out to vote for those running locally.  We also need to remember that district attorneys, delegates, members of Congress and Sheriff's to name a few, all have an impact on what is done in your community.  Let's make sure we elect great people to represent us!!
18 | Cheri Keaster | 2 | 10155573215316509_10155573949681509 | Father God, we thank you for Mr. Trump. We ask Lord for a hedge of protection around him, his family, and his campaign. We pray that you anoint his steps, and every word from his mouth. Give him strength, clarity, wisdom, and boldness. Expose, strike down and destroy all evil enemies that would attempt to come against him in any way. Bless him, O Lord, and give him VICTORY in all battles that he may face. Father, turn America back to the only living God that has so richly blessed her, and on which this nation was founded. We give you all the praise, glory, and honor in Jesus Holy Name, we pray, Amen!
19 | Angellos Ioannis Malefakis | 2 | 10155573215316509_10155573540066509 | This election is rigged! CNN is a part of the rigging process!  Americans are not giving a choice! CNN should have gone out of its way and invited the other two independent candidates in the debate! To select Hillary or Trump is NOT a choice! They are the two worse candidates in recent history!
20 | Paul Stokes | 7 | 10155573215316509_10155573228816509 | Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (and has cheated on his wives). Elect him. Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. Put her in jail. 2 Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem. Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State). So savvy... Put him in the white house. Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz. Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible. Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is.Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support him and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact. Your memes are not news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform.
21 | Lisa King | 5 | 10155573215316509_10155573233006509 | So....USA has more freedom of thought than anywhere else in the world, Chris????....ever been to Canada? The word for today, boys and girls is...MYOPIC.
22 | Kim Fregia | 0 | 10155573215316509_1831373667106931 | Says the man who said it would be a step down for his family to live in the White House. Okay, I get that. They live in a golden tower and have mansions worldwide. But he's missing the point. It's an honor and privilege to be President and live in the White House. It was an ignorant and asinine thing to say.
23 | Angelina G Contreras Enciso | 1 | 10155573215316509_1831367600440871 | So glad this election is almost over!‚Ä¶ I don't think in my lifetime that Americans were truly realize we deserve much more than examples of the two candidates that we received this year‚Ä¶ Shaking my head disappointed‚Ä¶ Seeing everyone speak to each other with the lack of respect dignity and honor why shouldn't our president represent the people here are who are talking in such a disgusting manner
24 | Renate Hardie | 0 | 10155573215316509_622348224602661 | A man who is a know it all. Arrogant and disrespectful. He has no experience in any civic or government work. He has a bad temper and lacks diplomacy. His only credits are that he built an empire. Yeah on the backs of cheap labor, did not pay his workers etc.....went bankrupt several times and consequently let the little man holding the bag. He is unfit for office.
25 | Joe Porter | 0 | 10155573215316509_622347664602717 | Why CNN is not obliterating Donna Brazile for humiliating them again yesterday on XM radio for saying she'd pass debate questions to Hillary again if she had the chance is why I believe CNN was complicit. Brazile has the goods on them. So disappointed with CNN this past year.

1 | Ryan Adam Stanley | 672 | 10155573127656509_10155573131791509 | Yes cnn. Pump all the anti trump ads out while you can
2 | Lee Alfred Herzog | 399 | 10155573127656509_10155573141936509 | Awe poor clinton news network your on full propaganda swing aren't you. I can't wait to hear your cries of sorrow when America doesn't choose your corrupt leach politician candidate. Cheers to the end of Cnn.
3 | John McAuliffe | 269 | 10155573127656509_10155573128376509 | If you are heart-set on voting for genitalia, then vote Jill Stein. At least that way, you won't be electing all the baggage of terrorist-linked finance and corruption you get with Hillary. You want your sons and daughters to read in the history books about the first woman president actually being worthy of the role and seeing it through to the end without legal issues and possible impeachment.
4 | Tabatha Worthey | 188 | 10155573127656509_10155573149036509 | You used to be a legitimate news carrier but now your just part of the Clinton mafia. Regardless of who wins...people have seen the way you and your network have done - you all are as crooked as she is
5 | Raffaella Luca | 137 | 10155573127656509_10155573136961509 | the fact that economists, singers and push Europeans to vote Clinton, makes me realize how important it is voting for Trump. Unfortunately will win Clinton. Americans love corruption. I thought that Italy was the most corrupt country. Bullshits!
6 | Gordon Taylor | 62 | 10155573127656509_10155573157166509 | We see the crappy economy of Mr. Obama, the worst economy in the history of the country (any TRUTH telling economists will tell you that) so I call bull crap on your "economists". Under Mr. Obama, and Mrs. Clinton would follow, the very rich got much richer, us poor slobs got poorer. Hell no to Hillary.
7 | Aaron Dow Rogers | 60 | 10155573127656509_10155573142466509 | I miss the days of media bias by omission.  ... at least it was a little bit of a challenge to figure out when the media was being bias.  Now it is just full on, unabashed, campaign mode all out there for everyone to see.
8 | Megan Brin | 34 | 10155573127656509_10155573188426509 | Know this CNN. I have been a follower of your network for yrs. Have watched every single day for probably 6/7 years. I can assure you, after today, I am done tuning in. I can not for the life of me figure out why you decided not to be true and honest reporters on both sides and share unbiased news to everyone regardless to who we all wanted. I tuned in to get all news regardless to whose agenda it fit or not.  I always respected your network. That is all lost now. Corrupt and bought out like everything else in our Country. Fox News out reported you and all but one reporter of theirs shared all news, from all sides, very unbiased. I know you may not care what I am saying but I really think you made a deal that will end your Network as how you have known it. See the only reason I have continued to check in, is to see what comments are under your very biased articles. The funny thing is it is 10/1 not in your favor. I hope people delete you as soon as this is over and never turn on their televisions to you again. Sad, I even had you programmed in to come on everyday when hitting the "on" button.
9 | LaRayne Pettus | 29 | 10155573127656509_10155573169161509 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏è
10 | Jackie Speetjens | 31 | 10155573127656509_10155573146596509 | If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty. If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much? Who is left? üëÅ VOTE TRUMP!!!

12 | Han Ming | 12 | 10155573127656509_10155573146056509 | Trump is better ! He use his money to run for presidential elections and not funded by firearms vendors! He can make a bold decision to introduce gun control policy! Hope he will be elected!
13 | Mike Mikels | 8 | 10155573127656509_10155573147046509 | Come on Ohioans. A president hasn't been elected since 1964 without winning Ohio. Don't ruin that record by voting for Trump. Get out there and vote for the winner, vote for Hillary and keep the tradition going :D
14 | Edson Brandes | 15 | 10155573127656509_10155573148451509 | Besides bashing Trump the only policy;s I have heard from Hillary are raising taxes , letting 3 times more refugees that want to kill you and open borders ... Gee where do I sign up  LOL ....

16 | Shawne Boring | 6 | 10155573127656509_10155573201426509 | Today is election day. When you go out to vote today and you consider voting for Hillary Clinton. You might want to second-guess your vote. Hillary supports abortion, partial birth abortion at 8 months which is almost term. Now most of you supporters of Hillary will use the excuse that women have the right to abort a baby if they're rapped and that they should have the choice to not carry a child if they are a victim of rape. However all you Hillary supporters ARE against the death penalty. Which is a bit messed up if you think about it. Because you're willing to kill an unborn baby that did nothing wrong but you will not kill the person that raped the woman getting the abortion. So I feel that if you are able to kill an unborn baby who has done nothing wrong but you are against the death penalty to kill an adult man who has killed someone or rape someone and they deserve to the death penalty for what they did, then you are just as bad as Hillary and these rapists and murderers, think about that. Not saying you have to vote for Trump just because he is the other candidate, there are other candidates as well to choose from. So, Choose Wisely. Don't choose Hillary.GET OUT AND VOTE....MAKE A DIFFERENCE....WE NEED CHANGE!!!!NOT MORE OF THE SAME...

His decisions might not be the best short-term for stock,but that's because a lot of folks have world investments. Economists don't care if jobs are moving out of US as long as companies stay afloat. I don't want my g-kids to hv to move to Mex for a job.

23 | Patrick Milam | 4 | 10155573127656509_10155573158056509 | Voting for a tree stump would be a more effective vote than voting for this delusional mad man, who not only is a bigot, racist, sexual predator, but at the end of the day he has no clue what he is doing and has never once actually proposed any solutions as to how he is going to "make america great again!" He just repeats himself over and over without actually saying anything substantial at all! If you vote for him, you yourself are as ignorant and detached from reality as this sack of human waste is!
24 | Phil Madison | 2 | 10155573127656509_10155573236046509 | Stop trying to scare on Election Day. Take a day of from being in bed w/ HRC. Here's a crazy though, let voters think on their own w/ out you trying to manipulate them w/ your voter discouraging scare tactics.

Democrats-:If your hungry, they'll give you a fish today, tomorrow and every day there after.  Republicans: If you're hungry, they'll give you a fish today but teach you to fish tomorrow so that you can become self sufficient.  Democrats like to feel they're helping people survive but that's all it is...survival.  Republicans want you to succeed not just survive.  To become independent and not have to wait with your hand out so that the Democrats can pat you on the back to make themselves feel important.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Charley Clark | 71 | 10155572990656509_10155573005986509 | If you think Hillary has your best interest in mind, your have been fooled. She doesn't care about you, your family, or America's best interest. Is Trump the answer? He is the lesser of 2 evils. Hillary has a mound of corruption piled a mile high and doesn't even try to hide it. And you still blindly support her. They have tried for a year to drum up trash on "Donald Trump For President" and all they can come up with is he said something that hurt my feelings. The Democratic party wants to kill the working middle class. They want 2 social classes. The rich and those whom serve the rich. The media boasts of all the jobs the Democratic party has created. I'm sure they have. I'm sure a Mickey D's burger stand can be found on every street corner in America. Flippin burgers will never get you an annual salary greater than $15k a year. I'm sorry, it takes no skill to cook a greasy flat piece of meat. What about industrial job creation in America? Manufacturing is what brings money into an economy. It creates countless jobs across many area's of expertise. Both during construction and for years down the road. Who ushered in NAFTA? Just like Ross Perot said, NAFTA signed, a vacuum sound erupted and all the jobs left the country. Canada floods the lumber market. The papermills left. Thousands upon thousands of jobs left. Over seas auto manufacturer's came in. That's great you say. Guess what!! The money they earn from the manufacturing goes back to their country. They don't buy supplies from America. They ship it from their own country. Why can America do the same? Trump is the only screaming to take care of our own. All the other countries do it. Except the ones who kill their own. I'm not against immigrants. But you should do your part to help keep America healthy. Not paying taxes, freeloading on the taxpayers dime, and leaching off the government is destroying the country. America has a primary language, it's English!!! It always has been!!! Freedom of religion. I don't push mine on you, don't push yours on me. Obamacare? Oh it's great!!! Just last 3 months ago, my aunt got pneumonia. The hospital discharged her and sent her home. She was covered by Obamacare. The government doesn't care if you live or die. They just want their money and power. And Hillary supports have bought into the lie!! You say we don't want a woman as president. A woman as President is a good idea. But it needs to be a woman with integrity. Someone with a genuine concern with the American peoples well being. Hillary just wants the power and prestige. She's full of greed. That's it and that's all. It's amazing to me how simple the decision is and how uneducated people have become. We have all the information at our finger tips and as a society, we are dumber than we were 100 years ago.
2 | Mishkwageezhigookkwe Tadgwasung | 33 | 10155572990656509_10155573058346509 | I'm endorsing Donald J. Trump Because America is crippled and corrupt everywhere you look. We have huge problems from our national debt to unsafe borders. This is the fault of our crooked government. This truly is our last chance to save our country. Donald Trump brings many years of education and experience to the job of being the president of the United States and will work diligently for us to make this country win again and great again! God bless America and god bless Donald Trump. Trump 2016 üá∫üá∏
3 | Kathleen Olszewski | 4 | 10155572990656509_10155573106146509 | When we will become an honest Nation with one vote per legal aged citizen, with a photo voter ID card? Why this is such an odd concept to the left can only make you question their darker motives....its only logical and good common sense. or be asked for your passport or drivers license...something that requires your photo is not an oddity in todays society with all its other rules and regulations.
4 | Simon To | 7 | 10155572990656509_10155572992806509 | If you want to know what each of the political parties stands for, just look at the demographic of their national delegates at their conventions. That pretty much tells you everything you needs to know about each of these parties
5 | Sam Smith | 0 | 10155572990656509_10155574563966509 | Yeah..I saw those issues...here's mine...I expect the next President, WHOEVER that is, to stand for and support the rights of ALL people on ALL constitutionally protected issues INCLUDING the 10th Amendment. In addition to that, I fully expect that person to enforce the provisions of 10 USC 332&333, that being, if any state or local government is either incapable or unwilling to uphold the laws or constititutional protections of its citizens, that the president shall order the National Guard or Federal troops in to enforce such rights and protections. By the same token, I expect the states to to do the same should the federal government overreach into an area that it has no authority to do so. I am past tired of numerous branches of government, at all levels, working in concert to suppress the rights of the US population in furtherance of their political agenda.
6 | Trish Marie Charlton-Lee | 3 | 10155572990656509_10155573097741509 | I am not a political person and have never been but this is the most important election of Our Lives. For us our kids grandchildren and future grandchildren. Please be mindful when voting. Look for obvious signs of voter fraud as dead people have been voting in your ballots are being changed when you vote. If you don't believe me check out the segment on 6abc where are loved ones who have passed were visited because their loved ones who have passed voted. Also Take into consideration those people who cannot afford Healthcare but very unaffordable Healthcare is being forced down their throat. And don't forget that if they don't take that said Healthcare and have a job they get penalized in their taxes. A minimum of $2,400 is what is lost to that person can I already afford this. A Hillary vote will be nothing but the same. And the same people who cannot afford Healthcare come 2017 will end up paying way more whether they like it or have it. Do not let the corrupt media sway you. They are only telling you what they are paid to tell you. Which is already been proven buy CNN when Hillary was given the questions during the debates. The Obama and Clinton administration is so corrupt. They have constantly lied to the American people and the Clinton administration has stolen taken money from other countries that want to kill us and they do not respect women or gays. They have taken money in exchange for favors from Big Banks big corporations etc. They have used a fake foundation That was supposed to be for good to line their own pockets. This is also been proven by WikiLeaks as they have used it for their daughter's wedding. The money that was supposed to go to Haiti only very little percent went there and the rest went in their pockets. Hillary Clinton has lied to the FBI and the American people during both investigations. The only way the American people found anything out was through WikiLeaks. Had we not had WikiLeaks we would all still be in the dark and would believe that she would be fit for president. She lied and claimed that the Russians were responsible for the leaks in our own private server which was illegal to have in the first place . She lied about her server. Obama lied about knowing about her server. And they both compromise National Security. 5 of America's enemies hack into her server which can put us all in danger. She and Obama paid off and bribed top officials that made it totally impossible for there to be any chance of her being indicted. Whistleblowers are turning up dead left and right under suspicious reasons. Hell she couldn't even be honest when it came to her stealing the White House Furniture that she inevitably had to return LOL. I could keep going but I think I made my point. Do we really want this unfit unethical irresponsible Woman for president? is this what you want for the future of your children?I personally don't care who you vote for as long as it is #neverhillary. Vote for Trump vote for the third party but never Hillary. She is the disease that is going to drain this country. It is going to be more of the same if she is elected. Nothing but corruption and the American people will never be informed of anything unless of course WikiLeaks she's putting her out on Front Street. Which God I hope they still do . And if he is elected president I will bet my bottom dollar that she will be impeached just like her husband was. Please be wise when voting for the future of my kids your kids and our grandchildren. #neverhillary #anybodybutHillaryforpresident #nomorecorruption #onlywecanstopthecorruption
7 | Nwanne Di Uto | 0 | 10155572990656509_10155574443776509 | In this American election Trump said he will cut down Tax, he said he will repeal Obama care which many families can't afford to pay, he said he will bring back jobs to America, he said he will build a wall to stop drugs from overflowing into America, he said Muslims should be banned temporarily from entering American until their leaders explain to them what is really going on, until they explain why killing Americans is and Christians are their main targets, he said he will stop Syria üá∏üáæ refugees not to enter USA üá∫üá∏ in other to safe American citizens from harm, is this why you hate him? if so tell me what good Hillary Clinton said she will do for you Americans, can I know any good thing said by Hillary Clinton. Wake up and vote Trump now for your good future.

10 | Izediunor Usher Ndubuisi | 1 | 10155572990656509_10155573098121509 | I love coming here to read the comments. Some people (like myself at times) are obsessed with reading comments. For example, we find you reading this comment right now, which does not contain any useful information, only curiosity, that drives you to waste your time. Have a good day.
11 | Sam Adams | 1 | 10155572990656509_10155573012116509 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!

13 | Karly Banker | 1 | 10155572990656509_10155573025976509 | I want to say that Obama is a very attractive man. He is actually very hot, but...His policies are dog sh*t and he wasn't the best president.( on a side note..since he was mixed white and black I had so much hope in him that he would unite the races and not divide them like he did which made me feel let down)Matter of fact we haven't had a good president since Reagan who like Trump was just a celebrity. Hopefully Trump wins today, however I believe Hillary will and to those people saying how can a woman be for Trump with his "words" against women" well....How can a Woman be for Hillary who defended a child rapist knowing he was guilty, or who silenced the women that were actually raped by her husband or who supports muslims that only what women seen but never heard and gay people dead? And those are just her crimes against women and gays, her crimes against humanity are on a whole another level. I research the policies and stuff on each person and found that an America where Hillary is the leader is much worse than one with Trump. I would rather have Obama for a 3rd term than Hillary for just 30 days. Please actually research her before voting and don't just vote for her cause she is a woman and you want to live through another historic event, or because the media says so, we can all see how well that got us the first time around. Obama care was so great that now I went from middle class to poor class with the premiums we have to pay now for the "affordable care act".So really research your candidates and do not vote on the popular opinion today.We don't need a first women president what we need is a first woman gay native american president so wait for that before voting blindly. God bless and amen...
14 | Pam Jinn | 2 | 10155572990656509_10155573160541509 | I agree, it's about voting for the lesser of the two evils. But Trump wants to suppress the free press simply because he doesn't like what they say, He even hates Fox. People all over the world are protesting the suppression of the free press, whereas our country is encouraging it.

Because they're using their hatred to cloud their judgement. Everybody needs to know with all what's going on in the world, specially with the Russians. We cannot afford a CLOWN to runs the most powerful country on earth who no clue how the system works. Hillary maybe not perfect, but we will be safe with her...period. I'm with her.

24 | Haffa D Raffa | 2 | 10155572990656509_10155573120391509 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order. The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.
25 | Klaus Reck | 0 | 10155572990656509_10155573199466509 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are ‚Äúmorons,‚Äù ‚Äúidiots,‚Äù ‚Äúimbeciles,‚Äù ‚Äúhuman weeds,‚Äù and ‚Äúmisfits.‚Äù Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump

9 | David Rodriguez | 45 | 10155572886131509_10155572917176509 | Just a reminder about Donald J. Trump.

Re-tweeted anti-African American propaganda created by a white supremacy group. -Played dumb about knowing who former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke was. -Skipped a presidential debate because he was scared of a moderator. -Has, on several occasions, suggested he finds his daughter attractive. -Called a husband doing things like changing diapers and helping with the children, a man ‚Äútrying to be the wife.‚Äù -Has said he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. -Said he can‚Äôt release his tax returns because they‚Äôre currently being audited ‚Äî even though the IRS said that‚Äôs a lie. -Feels he has the right to sexually assault women.These are the classic signs of a sociopath. -Doesn‚Äôt believe the rules or laws apply to him. -Seems to have no concern about the consequences of his actions.-Is impulsive. -Shows frequent signs of being reckless. -Is unpredictable. -Lacks morals. -Is a narcissist. -Has proven to be hot-tempered and a bit of a loose cannon. -Lacks empathy or sympathy for others. -Is manipulative to get what he wants. -Almost never apologizes.-Often invents outrageous lies about his success or experiences. -Seems to believe that what he says is the truth, even if it isn‚Äôt.This describes Trump to a tee. Explain to me why he's the president we need.

He makes fun of people and where is it ok to call people like Marco Rubio  or others names?  It is not ok and especially if you are running for President....Just think of the mess he will cause with the other countries and we will be in WWIII!!!   Vote Hillary Clinton, she has been in the White House and knows the right people to get the job done and yes....no matter what others say, she does CARE!   Good Luck to Hillary and I pray the undecided vote for her for our country to be safe...I am sorry to the Trump supporters, but one day you will thank us.

21 | Karen Baker | 9 | 10155572886131509_10155572940646509 | Hillary is against Christians, against protecting your family, for transgenderism, aborting full term babies, government controlled family, government controlled healthcare, mercy killings, euthanasia, planned parenthood, selling baby parts.. she is demonic.... dna manipulation, crossbreeding human with animals.. sick sick.. we have to clean up this swamp...
22 | Trish Marie Charlton-Lee | 3 | 10155572886131509_1781195115472354 | I am not a political person and have never been but this is the most important election of Our Lives. For us our kids grandchildren and future grandchildren. Please be mindful when voting. Look for obvious signs of voter fraud as dead people have been voting in your ballots are being changed when you vote. If you don't believe me check out the segment on 6abc where are loved ones who have passed were visited because their loved ones who have passed voted. Also Take into consideration those people who cannot afford Healthcare but very unaffordable Healthcare is being forced down their throat. And don't forget that if they don't take that said Healthcare and have a job they get penalized in their taxes. A minimum of $2,400 is what is lost to that person can I already afford this. A Hillary vote will be nothing but the same. And the same people who cannot afford Healthcare come 2017 will end up paying way more whether they like it or have it. Do not let the corrupt media sway you. They are only telling you what they are paid to tell you. Which is already been proven buy CNN when Hillary was given the questions during the debates. The Obama and Clinton administration is so corrupt. They have constantly lied to the American people and the Clinton administration has stolen taken money from other countries that want to kill us and they do not respect women or gays. They have taken money in exchange for favors from Big Banks big corporations etc. They have used a fake foundation That was supposed to be for good to line their own pockets. This is also been proven by WikiLeaks as they have used it for their daughter's wedding. The money that was supposed to go to Haiti only very little percent went there and the rest went in their pockets. Hillary Clinton has lied to the FBI and the American people during both investigations. The only way the American people found anything out was through WikiLeaks. Had we not had WikiLeaks we would all still be in the dark and would believe that she would be fit for president. She lied and claimed that the Russians were responsible for the leaks in our own private server which was illegal to have in the first place . She lied about her server. Obama lied about knowing about her server. And they both compromise National Security. 5 of America's enemies hack into her server which can put us all in danger. She and Obama paid off and bribed top officials that made it totally impossible for there to be any chance of her being indicted. Whistleblowers are turning up dead left and right under suspicious reasons. Hell she couldn't even be honest when it came to her stealing the White House Furniture that she inevitably had to return LOL. I could keep going but I think I made my point. Do we really want this unfit unethical irresponsible Woman for president? is this what you want for the future of your children?I personally don't care who you vote for as long as it is #neverhillary. Vote for Trump vote for the third party but never Hillary. She is the disease that is going to drain this country. It is going to be more of the same if she is elected. Nothing but corruption and the American people will never be informed of anything unless of course WikiLeaks she's putting her out on Front Street. Which God I hope they still do . And if he is elected president I will bet my bottom dollar that she will be impeached just like her husband was. Please be wise when voting for the future of my kids your kids and our grandchildren. #neverhillary #anybodybutHillaryforpresident #nomorecorruption #onlywecanstopthecorruption

Trump owns a large corporation that does business all over the world. His clothing line is being manufacture overseas. Trump make's millions licensing his name and a lot of people who brought the rights to the licenses in other countries has very questionable character. Trump is part of that elitist society here in America and Trump has a very questionable history, some says he's corrupt. Trump feels that a woman place is in the home not at a work place. He also feels that only a White man can hold any leadership position in America. So, when you spread your new theories just make them more believable.

If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.

13 | Bobby Lamb | 20 | 10155572689511509_10155572694921509 | Trump's only expertise lies in selling the Trump 'brand'.Donald Trump is, in effect, a modern day snake oil salesman. He claims he can cure the disease that the doctors can't. (That is, he claims to be able to fix the problems in this country that those in political power for the last half century have been unable to fix.)He used confederates in the crowd (conservative politicians and conservative news outlets), to legitimize his claims.He stokes the crowd by using exaggeration and fear.Like a snake oil salesman, Trump's product (his ability) would fail to work. It is possible to judge Trump's ability by watching the reaction of those with access to him.The most telling regarding Trump's lack of ability is the recent exodus of support from those in the upper tiers of the Republican Party.Keep in mind how significant it is for any high-ranking Republican to disavow the party's presidential candidate.At the very least, recognize that the two living Republican Presidents, people who at one time headed the Republican party, for who allowing the White House to remain in the hands of the Democrats should be unthinkable, and who know the awesome responsibility of the office of the President, have not endorsed Trump. Realize that this means that the Bushes see Trump as incapable of doing the job of president himself AND of being unable (or unwilling) to surround himself with credible experts who could assure that the functions of the office are carried out.It is a mistake to believe that because Trump is a successful businessman (which in itself is debatable), he will be a success in Washington. Long term politicians at the national level, for all of the (deserved) hatred heaped on them, have a skill set. Specifically, they understand how political power in Washington, and in the world, works.Democracy, as practiced in America, is a delicate thing. Most successful democracies are based on a parliamentary system. Democracies of the type practiced in America have a tendency to fall into dictatorships. A key component that allows our democracy to work is compromise. The Tea Party, with its belief that it could get everything it wanted without having to compromise, has been a microcosmic example of how a democracy can start on the path to failure (via gridlock) by ignoring the need for, and power of, compromise. Trump has not shown an interest in, or even an understanding of, the critical importance of compromise in our system.As for making America great again, I'm not sure what that means. To Trump, part of that appears to mean kicking a bunch of people out of the country, and keeping others from getting in. There is a lot wrong with that idea. It ignores the fact that part of our country's vitality, innovation, and strength comes from the combination of ideas and ambition of immigrants. The greatest concern in this arena is Trump's proclamations as to how he will address immigration through mass deportations. I'd caution that the rights and freedoms that the majority of Americans enjoy are a function of the protections that we afford to the weakest and most marginalized members of our society, whether those members are citizens or not. Once due process can be stripped from any minority group in this country, it is relatively easy to marginalize and strip away the rights of subsets of the majority.

15 | Mike Guirlando | 18 | 10155572689511509_10155572720381509 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016

18 | Burns Kelli | 0 | 10155572689511509_1772937362973636 | ‚ö†If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ ‚ö†If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment? ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ

21 | Michael Garbacz | 7 | 10155572689511509_10155572791206509 | I can't begin to tell CNN how unprofessional they've been during this election. They aren't alone in there faults but I've been a fan of CNN for a number of years now because I wanted, no needed a more unbiased news network. I'm not even going to include fox in this because they are so biased I don't believe anything from that network, but as for the rest I found the way they handled the election coverage unsettling. Facts should've been the only thing reported. This election is what it is because of the coverage by the networks. I'm in no way say they're crooked blah blah blah. I'm saying when you allow lies to go unchecked and when you let guest or surrogates off of the questions asked just so they can preach their candidates speech of the day your doing more damage than good. I understand that you have 24 hrs a day to fill, but that would be quite easy if you only allowed the facts to be presented and you maybe reported on some of the important news of the day. Maybe CNN just needs a better programmer, maybe it's time for all of the 24hr new networks to change their mind set, because the only reason don Trump is even close in this race is because of the 24hr new networks. If you all properly reported on him and maybe didn't hand him free time on your networks he may have had to do a little work for his supporters. What would've happened if you all just stopped airing his speeches when he threatened you or when he turned his mob on you?  You all made a super hero out of the most grossly incompetent person to ever run for the potus. You also made the most qualified person to ever run for potus out to be a crooked, untrustworthy incompetent candidate. You did that, your job should've been and should always be to deliver the truth to any one willing to listen. That's it, I just had to vent my disgust of this years election coverage.

13 | Illi Iver | 1 | 10155572610991509_10155572691261509 | Hillary will win many zombies thanks to CNN, FBI, NBC and others. 300 million brilliant minds but she is tailor-made for Wall Street.
14 | Karly Banker | 0 | 10155572610991509_10155573027516509 | I want to say that Obama is a very attractive man. He is actually very hot, but...His policies are dog sh*t and he wasn't the best president.( on a side note..since he was mixed white and black I had so much hope in him that he would unite the races and not divide them like he did which made me feel let down)Matter of fact we haven't had a good president since Reagan who like Trump was just a celebrity. Hopefully Trump wins today, however I believe Hillary will and to those people saying how can a woman be for Trump with his "words" against women" well....How can a Woman be for Hillary who defended a child rapist knowing he was guilty, or who silenced the women that were actually raped by her husband or who supports muslims that only what women seen but never heard and gay people dead? And those are just her crimes against women and gays, her crimes against humanity are on a whole another level. I research the policies and stuff on each person and found that an America where Hillary is the leader is much worse than one with Trump. I would rather have Obama for a 3rd term than Hillary for just 30 days. Please actually research her before voting and don't just vote for her cause she is a woman and you want to live through another historic event, or because the media says so, we can all see how well that got us the first time around. Obama care was so great that now I went from middle class to poor class with the premiums we have to pay now for the "affordable care act".So really research your candidates and do not vote on the popular opinion today.We don't need a first women president what we need is a first woman gay native american president so wait for that before voting blindly. God bless and amen...

It is inconceivable that anyone could buy into the lies, deceit, fraud, corruption and collusion that completes Hillary's resume. It is inconceivable that anyone would ignore the issues that have plagued and continue to plague Hillary. It is inconceivable that anyone would not see the value that Donald Trump will bring to our nation - true and proven leadership, a track record of success and accomplishment, and the promise to return government to the people where it belongs and curtail the globalism that Hillary is working towards.

1 | J√°nos Hal√°sz | 1060 | 10155572553616509_10155572557666509 | I was supporting Hillary in the primaries all the way. Later it was revealed that she and DNC operatives colluded to rig the result in her favor. This is not OK and not a part of a civil society or democracy. Sadly, I have to vote for Donald Trump because I cannot condone this level of corruption.
2 | Eduard Van Zweeden | 303 | 10155572553616509_10155572565571509 | Trump needs to be POTUS ! America is in trouble it prints money it does not have! America itself is corrupt! Wall Street is over valued! The dollar is artificially strong , because if you disagree you get war declared
3 | Laura Langa-Spencer | 258 | 10155572553616509_10155572564726509 | Anybody who's ever worked anywhere near publishing knows that magazines, newspapers, have to prepare both sides in advance. Such a non issue
4 | Greg Bradshaw | 122 | 10155572553616509_10155572594691509 | Pretty sad that this needs to be explained to the simple-minded...oh, well they're fed a steady diet of conspiracy theories. Clearly stunted their growth. It'll also surprise them that Cleveland Indian World Series Champions t-shirts were pre-printed too, alongside Cubs ones. Shocker!
5 | Meej Xyooj | 116 | 10155572553616509_10155572557541509 | It's only rigged if Clinton win. But if Trump wins....that's the people's choice.Hypocrites
6 | Nicholas Idowu | 94 | 10155572553616509_10155572558901509 | if the United State of America could wait this long to have a female president then your Democratic institutions needs more reforms... These are norms in other countries
7 | John Anthony Lopez | 50 | 10155572553616509_10155572562231509 | As I go to bed I can only hope that we make the right decision tomorrow. The Presidency of the United States has always been seen as a prestigious position admired the world over. It is not something to be taken lightly. The scar of 9/11 was the first signal that we are not invincible although we'd like to think so. Since that very day America has seen a decline not only economically but spiritually, and more importantly morally. This is an attitude that only WE can change, it is of the utmost importance because a society is not conquered from without but from within. When the people cease to believe, when confusion and fear grips society and prevents it from seeing clearly. This is when it loses its power and its vision. So I urge you to vote, and vote wisely because this time the damage will be internally and the repercussions will last for years to come. I urge you to leave your prejudices aside, and hate and fears. Think of the future, think of what the world expects of us. The righteousness that we always exuberate and how we have always make a difference. There are no terrorists, there are no antagonist. This time the ball is in our court. Vote.
8 | Ray Delgado | 60 | 10155572553616509_10155572575421509 | Copy from Facebook page of Kevin M Carney(opposing Views.) A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!

12 | Grace Beckham | 18 | 10155572553616509_10155572621151509 | Dear Hillary Supporters PLEASE SHARE! Pay no attention to Trump Trolls and Conspiracy Wing-nuts! Their ship is sinking, and as their desperation and frustration at backing a losing candidate grows, so does their hate and resentment of women, Hillary and her supporters. They just can't believe that the overwhelming majority of American voters back a vetted and experienced candidate with credibility issues vs. a sexual predator, racist, toxic xenophobic, con man and habitual liar and whiney, immature man child. In 4 years they'll get another chance to run against Hillary, but for now....let them level baseless accusations, blame, vent, hold their collective breath and stomp their feet. These emails mean nothing, change NOTHING, and it's all they have!
13 | Sue Pate | 20 | 10155572553616509_10155572787781509 | Hillary Clinton is a corrupt liar, she is for open borders, running a pay to play operation through Clinton foundation, stoled billions from Haiti relief fund, 6 billion went missing from the federal reserve while she was Secretary of State, she sold uranium to Russia and pocketed the money into the Clinton foundation, she got Americans killed in Benghazi, she armed Isis, she is for full term abortions, over 46 suspicious deaths of people in the Clinton circle, accepts money from foreign governments and last week she transferred 1.8 billion dollars from the Clinton foundation to Qatar (you don't get rich in politics üòâ), so why the sudden transfer and where did that money come from? The Haiti relief fund money?The Saudi's ?The money missing under her watch as Secretary of State? All the money from pay to play?Or maybe from Russia when she sold them US uranium? It amazes me how all these facts are out there and people still vote for this corrupt liar! ü§î
14 | Ernest Hoskins | 13 | 10155572553616509_10155572662271509 | What ever the outcome of this election, it will be years before CNN will have any credibility. It's sad that when you come to CNN to get some actual news and all you get is gossip from trump said this or abc news polls show that. It's sad that you have to fact check a news organization because they are so biased and people surprisingly don't see it. The vast majority of trumps speeches they edit and cut little pieces and phrases to make it seem like he said racists and sexist things.
15 | Tiffany Martin Bishop | 13 | 10155572553616509_900148920087351 | Why, yet again I ask why, is CNN always defending Killary?!? It would have been great to see the same unbiased support for both candidates! Oh wait! Clinton News Network is just another of her baby minions!!
16 | Ronald Kwiatkowski | 14 | 10155572553616509_10155572599866509 | I will not say Hillary represents love. But Trump represents hate.You vote Trump, you vote hate.You‚Äôll be the United States of Hate.

Say what you want, but when u support him u are complicit in his racism and demagoguery! What does that say about u? Bunch of "Sad Sacks"

19 | Christi Wentz | 5 | 10155572553616509_10155572596781509 | This is something that literally happens every election so they can get the issue out asap regardless of who wins.

22 | Tyla Souza | 1 | 10155572553616509_900150170087226 | Those of us with common sense already knew this. Its just those who are suddenly political only during election years that fell for this. Bernie Sanders supporters are a nest of those people. Not that all sanders supporters were but the vast majority. They never knew who he was before then, but all of a sudden they are political fanatics. I mean these people got upset when he endorsed Clinton ... like wtf ? Anybody who truly follows politics already knew he was going too. That's how it works, a candidate wins the nomination and the losers endorse them. But they acted so shocked lol. That's how you knew they had no idea wtf they were talking about when it came to politics lol
23 | Alisha Gamboa | 2 | 10155572553616509_1763068517289491 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.
24 | Gary Oakley | 1 | 10155572553616509_10155572661811509 | Early voting has started in most states, so make sure you get-out-the-vote! Share this information with your family, bring a friend to the voting locations, and no matter what, make sure you cast a vote that you can be proud of.Now is the time to stand up to the two-party duopoly! VOTE Johnson/Weld!
25 | Dimas Jose Mou | 2 | 10155572553616509_570003253185529 | There's no doubt that the election could be rigged.if democrats could manipulate Sanders in favour of madam libya in the primary election,then,there is possibility of doing the same thing against Trump.majority of americans will not vote for madam libya.but if they announce her the winner,then there must be something behind it.

What a ridiculous statement she makes. I work in retail while I go to school, trust me, I'm sure I'm making someone very rich, but that's what I applied for until I can find something better after school. Honestly it's the crazy the mentality some people have.

She Belongs in Federal Prison already!!The 25 things that are truly important about Hillary instead of this left wing fluff:1. When did she know her husband was a serial abuser, and does she feel guilty for destroying his accusers?2. Explain precisely the trades made in the Cattle Futures scandal where $1,000 was turned into $99,000 in a matter of weeks?3. Why didn't she do anything to protect the Americans in Benghazi?4. Who is Saul Alinsky and why was he her mentor?5. When she was working on Watergate, why did her boss Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, call Hillary a ‚Äúliar‚Äù and ‚Äúan unethical, dishonest lawyer‚Äù and have her fired?6. What really happened with Travelgate?7. What really happened with the Rose Law Firm?8. What really happened with WhiteWater?9. What gave Hillary the right to see private FBI files of her political enemies in FileGate?10. Why won't she turn over her illegal server with state department e-mails to congress?11. Why does your foundation accept money from avowed terror states?12. What is her take on the Vince Foster "Suicide"?13. Why did she think she was entitled to steal the White House furniture when she left?14. Why do you lie even about things that mean nothing: lying about being under sniper fire in Bosnia, lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, or lying that your grandparents were immigrants.15. Should America be concerned that in ChinaGate, the 22 people that were convicted of fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the DNC were associates of Bill Clinton?16. Did selling stays at the Lincoln Bedroom to political donors make you feel like a wh)o(re?17. Does Hillary think Juanita Broadrick lied when she said on national news that Bill Clinton raped her?18. Is she still okay that Bill goes to pedophile island with Jeff Epstein?19. Why are there so many murdered and suicided people in the Clinton's immediate circle?20. Doesn't the fact that the Clinton Foundation has to amend 5 years of its tax returns for improper reporting imply that you were involved in an illegal RICO enterprise?21. Doesn't approving the Russian-owned Uranium One deal as secretary of state--because of illegal contributions to your foundation--in fact make you a traitor to this country?22. Was it wise to have at least four Clinton Foundation board of directors that have either been convicted or charged of the financial crimes of bribery and fraud?23. Why, Hillary, did you pay your female senate staffers 72% of what you paid your male staffers?24. When you represented an accused pedophile rapist, why did you laugh when you got him off even though you believed him to be guilty?25. She said she had one e-mail address, it came out that she had two; She said she had one device, it came out that she had two: She said none of her e-mails on her private server was classified, but when the State Dept handed over 300 e-mails the FBI redacted large sections of one, proving again she was wrong. Thus, Ms. Clinton, are you incompetent or just a congenital liar?Everyone should go on you tube and watch The Clinton Chronicles -- it will amaze you what a couple of psychopaths the Clintons really are!

Trump is successful and it shows by his wealth. Why be mad? All of us have the same opportunities, but we choose our path in life. I chose to be a stay at home mom, and my husband works in EMS. To be a full time mom I chose to sacrifice my income, and live on what my husband makes which in EMS isn't a lot. Trump can turn this nation around!

She had to resign her job as secutary of state due to stress because the stress of the job was too much for her, but the real reason is obama had to replace her because she did such a horrible job at it. Shes already failed once but she acts like shes entitled to the presidency for some reason.
19 | Nghia Nguyen | 2 | 10155572501706509_10155572697201509 | Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."

25 | Magnus R√∂nnkvist | 4 | 10155572501706509_10155572546616509 | Perhaps a better title for this video would be "meet the ex-employees of Mr Trump" as they most likely lost their jobs after this video interview was published.

This election more than anything is about the appointment of the supreme court justices.. who will decide the course of this country for decades.. so its not just a choice between Hillary and Trump.. its Much much more than that ...

6 | Greg Amerson | 16 | 10155572443436509_10155572476351509 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

13 | Johnny Mendoza | 7 | 10155572443436509_10155572458061509 | How quickly we forget!  If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten.  If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
14 | Nwanne Di Uto | 1 | 10155572443436509_10155574453471509 | In this American election Trump said he will cut down Tax, he said he will repeal Obama care which many families can't afford to pay, he said he will bring back jobs to America, he said he will build a wall to stop drugs from overflowing into America, he said Muslims should be banned temporarily from entering American until their leaders explain to them what is really going on, until they explain why killing Americans is and Christians are their main targets, he said he will stop Syria üá∏üáæ refugees not to enter USA üá∫üá∏ in other to safe American citizens from harm, is this why you hate him? if so tell me what good Hillary Clinton said she will do for you Americans, can I know any good thing said by Hillary Clinton. Wake up and vote Trump now for your good future.

We have huge problems from our national debt to unsafe borders. This is the fault of our crooked government. This truly is our last chance to save our country. Donald Trump brings many years of education and experience to the job of being the president of the United States and will work diligently for us to make this country win again and great again!

22 | Weston Colton Sampson | 2 | 10155572443436509_10155572488346509 | Hey everyone I need to talk to you guys and this concerned me very very much. This might not included you but I still want people to hear this. Last night I was watching a video about Donald Trump. Every day Donald trump say something racist or rude or hate full. He calls women fat ugly disgusting pigs. I would think that all those men out their would love their wives and their girlfriends or even their daughters and mothers and sisters. Trump will make all those women in your family look just like trash he's a sexist who completely disrespects women. Another thing that has hurt me and my loved ones and even my boyfriend Was that he absolutely hates the LGBTQ community. Donald j trump quotes "I absolutely hate gays and i am not in favor of gay marriage. Trump and pence plane to revoke the protection over the LGBTQ community and make it illegal for gay marriage. But this is not all. Medicare will be taken away from those family's who struggle every month to feed their children and to bring their child or children to the hospital and with no Medicare for family's would make it the worst struggle ever but not also will people and family's struggle to keep their homes, apartment, condo, anything that Medicare takes care of. Ladies and gentlemen Donald trump will bring America down. We've built up to be the greatest people ever of America. We have peace with almost 90% of the world population. We have jobs opening every day for people to work and make the lives around them better then ever. But with trump America will fall back a couple of steps and have to start over. #gayrightsmatter  #womenmatter #hilaryclinton #fuckdonaldtrump #keepthepeace
23 | Betsy Nesbit | 1 | 10155572443436509_10155572803981509 | Well maybe she should tell us why we should vote for her and what has she accomplished rather than insulting trump. we know all about him already because the media won't leave him alone.
24 | Karly Banker | 0 | 10155572443436509_10155573028536509 | I want to say that Obama is a very attractive man. He is actually very hot, but...His policies are dog sh*t and he wasn't the best president.( on a side note..since he was mixed white and black I had so much hope in him that he would unite the races and not divide them like he did which made me feel let down)Matter of fact we haven't had a good president since Reagan who like Trump was just a celebrity. Hopefully Trump wins today, however I believe Hillary will and to those people saying how can a woman be for Trump with his "words" against women" well....How can a Woman be for Hillary who defended a child rapist knowing he was guilty, or who silenced the women that were actually raped by her husband or who supports muslims that only what women seen but never heard and gay people dead? And those are just her crimes against women and gays, her crimes against humanity are on a whole another level. I research the policies and stuff on each person and found that an America where Hillary is the leader is much worse than one with Trump. I would rather have Obama for a 3rd term than Hillary for just 30 days. Please actually research her before voting and don't just vote for her cause she is a woman and you want to live through another historic event, or because the media says so, we can all see how well that got us the first time around. Obama care was so great that now I went from middle class to poor class with the premiums we have to pay now for the "affordable care act".So really research your candidates and do not vote on the popular opinion today.We don't need a first women president what we need is a first woman gay native american president so wait for that before voting blindly. God bless and amen...

I agree it's time for a woman president but no way in hell could it be Hillary Clinton!
9 | Dexter Sam | 29 | 10155572384616509_10155572397711509 | I think this election is a choice between war and Peace.. Hillary has already made it clear she is going to enforce no fly zone in syria which means War... so the choice is clear.. do you want WAR or PEACE... The other most single important thing in this election is the appointment of the Supreme court Justices which will decide the course of this country for years to come.. As trivial as it may sound.. these judges will also decide who uses which locker rooms and rest rooms.. so decide carefully and think about your kids and their futures...

Yes have a woman as president, but not Hillary. Beyonc√© sang for Obamas elections, 'Vote Obama because he is black, and I'm black'. Now its 'Vote for Hillary because she is a woman, and I'm a woman'. Surely politics is about more than this.

15 | Alberto Grimaldi | 6 | 10155572384616509_10155572404586509 | 10 QUESTIONS for HILLARY:(1). "When you left the White House after your husband‚Äôs last term as president, why did you steal $200,000.00 worth of furniture, china, and artwork? And why did you tell the public that you ‚Äòreturned it‚Äô when you only brought back $27,000 of it? (2). Mrs. Clinton, when you were Secretary of State, why did you solicit contributions from foreign governments, (muslim princes donated multi-millions and got favors in return) for the Clinton Foundation after you promised President Obama you would not?(3). Mrs. Clinton, why do you and your husband claim to contribute millions of dollars to charity for a tax write off when it goes directly into your Clinton Foundation which only gives out 10% of the funds to charitable purposes and you pocket the balance to support yourself tax free? What does your daughter Chelsea do there for her 3 million dollar yearly salary? (4). Mrs. Clinton, why are you unable to account for 6 billion dollars of State department funds that seem to have disappeared while you were Secretary of State?(5). Mrs. Clinton why did you say you were broke when you left the White House, but purchased a 5 million home, built an addition for the secret service, and charge the tax payers of the United States $15,000.00 a month for their rent, an amount that pays your the entire mortgage?(6). Mrs. Clinton why did you lie to the American people about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, but managed to tell the truth to your daughter that same night it happened?(7). Mrs Clinton were you and your husband disbarred from practicing law? Answer: In 1996, Landmark Legal Foundation filed a complaint asking the court to disbar Hillary Clinton for violating the Arkansas code of conduct, (which requires lawyers to act with honesty and integrity) for her actions in the Whitewater scandal cover up. Hillary‚Äôs law license was suspended in 2002 for failing to complete her continuing legal education requirements. Bill Clinton was convicted by a grand jury for perjury and obstruction of justice to which he was impeached by the House of Representatives and disbarred from practicing as an attorney. He has been accused by a dozens of women for rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. He settled out of court for $850.000 in one case. Hillary has him out on her campaign trail championing for her theme of feminism and "women's rights". What a blasphemy. Neither one has enough integrity to hold onto a law license. (8). Mrs Clinton, why did you say, ‚ÄúI do not recall,‚Äù ‚ÄúI have no recollection,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù 56 times while testifying under oath during the Starr investigations.(9). Mrs Clinton, what Really happened to Ron Brown when he was about to testify against you and your husband?(10). Mrs. Clinton what really happened to law partner Vince Foster? No way he committed suicide.

Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds".

She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china.

18 | Charles Hann | 4 | 10155572384616509_10155572398526509 | WHY WE VOTE ... BOTTOM-LINE:Supreme Court appointments are for life. This means that the justices serve until they resign, retire, or die. Therefore, a president able to appoint even one member of the court is able to determine the direction of the country. Especially in the situation that exists at present‚Ä¶The court has voted 5-4 on crucial decisions for years. The swing vote (Scalia) died. The person we elect as president this Tuesday will appoint Scalia‚Äôs replacement‚Äîthe new swing vote.Pay Close Attention: During the next four years of the president‚Äôs term, he or she will likely appoint a second Supreme Court justice. The votes on crucial decisions will then be decided by a vote of 6-3. The opportunity to appoint a third and even a fourth justice to the court will allow whomever we elect on Tuesday the ability to cement the Supreme Court‚Äôs voting‚Äîthink 7-2 or imagine 8-1‚Äîfor as long as you live.These are but a few examples of the two pathways you will choose this Tuesday, November 8, 2016. Religious freedom, taxes and the economy, healthcare‚Ä¶in every category you examine, you‚Äôll find drastic differences in the America that will be shaped by this election. Don‚Äôt be fooled‚Äîhow you vote matters, because the Supreme Court matters.

20 | Nghia Nguyen | 3 | 10155572384616509_10155572745976509 | Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."

22 | Rose McDonald | 1 | 10155572384616509_10155572417706509 | How is it that CNN can call Donna Brazile a cheater for talking to Clinton people, but these same folks have no problem with Cory Lewandowsky still getting a paycheck from Trump and flying around in Trump's private plane? Ms. Brazile said she didn't give the Clinton camp any advance information about the debate questions, that's good enough for me. On the other hand, Lewandowsky brags about getting paid by Trump while working for CNN. Could the different treatment possibly be because Donna Brazile is a strong, intelligent Black, female Democrat and Lewandowsky isn't? The stink of racism, sexism and political bias is all over this.

She Belongs in Federal Prison already!!The 25 things that are truly important about Hillary instead of this left wing fluff:1. When did she know her husband was a serial abuser, and does she feel guilty for destroying his accusers?2. Explain precisely the trades made in the Cattle Futures scandal where $1,000 was turned into $99,000 in a matter of weeks?3. Why didn't she do anything to protect the Americans in Benghazi?4. Who is Saul Alinsky and why was he her mentor?5. When she was working on Watergate, why did her boss Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, call Hillary a ‚Äúliar‚Äù and ‚Äúan unethical, dishonest lawyer‚Äù and have her fired?6. What really happened with Travelgate?7. What really happened with the Rose Law Firm?8. What really happened with WhiteWater?9. What gave Hillary the right to see private FBI files of her political enemies in FileGate?10. Why won't she turn over her illegal server with state department e-mails to congress?11. Why does your foundation accept money from avowed terror states?12. What is her take on the Vince Foster "Suicide"?13. Why did she think she was entitled to steal the White House furniture when she left?14. Why do you lie even about things that mean nothing: lying about being under sniper fire in Bosnia, lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, or lying that your grandparents were immigrants.15. Should America be concerned that in ChinaGate, the 22 people that were convicted of fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the DNC were associates of Bill Clinton?16. Did selling stays at the Lincoln Bedroom to political donors make you feel like a wh)o(re?17. Does Hillary think Juanita Broadrick lied when she said on national news that Bill Clinton raped her?18. Is she still okay that Bill goes to pedophile island with Jeff Epstein?19. Why are there so many murdered and suicided people in the Clinton's immediate circle?20. Doesn't the fact that the Clinton Foundation has to amend 5 years of its tax returns for improper reporting imply that you were involved in an illegal RICO enterprise?21. Doesn't approving the Russian-owned Uranium One deal as secretary of state--because of illegal contributions to your foundation--in fact make you a traitor to this country?22. Was it wise to have at least four Clinton Foundation board of directors that have either been convicted or charged of the financial crimes of bribery and fraud?23. Why, Hillary, did you pay your female senate staffers 72% of what you paid your male staffers?24. When you represented an accused pedophile rapist, why did you laugh when you got him off even though you believed him to be guilty?25. She said she had one e-mail address, it came out that she had two; She said she had one device, it came out that she had two: She said none of her e-mails on her private server was classified, but when the State Dept handed over 300 e-mails the FBI redacted large sections of one, proving again she was wrong. Thus, Ms. Clinton, are you incompetent or just a congenital liar?Everyone should go on you tube and watch The Clinton Chronicles -- it will amaze you what a couple of psychopaths the Clintons really are!
