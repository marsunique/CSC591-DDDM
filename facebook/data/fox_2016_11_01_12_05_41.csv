Hillary is corrupt, she is a liar, she is pure evil!!  She is a disgrace to the USA!!  #hillaryforprison #neverhillary
2 | Monica Spilker | 26 | 10154752897621336_10154753005281336 | On Fox this morning, Trey Gowdy explained the seriousness of the word 'intent'. According to Gowdy, intent equals treason. In July, Comey wanted Hillary found guilty of gross negligence without intent, but the DOJ wouldn't go along with it. Now, Hillary and Huma both face potential charges of treason and that's why Comey had to open the investigation again, despite wanting to save the country from political and emotional chaos.

And the draining of the swamp can begin.

A new poll shows Donald J. Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton 46 to 45 percent in a general election match-up.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Charles R Burkholtz | 263 | 10154752895841336_10154752902761336 | What is sad is that Trump can very well win the popular vote by a substantial margin and still lose the election due to the electoral college system.  It sure would be nice if the voice of We The People was what determined the outcome of an election!!!!!!!!!!!!
2 | April Spring | 213 | 10154752895841336_10154752902941336 | Don't let our election be rigged!THE RED PLEDGE -Let's make our presence known without a doubt on November 8th. I think all Donald Trump supporters should pledge to wear a red shirt all day long on election day and make our presence known.  Let the news media try to avoid a sea of red moving across the whole United States of America! They may be able to rig the machines, but they can't strip countless millions of people of their shirts! There's no way they can deny our collective voices if we make ourselves physically visual!
3 | Dana Roqueta Sherman | 28 | 10154752895841336_10154752921381336 | Yeah right! That lady can't fill a gymnsium and Trump's rallies are tens of thousands of people! Very sweet for the mainstrram media to admit Trump is ahead, but that margin needs to be a little wider....
4 | William Orr | 39 | 10154752895841336_10154752898466336 | Its like people are finally realizing that we probably shouldn't elect a criminal as president.... better late than never I guess
5 | Khriz A Manuel | 31 | 10154752895841336_10154752897836336 | ‚ÄúThis is what life with the Clintons looks like. It‚Äôs always a scandal one after another.‚ÄùSpeaker Paul Ryan says former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton work the system to help themselves.
6 | Andrew Benefield | 25 | 10154752895841336_10154752912646336 | #LOCKHERUP She shouldn't even be on the polls. Really, America does not want that witch as president! Hillary Clinton deserves prison, we don't allow criminals to make the laws, nor should we let them even run for president!! This world is so jacked up, it's time for a change for the better. Bunch of limp wristed pansies in this place, can't do anything without "hurting someone's feelings" or offending someone. Time to grow up people!!
7 | Kathy Cook | 12 | 10154752895841336_10154752938076336 | Don't believe it, it's NO WHERE near this close!! She's leaving HER OWN rallies because the only people showing up are demanding she be LOCKED UP!! Trump Train 2016 üá∫üá∏
8 | Eddie Kay | 26 | 10154752895841336_10154752901371336 | I remember once when my dad gave me money to pay the electricity bill but instead i bought a raffle ticket for a brand new car. When i got home,i explained to my dad what i did and he beat the crap out of me. But the next day,when my dad woke up and opened the door,outside my house was a brand new car. We all cried especially me,because the car was from the electricity company,they were there to cut off the electricity, my dad beat the crap out of me again
9 | Alec Gormley | 15 | 10154752895841336_10154752914161336 | Does Obama come out telling us how our National Security was not compromised by Hillary's careless actions, under his watch. He is neck deep in Hillary's criminal activity. Thank God she got caught before being elected as the new anti christ.
10 | Craig Christopher Cleveland | 13 | 10154752895841336_10154752910361336 | Why would Russia want to help Trump? Russia has done VERY WELL under Obama's rule, Hillary is more of the same plus she helped Russia buy a U.S. Uranium mine. Trump promises a stronger millitary and a stronger economy. Hillary promises division, scandal, corruption, and weakness. Common Sense should tell you that if Russia was trying to influence the election it would be in favor of Hillary not Trump
11 | Kevin Credeur | 12 | 10154752895841336_10154752904981336 | Poll... shmoll......Trump will win by a landslide....these polls are so fixed...they mean nothing....a ploy to make you think she is even in the running....the only thing she is running , is from the Law and Trey Gowdy !!
12 | Jason Showtime Davis | 5 | 10154752895841336_10154752927801336 | We need our scared Republican allies to stand up with us. We have gotten in the mud and fought for this and now we need help winning the states. No more "high road" it's time to fight.
13 | Hubert Chamblee McClure | 9 | 10154752895841336_10154752901316336 | Stupid American voters...- do not read this- listen to us- listen to media- it's Comey's fault- it's Trumps fault- it's Russia's fault- it's the illegal server's fault- you are not to think for yourselves- Trump is a racistwe are losing "control"unsincerely,The democratswhat is that I keep hearing????? IT'S THAT TRAIN....AND IT'S ROLLIN ROLLIN ROLLIN!!!!!
14 | Tom Cooper | 6 | 10154752895841336_10154752908556336 | I hope you will cover the Danny Williams Press Conference today in which he claims to be the black illegitimate son of Bill Clinton who has been persecuted by Hillary all of these years.
15 | Betty Jean Perez | 6 | 10154752895841336_10154752926646336 | Get Out and Vote!! Make this year one to remember. We need change, we need Donald Trump. We have had eight years of nothing but scandals and corruption, time to clean the swamp. Go Red Go!!!
16 | Dianne Johnson | 2 | 10154752895841336_10154752986671336 | wish they would show the true numbers, not the slanted ones that favor killary, because after the last round of email scandals, you know the ones not coming from wikileaks that the media always seem to ignore,but the one coming from our own FBI, I can probably say with certainty that it was the last straw for many people who were on the fence, not only did killary allow classified emails to be compromised, but she did so with a woman with known links to terrorist, and if it didn't shake those fence sitters up then this country is doomed. how this POS killary is still in the race is mind blowing, WAKE UP PEOPLE....#Trump/Pemce2016
17 | Kait Darcey | 2 | 10154752895841336_10154752953946336 | Just think about it, " A woman is running for President... shes got a bad reputation for corruption, shes disloyal to the military, shes disloyal to her staff, shes disloyal to the people of the USA. Shes a liar, shes sloppy with a laptop, she smiles like the devil, and a long list of people have suspicious deaths, she doesnt like woman, cringes when approached by people and children, shes married to a suspected serial adulterer accused of raping a 13 year old, and she represented a monster who brutally raped a little girl of 12 years old and witheld the evidence. This woman was on tape laughing the guy got off with 1 month punishment. The 12 year old girl was so brutally raped she was hospitalised for months. Now an adult, she will never have children due to the damage internally. This woman running for president is once again under investigation by the FBI, and highly ammused by this serious matter mocking the highly respected FBI. The list is endless and the woman running is Hillary Clinton. And thats just great right ???? If she wins.... USA president under investigation for her first several months in the oval office, somthing to be proud of right ??? Of course not. Its complete madness. Trump will go to the Whitehouse. Or should he ?? He did say "pussy" ?? Hmm. Lol big deal. Compared to the Clintons above and so on... the future is Trump 2016.
18 | Mike LaRosa | 4 | 10154752895841336_10154752958186336 | I still don't believe these polls.  They want us to think that this election is actually a close tight race.  You people are smart, you have been watching very closely and you see right through the media bias and spin.  No matter what get out and vote, the silent majority needs to roar on election day.  God speed people!
19 | Alec Gormley | 2 | 10154752895841336_10154752948656336 | Electing Trump is not a worry even his own party will have him under a micro scope watching policing everything he does, making sure of what he does on both sides making it a government again.
20 | Rick Nance | 5 | 10154752895841336_10154752940166336 | How can any working folks ever consider voting for Hillary? Basically we are tax poor now. Trump has done so many great things with his life. Hillary on the other hand has lied ,cheated , stolen, etc. from the people.
21 | Joyce Boyd | 2 | 10154752895841336_10154752936506336 | I haven't been out in a long time, but when Hillary loses, I am going to go out and buy myself the biggest steak and drink the stiffest drink I can find.  I am going to celebrate my butt off.

25 | Marilyn Aderman Lillard | 4 | 10154752895841336_10154752960726336 | Hilary is teaching our kids that it's ok to cheat at debates by "accepting" the questions beforehand. She teaching our kids that it's okay to send protesters to someone else's rally just to rig his chances.  She is a disgrace to Americans and it embarrasses me as as an American citizen that we would even allow her run for president.

Governor John Kasich wrote in John McCain for president instead of Donald J. Trump, according to his spokesperson.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Vince Edwards | 6130 | 10154752804201336_10154752811016336 | What a loser I hope the citizens of Ohio remember this
2 | Geoffrey Calderaro | 5610 | 10154752804201336_10154752816736336 | So he essentially voted for Hillary Clinton. John Kasich is what is wrong with the Republican Party and the Country. And I hope Republican voters remember him kindly!
3 | Christie McCullough Carter | 2387 | 10154752804201336_10154752815371336 | Congratulations Kasich, you should have just check Hillary, because in reality that is what you just did. I have lost all respect for you!!
4 | Anne Cousino White | 1235 | 10154752804201336_10154752815636336 | Today, an automotive parts plant in Sandusky Ohio announced they will be closing on Dec. 31 and 400 workers are losing their jobs. I don't think they will be writing Kasich in.
5 | Joel M. Mazel | 1328 | 10154752804201336_10154752811616336 | Get out the vote for Trump now until the polls close on Election Day. Let's win by a landslide on Nov. 8. Enough of the corruption, deception, and lies!!
6 | Nikola Locki | 815 | 10154752804201336_10154752809646336 | As a European i can't understand why the Americans are so dumb. Just take a look at Libyia!!! What happend to this country after the American brought them "democracy"... SO vote for Killary dear dumb Americans.
7 | Isaac Anim | 741 | 10154752804201336_10154752809906336 | PRAYER FOR TRUMP AND PENCE.Dear Heavenly Father, please cover Donald Trump, Mike Pence and their respective families and aides with the blood of Jesus. Protect them from snares and attacks of the enemy, for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Send angels to guard them, guide them, and protect them. Fill their day with joy, strength, and your wisdom. Anoint Donald and Mike and all who hear their message with the Holy Spirit so that they may touch everyone with understanding and feel their hearts just like you did in Pentecost. Motivate them to go out and vote. In Jesus Christ we pray. Amen
8 | Omar Villa | 531 | 10154752804201336_10154752820166336 | To the people commenting below about not voting for Trump, you're ridiculous. People need to vote for whoever they want. Trump didn't get to where he is by his political correctness. The fact that he's there shows the people are fed up. Donald J. Trump for President!
9 | Keith Pousson | 396 | 10154752804201336_10154752825066336 | Kasich your a total idiot. I am sick of you and Jeb Bush and all the other traitors in the republican party. You are sealing your own fate with these bad decisions you are making. You will find that out when election day comes and your out fool
10 | Stacey Noles | 366 | 10154752804201336_10154752821286336 | Well that would have been great if this was 2008, but  McCain is not running for president. I find that rediculous that Kasich would throw away his vote, he may as well just endorse Hillary! Writing in John McCain is actually worse than voting for Gary Johnson!
11 | Barb Helle-Morris | 234 | 10154752804201336_10154752817946336 | You are done!!  I live in OHIO...no one is voting for you for dog catcher or garbage man again!!  Hope you move to Canada with the rest of the idiots!!
12 | Lorie Taylor | 140 | 10154752804201336_10154752822871336 | John McCain? John was just in a video on Espan defending Huma Abedin! All these Rhinos under the Clinton spell need to go,!!
13 | Tonja Harville Walksler | 85 | 10154752804201336_1802493010020379 | I am so disappointed in Mr. Kasich. The American people chose Mr. Trump as their candidate and he has basically said he does not care about the voice of the people and turned his back on us.
14 | Ralph Belanger | 41 | 10154752804201336_1802493373353676 | Your on top of my list of Republican Establishment Elites along with Jeb Bush and Paul Ryan that are against the will of the people. You and yours will get your just rewards in the long run for your stupid decision making. You are pond scum !!!
15 | Kelly Ingram Rodgers | 56 | 10154752804201336_1769172506681912 | Idiot. Might as well put Kermit the frog because neither have a chance. üòÇüòÇ The only thing he is doing is ensuring he is never elected again, and basically is taking a vote away from Trump, which in turn supports Clinton.  Way to go "Republican".  üò°üò°
16 | Jamie Bobo | 50 | 10154752804201336_10154752819981336 | He is freaking joke. Why is anyone even giving him ANY coverage. It will be a good thing when he becomes a forgotten footnote in history.
17 | Ted Eldreth | 64 | 10154752804201336_10154752810911336 | Sounds like a sore loser....gonna take his ball and go home I guess....
18 | Julie A. Spears | 37 | 10154752804201336_560912620774045 | What a moron! First of all John McCain couldn't even win when he was running! Secondly, Kasich is acting like a petulant child. Grow up for crying out loud, and stop acting like a sore loser. You just wasted your vote and showed people that you are NOT a leader of any kind. If you wanted to vote for Hillary, why didn't you just grow a pair and say you were voting for her like the Bush's did?
19 | Mike Michel | 34 | 10154752804201336_1769172826681880 | Typical politician...."we all promised to support the nominee, Trump at first refused then relented...but we all eventually signed on"But I lost, so I am taking my ball and going home. Rot in hell loser. You have shown you only care about corrupt establishment.
20 | Shawn Frederick | 25 | 10154752804201336_1802492246687122 | Of course. The established politicians don't want to see him blow up their corrupt way of life. Republican or Democrat, they all make deals, add bs amendments to laws, and ultimately use their power to improve their lives not the lives of the people in this great country.
21 | Dawn Grandchamp | 21 | 10154752804201336_1797836083806550 | Funny thing, at the beginning of the campaign, all of the Republican nominees signed the pledge to vote for whomever the nominee was.  Now that Trump is the nominee, they are all scattering like cockroaches in light.
22 | Susan Foskuhl Baker | 13 | 10154752804201336_560944667437507 | I am in Ohio voter ... I  Voted for John Kasich twice and thought he was a good governor. But when he was not a man of his word during the debates I lost all respect. When he refused to go to the Republican convention in Cleveland I was appalled. I will never vote for this man again. If he has hopes of running for president in 2020-I will actively work against him.
23 | Joe Hambright | 29 | 10154752804201336_10154752819566336 | There once was a candidate named Clinton, Who deserves to retire at San Quentin.For lies and deceit,A beatdown complete,Orange pantsuits look good at the prison.
24 | Kyle Simpson | 19 | 10154752804201336_10154752818626336 | Wasn't he complaining that all of them should support the nominee? Didn't he pledge to? Good thing we didn't vote for this dishonorable.
25 | Gloria Saldivar | 22 | 10154752804201336_1769170923348737 | Kasich just dropped a rung on the food chain. I'm an Arizona Conservative who refuses to vote for McCain again. He no longer represents the people, but his cronies, like Kasich.  Get off our payroll!  #TermLimits

‚ÄúThis is what life with the Clintons looks like. It‚Äôs always a scandal one after another.‚Äù

Speaker Paul Ryan says former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton work the system to help themselves.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Wayne Thomas | 1469 | 10154752644316336_10154752653761336 | Ryan you better get your butt out there & campaign for DJT in WI. Otherwise you will be the one not getting a vote NEXT
2 | Ben Derrick | 1478 | 10154752644316336_10154752659071336 | As a blackman, I fully support Donald Trump for President! Trump looks so professional and Presidential!!! Hillary Clinton to go away when defeated on election day! Hillary Clinton to be put to shame & jailed; never to show her face again! TRUMP 2016!!!!!! I cannot WAIT until you take office!!!!! I wish it was tomorrow. The only Endorsements Trump needs is......We The People!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
3 | Saluda Mountain Jamboree | 305 | 10154752644316336_10154752703501336 | Well where have you been Mr. Ryan. ??   You jumped ship and left everyone in the boat to survive if they could?? And now you want back in our boat to help us??  You are playing the game of the politician--I have lost all respect for you and your game.
4 | Bettye Midkiff Midkiff | 313 | 10154752644316336_10154752668351336 | Paul Ryan is for himself. He's setting the ground work to run for President .His wife is a democratic lobbyist.
5 | Chasity Newton | 227 | 10154752644316336_10154752684316336 | I don't understand why Hillary is able to run for president? It's foolish! Congress and the FBI have sat back and watched this crap happen for years! Now you guys decide to finally wake up, if she wins, we are all screwed!!! Trump for president üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
6 | Jeanette Amen | 212 | 10154752644316336_10154752673996336 | It's amazing to me that Paul Ryan can't even carry his home state of Wisconsin.  Maybe he should get off his butt and campaign up there for the national ticket.  I used to fooled by him - but no more.
7 | Debbie Knight | 139 | 10154752644316336_10154752686531336 | I still haven't changed my thoughts about this turncoat.  Just watched him dance around his talking but couldn't even say the name Trump.  I wouldn't vote for Ryan for dog catcher.
8 | Sandy Len | 150 | 10154752644316336_10154752692231336 | You might not like Trump but he was chosen by the American people so you better get your butt behind him. Any Republican not backing him should lose their job. Just my opinion.
9 | Jeff Harrison | 87 | 10154752644316336_10154752673481336 | After Trump gets elected president, he needs to get this traitor out too. Draining the swamp doesn't just mean libs, plenty of turncoat republicans need to be removed.
10 | Glen Hazelwood | 46 | 10154752644316336_10154752680956336 | Irony...If Hillary Clinton gets elected, then the FBI recommends she be indicted afterwards, the majority of the legal precedent for how to deal with the potential indictment of a sitting president will be based upon Bill Clinton.Let that sink in for a minute. heh...
11 | Michelle Fisher | 24 | 10154752644316336_710439625774673 | They republican establishment should have been standing behind Trump all along! Paul Ryan disgusts me for all the games he has played during this election.
12 | Kathie Mixon | 19 | 10154752644316336_10154752719541336 | Where have you been Mr. Ryan???? It's time for you to get on board and help Trump and get your Republican Party behind you to support Trump. If you think this about the Clinton's then you better get out there and help Trump. Starting in your own state of WI!!!!!!
13 | Susan Kay Richardson | 23 | 10154752644316336_10154752701296336 | Paul Ryan is a turncoat! He deserves nothing! He will get NOTHING from me ever again: no vote, no endorsement, no support! Go ahead Paul, say all you can say because your days in government are OVER!
14 | Kay Driggers | 15 | 10154752644316336_10154752727316336 | This man speaks out of both sides of his mouth...depending which way the wind is blowing! I strongly support Trump, but I trust nothing this man has to say....he's only looking out for Paul Ryan!
15 | Joann Gavin | 26 | 10154752644316336_10154752676896336 | Now you make a statement, your a coward for not supporting the republican nominee. DONALD TRUMP!!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏Don't look the other way in difficult times, if your so wise....
16 | Regina Schuester | 8 | 10154752644316336_588383308024223 | If the woman was unaware of the rules & regulations of how to manage emails as Secretary of State, how can we trust her to have enough smarts to manage the 3 second end of the world nuke button?  Geeze - she might be above the law, but come on - how much dumber can she be by creating this unnecessary mess? Not the brightest light bulb in the messy bunch!  What other stupid messes does she have in her toolbox?
17 | Michael W. McGuire | 5 | 10154752644316336_10154752696696336 | A very tepid response from Pauly! He said as little about Donald Trump as he could possibly get by with. If he hadn't been ask questions point blank about Trump, I wonder if he would have even mentioned him. And he said his positions haven't changed, well I wonder if they haven't changed just a little bit from the day he was booed off stage for bad mouthing Trump when the Dems put out the video against Trump that they and the Republicans thought would finish him off? Pauly wouldn't even have his position if it wasn't for the other Rino Republicans pushing him into it, when they thought a more conservative, posssibly Tea Party type was going to get it! Pauly is "still" not on the Trump train but has just jumped up on the first step and fearing to come on board! Like the song goes, "You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything" Pauly!
18 | Brad Mann | 10 | 10154752644316336_10154752700551336 | say what you want about Paul Ryan, but he IS right. Too bad this wasnt said earlier, but it is truth. Ive watched the Clintons do whatever they wanted for years. They live by a different set of rules and i for one am sick & tired of it
19 | Lisa O'Connor | 8 | 10154752644316336_10154752662311336 | If Trump is elected President what is the GOP going to do in December when his underage rape trial comes up...how disgustingly embarrassing for a president...For a country.
20 | Gail Ann Margaret | 6 | 10154752644316336_710430555775580 | It's about time some of the party stepped up to help him!  All of you "conservatives" scattered because of a few inappropriate things he may have said, and I just thank God for MEN like Julian Assange and Wikileaks, or the republican party would have done a better job than Clinton's campaign manager in getting her elected.
21 | KaRol Gre | 13 | 10154752644316336_10154752707416336 | Paul Ryan is the first one I'd like to see drained from the swamp. Even over Pelosi and that's saying something! But at least she is true to her party. He's a spineless turncoat and a flip-flopping opportunist.
22 | Chad Jackson | 7 | 10154752644316336_10154752725101336 | Paul Ryan using the Dem playbook of accusing someone of something they are doing themselves. We need to "drain the swamp" and that includes Paul Ryan as speaker. He will backstab Trump left and right as speaker. Hope they are already planning for the next Speaker.
23 | Sandra Hubred Chase | 10 | 10154752644316336_710436762441626 | I'm sorry, but Paul Ryan is a piece of two faced üí©!! He should of been backing Trump to begin with... Just by speaking out now, he shows his true colors!! Man cannot be trusted!! My opinion
24 | Patricia Losh | 6 | 10154752644316336_588397964689424 | Did anyone else notice that this man cannot say Trump's name he refers to him as the parties nominee. I could never vote for him for anything so I hope he fades into the woodwork. I am not a Cruz fan but I would vote for him over Ryan anyday, At least he is out front about his feelings while Ryan just plays his little games. Very childish.
25 | Ken Thill | 8 | 10154752644316336_710441019107867 | Paul Ryan,  we have decided that WE DO NOT NEED YOU!!!  Nice try though and hopefully you didn't destroy Ron's chances at re-election.

Just hours before the tomb was re-sealed Friday, the original limestone burial bed was found to be intact.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Christina Bishop | 1604 | 10154750212551336_10154752580336336 | Our nation better turn back to God and fast!
2 | Josue Guevara | 1176 | 10154750212551336_10154752581271336 | this is not christ tomb everyone who follow him knows this, only religious people think christ was buried in here! god is not about shrines & worshipping idols, he is about the renewal of your heart and committment to righteousness!' The lord atone's for our sins, there is no need for shrines or idols.......
3 | Jeremy Barnes | 727 | 10154750212551336_10154752585371336 | Praise to the Risen King! He is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords! He is the First and the Last, the Beginning and The End, the Son Of the One and only Mighty God, the Great I Am. The Way, the Truth and the Light, and no one comes to the Father except through Him!
4 | Tyler Sorrels | 546 | 10154750212551336_10154752587066336 | I bet they "found" this just because the FBI found 650,000 more emails.
5 | Dougal Springer | 600 | 10154750212551336_10154752581951336 | Christ is not there. He raised Himself from the dead 3 days later.
6 | Colleen Miller | 259 | 10154750212551336_10154752604431336 | Here's a question. Why must we disturb any sacred place? What if some nuts wanted to dig up your grandma? Laid to rest until archeologists determine it's necessary to disturb you to further their theories.
7 | Daniel Tallmadge | 191 | 10154750212551336_10154752606751336 | I was trying to see if they reported a body as part of propaganda and I'm surprised they didn't try. You know, Jesus rose 3 days later so of course he isn't there! Even more and further proof of Jesus's miracle!
8 | Kimberly Campbell Parker | 77 | 10154750212551336_10154752610571336 | Oh, my gosh.Jesus, son of Mary.The Christ. Son of the living God was interred in a borrowed tomb following the crucifixion. The tomb in question is not said to contain human remains, it's is simply the accepted location of where the miracle of his resurrection occurred.READ, people.
9 | Kristen E Stieger | 81 | 10154750212551336_10154752594351336 | If this is in fact a place where Jesus was laid to rest after he died then that is amazing that they were able to find it however no matter if you are a Christian Jew or atheist if you follow God you know for a fact that Jesus was resurrected from the dead and came back to life and he never died again. With this being said, we all know that his body would not be in this tune and if any person was to say that they found a body in that to you with the no especially for a fact that this is not Jesus's tomb. However no matter what anyone says in these comments or in the world you will never know 100% if this was in fact his resting place but that doesn't mean that people need to be negative and say no this isn't his resting place because that's not for you to say! God bless.Ôøº
10 | Lori Coggin Sands | 56 | 10154750212551336_1795370120719707 | I believe Jesus was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, died on the cross as a sacrificial lamb in MY place. He rose again 3 days later and will return for those who believe. I don't know why he loved me so much. I don't know why my name is written in the palm of God's hand, but I proudly identify with him and share his love. Jesus is not in the tomb! Thank God, he's not there!
11 | Ronnie Watkins | 33 | 10154750212551336_10154752707746336 | I can tell you what they didn't find and will never find...Christ's ashes, bones or anything else of His remains...Because He is Risen!! Now Muhammad, yeah he has been dead for a long time now...and he is still dead.
12 | Eliza Ann McNair | 28 | 10154750212551336_10154752693491336 | You better be concerned about what Jesus about to do in the near future.  He gave us signs to look for that we are in the last days, the conclusion of Satan the Devil wicked world. Read Matthew 24 : 3-14 and Luke 21 : 7-19 and Mark 13:3-10. Also, read 2 Timothy 3:1-5,13. Since the "last days " Jesus been riding as Revelation 6:2, and 3-8 three other horses been following behind him. Read the prophecies. Jesus ride is almost over,  read Revelation 19:11-16 and Revelation 17:12-14 and Revelation 19:19-21. Where Jesus was buried is not significant for our day. But, what he's about to execute in the near future is!!! Read your scriptures. And Deuteronomy 30: 19 is still true today.
13 | Mike Kelley | 18 | 10154750212551336_10154752609691336 | So what they are saying is he died on a cross so the people that tortured and killed him were nice enought to carve a cross on a tomb he wasnt in? They found a tomb with a cross on it , but its not Jesus Crist
14 | Matthew Wright | 23 | 10154750212551336_10154752601256336 | The rock or cave, is no more holy than the rest of the planet God created. It was He, that rose from the dead, laying inside that tomb, that was and is, holy. To revere a tomb is against what God taught us, for we are to revere but one, and that is the risen Christ, the lamb of God!
15 | Brandi Peterson | 22 | 10154750212551336_10154752618141336 | We have no record of where Jesus was buried, except that the tomb originally belonged to Joseph of Arimathea. So let's hypothetically say for the sake of argument this is for sure the place where Jesus was buried. Really he only borrowed it for a few days and was gone. Who is to say that Joseph and his family weren't buried there afterward? Or what about Jesus's earthly family? There was Mary and and several brothers and sisters. Just because the tomb isn't empty now doesn't mean it wasn't emptied then.
16 | Robert Baggett | 32 | 10154750212551336_10154752611701336 | This place is all wrong. I was in Israel in 1999. I saw the REAL tomb, and its right around the corner from a hill, Golgotha's Hill - the place of the skull - like the Bible says. Not this place.
17 | Saray Paniagua | 13 | 10154750212551336_10154752647296336 | The tomb is empty!!! The important is not the tomb,the important in this story is that Jesus is alive and wants to have a relationship with you and me!!

19 | Michelle Henthorne | 5 | 10154750212551336_1795383250718394 | First and most "God is Great" not only did he die so we could have eternal life, He is loving and kind. Christianity is love, forgiveness and kindness. The Bible is our guide to him. Believe how you choose but it's a free gift, why wouldn't you seek it. For those non believers, spend time with someone who's dieing, watch them, Talk to them, you might start feeling/believing that there is a higher power and he is God.
20 | Ben Young | 18 | 10154750212551336_10154752658821336 | I highly doubt it. Jesus was buried in a privately owned tomb outside of the city, not smack dab in the middle of Jerusalem‚Äôs Church of the Holy Sepulchre...
21 | Teni Yarborough Tillery | 18 | 10154750212551336_10154752627941336 | But wait!! You left out the best part!!  No body or bones!! Christ isn't dead! He's risen and alive!!!!
22 | Felicia Clark-Peaseley | 6 | 10154750212551336_10154752691011336 | The tomb was empty! Christ rose from the dead!

She is pushing a Muslim agenda, and no, God and Allah are not the same entity!
23 | Dan Sweborg | 3 | 10154750212551336_10154752635621336 | Article doesn't even specify what if anything was recently found. Interesting it mentioned the "fatimid caliphate" that destroyed the church a thousand years ago.  At least it's a "peaceful religion"
24 | Anna King | 3 | 10154750212551336_1795371937386192 | That's actually inaccurate, whether you're a Christian or not. "Christian tradition" says that Jesus was buried in a tomb that had been prepared for a wealthy man who agreed to have Jesus laid there instead. Nowhere is it said in the Bible that any kind of tomb was made /after/ Christ's death.

Breaking News: Iraq's special forces enter the outskirts of Mosul more than 2 weeks after the operation to retake the ISIS hub began, Maj. Gen. Sami al-Aridi confirms.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | HL Dye | 47 | 10154752543641336_10154752606886336 | maybe Obama and his group of ignorant people can notifiy the enemy when the troops are going in again. Plum Sick, Obama & Hillary Clinton are total jerks.
2 | Clarence Eddy | 46 | 10154752543641336_10154752544946336 | Obama has recently come under fire for saying that ISIS (or ISIL) had been ‚Äúcontained‚Äù ONLY ONE DAY before terrorists launched a massive, coordinated attack in France. "We have contained them," Obama told ABC News and then he further remarked: ‚ÄúI don't think they're gaining strength.‚Äù‚ÄîObama would never want to betray his beloved Muslim brethren. Just look at how he sat on his hands while ISIS took over the Middle East and while Boko Harum took over Africa. He has destroyed our foreign policy. Stateside, Obama is no better. He has crippled our economy. Everybody I know is either out of work or under-employed. And our expenses keep rising. My health insurance is now up to $456/month. Before the government touched it, it was just $190/month! My auto insurance, which the government has yet to ruin, is thankfully only $25/month (from Insurance Panda). Please, Obama! Do not try to socialize ANYTHING ELSE!Just another example of Obama being completely out-of-touch with reality and his feckless and shortsighted military leadership, showing his inability or unwillingness to muster the necessary military resources and international cooperation needed in order to degrade and finally destroy this formidable and growing threat to our collective way of life!!

9 | Terrell Lee | 4 | 10154752543641336_10154752615111336 | Mr. Trump, I applaud and wish you all the best in your efforts to help the country that you obviously love.  It seems Public Service these days is a very difficult, thankless position with a negative view from the the court of public opinion. This is exactly what has come from years of the elites consortium running our government as their own monarchy, they claim themselves American Royalty.  The American people are angry and most likely depressed, it doesn't help when we are ungraciously talked down to and called derogatory names from a Presidential Candidate.  It's just how powerful we've let them become, the anxiety comes from knowing that we're ruled and most likely many wouldn't even flinch if Hillary took out a whip and ordered Capitol Punishment upon her subjects. We're a Beatdown Nation. Maybe I'm a bit na√Øve,  my beliefs are to assist my fellow human beings and I want for everyone exactly what I want for myself, Health, Happiness and Prosperity.   It's come to the point where these God-given rites come at a price, again I applaud your willingness to Serve and preserve our empowerment, our wellbeing and our freedoms. #AmericaFirst#DrainTheSwamp
10 | Danae Delaney | 0 | 10154752543641336_10154752902311336 | Oh yes, of course. Like Trump said, I said it at home before I heard it, right before the election. I'm sorry, starting war offensives for political gain, the Democrats need to be OUT of the Oval Office! That is NOT making good decisions. That is making decisions for political gain.

That is the only reason they have pushed for them to go into the city so fast and kept it in the news. It's part of a strategy to make the president look good to get people to vote democrat
19 | Terrence Lucus | 8 | 10154752543641336_10154752546816336 | So it has taken 1 and half weeks to basically run them cockroaches out of Mosul...why wasn t this done 18 months ago...Nice work Barry and Hillary

3 | Nick Nicholas | 35 | 10154752506901336_10154752539546336 | Matt Duran. If I may ask? What does that have to do with bus accident? Secondly what you write is not accurate. Potentially? Lol. My question is do get paid hourly or daily by the Clinton Machine to do this? You are a disgusting, sorry excuse for a human being.
4 | Ashley Folgmann | 15 | 10154752506901336_10154752737571336 | Can we please require seat belts on every school bus for every child??!! So many laws for car seats in your own car but once they get on a huge bus they don't even have to wear a seat belt?
5 | Teresa Mikeal | 17 | 10154752506901336_10154752582966336 | I drove a bus for 17 yrs. it's a huge responsibility. I hear about bus wrecks almost everyday somewhere. Praying for the bus drivers and especially for the precious children.
6 | Beverley Rexrode Hall | 2 | 10154752506901336_10154752569761336 | Why couldn't it be those a**holes on the bus who are worried about politicsinstead of innocent people on their way to school and work who didn't care about politics. Shame on all of you who have no compassion. You will have to answer to your maker one day you heartless souls.
7 | Tim Byrnes Sr. | 14 | 10154752506901336_10154752553071336 | I would think if kids were on that bus, the rear emergency door would have been opened for evacuation assistance. Let's hope that is th case and all prayers are with all those involved.
8 | Rhia Logan | 8 | 10154752506901336_10154752691186336 | I've read on another news site that there were no kids on the bus. There are six confirmed dead so far.  Prayers for all involved and families of those that have passed away.

17 | Tammy Heslin | 1 | 10154752506901336_10154752579586336 | This should never happen! Where r all the seat belts on buses? I don't understand why there r no seat belts on buses or some other way to protect our children on the road!!!
18 | Oscar Orlando | 1 | 10154752506901336_10154752614831336 | Maybe we should take a look at having a computer monitoring speed and road conditions in busses. Something simple that can survive the crash and at least tell us if any of these drivers was speeding. Better yet- put an alcohol blow thing to avoid having a drunk driver on these buses.
19 | Stacey Waterson | 2 | 10154752506901336_10154752739251336 | Omg! I saw the tragic headline and of course my first thought was to pray for the children and deceased/injured.... then my second was some as--ole was going to put a political spin on it!How sad it was true!

Donald J. Trump will win the presidential election, according to a poll that tracks and compares the sales of presidential candidate Halloween masks.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Derek McKay | 969 | 10154750500656336_10154752324646336 | I'm not so sure about how much a Halloween mask can predict an election... But Hillary Clinton's criminal investigation and criminal activity can...How she's still even currently running is a mystery to me. Unprecedented!!!
2 | Angie Whitt Hill | 746 | 10154750500656336_10154752326531336 | The few Hillary mask that were bought were people dressed up in prison gear wearing her mask üòÇTrue story! Lol
3 | Mitch Sirota | 371 | 10154750500656336_10154752326026336 | Donald trump will win because the American people are finally waking up in 2016
4 | Golden Hartmann | 285 | 10154750500656336_10154752324816336 | I don't know but if that hag wins it will be Halloween every day.
5 | Alfreta Neill Barrett | 149 | 10154750500656336_10154752336976336 | The mystery is how can anyone vote for Hillary. Pray for America to return to God. Vote Trump/Pence 2016 to restore. America after 8 years of Obama's destruction.
6 | Stuart Rogan | 128 | 10154750500656336_10154752335466336 | Of course DJT gonna win it's been predicted by several smart computers plus it's written in scripture and as well its the will of the people good luck America #votetrumppence from a deplorable supporter from Scotland UK
7 | Levi Crago | 102 | 10154750500656336_10154752339196336 | Odd that every single prediction that has been correct for many elections keeps coming up as trump. Honestly if Hillary wins we riot. Oh wait...nevermind we aren't liberals, we can't riot.
8 | Sarah Morrissey Rutledge | 62 | 10154750500656336_10154752348841336 | Well i mean. People are buying Hillary masks to wear with a prison suit, sooo, though I'm absolutely voting for Trump, this really has no validity to it lol. #Trump2016
9 | Matt James | 33 | 10154750500656336_10154752341741336 | side to the polls, all actual polls by day to day people show that trump wins by a huge landslide, im not saying this bc i back trump but ive spoken and went door to door around my community. not only do average citizens think hes a much better choice but they also think they can trust him to move us forward. I know most of fox is republican and even though im an independent and most of americans are (most citizens vote on partisan politics) he has the best plan forward.
10 | Matt James | 22 | 10154750500656336_10154752331211336 | wierd accurate fact, but possible. hes going to win the popular vote by huge margins but it breaks back into almost the primary, will the delegates, same as the electoral college, back trump. They have the same exact referendum as the primary delegates. Well see i guess =//////
11 | Karen McDowell | 11 | 10154750500656336_10154752349456336 | I think he's going to win but don't think mask sales are a good indicator. Trump has thousands Show up to his rallies compared to the few hundred at best at Hillary's rallies. Trump has enthusiastic supporters whereas Hillary's are supporting her just because she happens to be the democratic nominee. Think Bernie would have had a chance to beat Trump, Hillary has too much baggage weighing her down. I know several folks who were Bernie supporters who now are supporting Trump.
12 | Kimberley Snooks Thomas | 18 | 10154750500656336_10154752324661336 | Couldn't find one for my sons outfit this year. But there sure was a lot of Hillary,Obama and Biden but my son didn't want to be any of them
13 | Paul Anthony Roberts | 9 | 10154750500656336_10154752534691336 | I had a costume all ready to go - Hillary witch mask with green hair, striped prison pantsuit, an empty Clorox bottle hung around my arm (bleach bit), a bag of shredded paper (emails), with a sign around my neck stating "if you pay, I will play" and I would hand out cocktail "wieners" as an appetizer at the party.  Needless to say, my wife overruled me on it...she is non-controversial, but I loved it.  Lol
14 | Manuel Veyna III | 27 | 10154750500656336_10154752327291336 | What CNN & Donna Brazile were ousted doing would've never been held accountable if it weren't for Wikileaks. In business we call this "insider trading" a federal offense punishable by jail time. Brazile & CNN both should be charged for leaking questions to one presidential candidate over another which puts proof to Trumps claim that the system is RIGGED.CNN should face a congressional investigation!
15 | Delaney Trucker Miller | 4 | 10154750500656336_10154752478221336 | Something to think about before voting Hillary's open borders will let Isis and other terrorist come and go as they please putting us all in danger Hillary supports Obamacare going up 50 to 100% the FBI would not have reopened the investigation 11 days before an election on Hillary if they didn't have a significant find has the voters forgot about Benghazi and the four Americans that died there auras are voters ruthless like Hillary and think what difference does it make now and for people that don't work because they're disabled or lazy Obama has outspent every president before him it'll be the same with Hillary we have a pool where benefits come fromWhen the pool goes dry we're all screwed at least Trump lower and taxes will create millions of jobs the revenue can refill the pool think about that when you vote Trump for a better stronger and safer America
16 | Rhonda Knutson | 2 | 10154750500656336_10154752640511336 | It definitely had the opposite affect here in Canada where I live... the kids wearing Trump attire was something to be made fun of. Many kids speaking of the ridiculous things he has come out with. One kid In a trump costume says... "I need to build a wall along the border", then laughed. To which his friend replied. "Yeah, to keep you and your nutty followers out of our country. You'll be doing Canada a favour, so thanks!" Everyone laughed... I said to the kid as I gave him candy, that he doesn't look like he's very well liked in these parts. He laughed and said he hates the guy too, but is loving the comments that are coming out of everyone's mouths when they see him. Apparently at another house this kid went too, one man told him to go back to the US where he belongs...but the guy said PLEASE first, which is totally Canadian! lol Another kid comes up dressed as Trump and as soon as he gets to me, I groaned and said.. " Oh no... not you, Trump!" He laughed and said he thinks he chose the wrong costume this year, as people are giving him less candy and he went on to tell me that the reactions that he was getting from people handing out candy would definitely be a sign that he wouldn't win an election here! üòÇ He's a smart teen I would say. A friend of mine went to the bar dressed up as him as well, he brought his girlfriend who was dressed up as a kitty cat. Trump was constantly grabbing his cat! *If you know what I mean* So yet another example of people making fun of the guy and not because they like him, but rather they dislike him.lol So if this poll you are taking, includes the sales of masks here in Canada too, ours might not be so supporting of the guy. lol My personal opinion on this election is that they are both walking disasters... There will be no real win for the US this time around, but it sure is fun to watch from the sidelines. üòÇ
17 | Mary M Odum | 4 | 10154750500656336_10154752554056336 | Her way the criminals will have guns and the rest of us won't... She will destroy America with her so called promises... open boarders etc she only cares about herself LOCK HER UP !!! CROOKED LIAR CLINTON'S!!! VOTE TRUMP/PENCE !!!
18 | Milton Hillgartner | 3 | 10154750500656336_10154752412671336 | With election day so close couldn't you find better use of your FB page than waste it on stupid stuff like this? Intelligent people turn to FOX for the truth since it's been proven that all other media sources are as corrupt as the current administration! It appears that you are trying to lean towards becoming as bad as the rest which are at the same level as the National Enquirer supermarket tabloid! I guess i just don't find anything funny about an election that may determine the downfall of our country and the loss of the Constitution!
19 | Josh Young | 2 | 10154750500656336_10154752500691336 | Lol Fox is scraping the bottom of the barrel to try and make Trump look like he's going to win. Can't even dress up for Halloween anymore without trying to make it about politics.
20 | Molly Yanich | 5 | 10154750500656336_10154752351646336 | I read somewhere that a lot of Obama masks were sold in 2008 and he went on to win the election (unfortunately) but predicting based on Halloween could be accurate lol
21 | Mike Hammer | 2 | 10154750500656336_10154752724646336 | Rarely do we see a Trump mask used to mock him, but just about every hitlery mask I've seen is either behind bars, or in cuffs....or a jumpsuit signifying both.
22 | Jesse Ward | 1 | 10154750500656336_1426952460665981 | Of course Trump will win the election. You mainstream media think that Hillary will win but we the people decide who will be president. If you don't like the results, then you can cry all you want. Even if all these polls have "tightened", they are still over sampled.
23 | Cindy Nichols Bailey | 0 | 10154750500656336_10154752525451336 | With the news now of Soros' voting machines program that can change the voting "numbers" once the are calculator and forwarded to the election officials, the numbers can be altered within seconds to the way they want it to be.  So even if Hillary actually loses by the numbers, she'll still win by fraud if this cannot be changed Election Day.  See InfoWar FB account.

HYPOCRISY at its best! How about educating our children to think on their own, to express their own opinions and belief even if the liberal professors have an aneurysm

3 | Mike Lewellen | 196 | 10154750351821336_10154752266726336 | It's all good until they realize they've used their fear of hurt feelings to regulate away their right to free speech and ability to present a dissenting argument against whatever ultra leftist crap is popular at the moment.
4 | James Hubbert | 129 | 10154750351821336_10154752281201336 | That moment when the liberals eat their own not realizing they were once called the "rebels" of society, only to be taken over by the socital snowflakes.

Forget trying to set your opinions against educated peers, having your ideas challenged while learning of different points of view. If you don't agree with every last garbage liberal concept  regurgitated by your pompous, pathetic excuse of a teacher expect to be singled out, embarrassed, or shunned. Take that mindset right back to grade school along with the safe spaces and the other trash happening now in universities nation wide.
7 | Gloria Simons Richards | 78 | 10154750351821336_10154752278046336 | Colleges certainly aren't what they use to be. A person would go to a place of higher education to expand their minds. Now, all they can hope for is a safe space and degree in minimal mental activity. With this and all the rest of the nutty things I have read, who with any intelligence would really want to attend these places at any price?
8 | Sonia Dotson | 38 | 10154750351821336_10154752299521336 | So the once universally inclusive safe academic space for free thought and exercise has been 'sensored silent' at a University ( look up the meaning )...he is correct the lunatics are running the asylum. Free thought welcome so long as you agree with 'us', belovedly your PC Policia. Idocrity at it full display and glory. Where every fool is given and rightly earned a certificate of authenticity like every one else.[ think it through]. ü§îüòëüòèüò£üò•
9 | Richard Burtt | 35 | 10154750351821336_10154752318806336 | It is not surprising, nor is it shocking, but it is still saddening that liberals are so easily blinded to the double standards they employ. Ask a liberal if they believe in Free Speech and you get an impassioned "YES!" Ask that same liberal about, for instance, Mr. Trump wanting to build a wall to prevent illegal immigration and you get a diatribe about how evil, racist, bigoted, islamophobic, homophobic, and anti-women he is. All manner of outrage. But what  about when Ms. Clinton, for example, says that half of Mr. Trump's supporters would fit in a basket of deplorables? Silence. Or her "joke" about being "allergic to Trump" when she had a coughing attack? Silence. An even better example is the young gay couple that publicly endorsed Mr. Trump and were the recipients of threats and taunts. THAT is the liberal version of free speech.
10 | Jean Paul Thibodaux | 10 | 10154750351821336_10154752588061336 | Wait.. so because he doesn't agree with liberals and possibly influences critical thinking to these students.... they boot him. Sounds like Communism to me. What these people need to understand is that a Utopian society is an impossible feat. It cannot and will not happen, ever! Read George Orwells "1984".. you might learn something.
11 | Richard A Berrieault | 17 | 10154750351821336_10154752307856336 | It's not an education, it's indoctrination, and that's what Hillary's "free" college tuition will get. Don't think for a second they'll be giving away Dr. or Lawyer degrees.
12 | Lois Snyder | 7 | 10154750351821336_10154752726661336 | College used to be where you debated about differences not persecuted those who didn't agree with the majority. Civilization is in jeopardy when you can no longer discuss things and agree to disagree. How can you function if you never learn to persuade and compromise?
13 | Jay Ostrem | 13 | 10154750351821336_10154752322276336 | Totally wrong. Our children are being educated in a socialist vacuum.  Parents are paying for it. I graduated with a BS in '82. I noticed right away that if you "screwed up" you got perks. Student who had a child, forced to marry, got preferential housing. Uber young married students got Pell Grants. My parents weren't college grads, I didn't understand scholarships, and my parents weren't poor enough to get a free ride.  I had to borrow, and paid it all.  I appreciated my education and it had value.  The professors were liberal as hell, living in their subsidized socialist subculture. We have to fix this.
14 | Erin Stalcup Lee | 8 | 10154750351821336_10154752329691336 | Why can't these college students across the nation see that they are being brainwashed against the first amendment with the PC culture and "safe spaces?" Eliminating the first (and second) amendents push America toward globalism.
15 | Arv Bergstedt | 16 | 10154750351821336_10154752296636336 | Proves again liberals say we need to be tolerant of abortion, gay rights, restrictions on religion, restrictions on guns, environmental restrictions, etc.  Yet they have NO tolerance for any of our ideas. Schools are great examples. Don't play their P C game plan. Out you go. Kids must be brainwashed to their way of thinking period.
16 | Randy Teem | 4 | 10154750351821336_10154752429491336 | See who the intolerant racist bigots are ??? But mind numbing stupid Liberal Socialist Democrats can't think for themselves or stand up for truth ! They like dumb little goats will follow there leader like they are told ! Michael is practicing His right of free speech and haters are going to hate !! Michael is a great American !
17 | Rose Marie Leo | 3 | 10154750351821336_10154752307816336 | I work in this type of environment where you have to watch every word that comes out of your mouth! If you say the sky is blue and someone doesn't like HOW you say it,you're reprimanded! It's a horrible way to work! This crap is causing people to lose their jobs and has hurt the entire country!
18 | Lue Forte | 5 | 10154750351821336_10154752290721336 | PC is not political correctness but Protective custody. They are diluting down our laws to protect the fortunes of a few, even outsiders. We are living in post world of socialism which tends to fall in the realm of Communism. They judge us individually but collectively to cut out the poor, middle class, and eventually the STATE. They start with speech and then our Laws and Times, and then they sown among our money evil tidings and corrupt everything that is of LIBERTY. They despise you because you know the truth which is presented by the Law, and they being physicians of the Law usurp it's authority and Deny the People basic rights.
19 | Genie Griffieth | 3 | 10154750351821336_10154752319411336 | Of course you would want to get rid of anyone that spoke the truth. It's very painful to face reality. You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Professor I pray that things get better for you. We live in an evil time but know that God said it would be this way. They say evil is good and good is evil. There is a way that seems right to a man but the path leads to destruction.
20 | Leonard Wong Chin San | 1 | 10154750351821336_10154752406736336 | Is it possible that terrorist elements have infiltrated the education sector? Many terrorists are trained to pose as teachers to spread their ideology amongst impressionable students . That said..... it is always good to have common fixed learning objectives for all states, so no one has an excuse to incorporate terrorist propaganda into lessons. However, give each state the freedom to use whatever teaching methodology to expand and build upon it.
21 | Rusty Ralph | 0 | 10154750351821336_10154752491321336 | The sane world is horrified by the Fox News/Alt Right attack on 'political correctness'. "Do unto others as you would wish them to do unto you" is the backbone of the philosophy. Kind words. Civil behavior. Respect. Are now under attack. Shameful.
22 | Ben Curnell | 1 | 10154750351821336_10154752837451336 | I'm so sick of people generalizing all liberals like this because of extreme SJWs. We're not all like that... are all republicans extreme creationist homophobes? No. So why you guys gotta group us all into the worst category?
23 | Ricky Bahena Valencia | 3 | 10154750351821336_10154752638931336 | Sounds like a professor i wish to have, calling out the bullschei√üe of safe spaces and social justice warriors. But alas, they are needles in the haystack, a wolf in sheep's clothing.
24 | Craig S Holt | 5 | 10154750351821336_10154752253986336 | Though he had to know this was going to happen, this would be an opportunity for him to become a professor at at university more suited to his beliefs.
25 | Sue Caton | 1 | 10154750351821336_10154752517276336 | I thought your college years were supposed to be a time when you were to explore new ideas and challenge the status quo so you could learn to make intelligent, informed decisions???

There are many republicans who are neck deep in corruption with her & want her in the WH. It's no longer about parties but good vs evil. The corrupt establishment vs the people. Anybody who doesn't get it by now is part of the problem just trying to confuse the people...
2 | Judy Jack-Burton | 402 | 10154751451281336_10154752154076336 | I don't consider myself either a republican or a democrat.More of a mix.Because, when it comes to views on the ' issues ' separately, I have some that fall on either.However, in this election, I am voting for the 'person' regardless of party.I've been following this election very closely.  More so than any other election.  Because it is that important to me.Been researching and reading everything I can get my hands on.Trying to 'connect all the dots'.I feel 100% sure in my decision.Trump/Pence in 2016!Hillary is the worst thing that could happen to this country.Her corruption and ties are so deeply imbeded.  Combine that with her crimes that are obvious to the public, most people anyway ..And the result would be beyond scary.Time for a change!Time to clean house!!
3 | Patrick Little | 86 | 10154751451281336_10154752148801336 | The way I see it. It's good vs evil. The Republicans are just as progressive as the Democrats. Its time for new blood. Trump is the true Libertarian. If you mean get behind him. Then I am definitely with you. We need to get rid of Republicans like Paul Ryan.

5 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 81 | 10154751451281336_10154752112151336 | Let us hope that Huma has upended the opening of the Horror Show of the millennium -- starring Hillary "Hugo Chavez" Clinton staggering around the Oval Office refreshing her late morning martini; with a supporting cast of William Jefferson Clinton playing "Bill the Sexual Predator", cigar in hand prowling the White House halls in search of a teenage intern (based on a true story), and a cameo with Chelsea wandering around her $6,000,000 Manhattan penthouse asking herself who her real father is. The Sopranos without the class or the charm.Weiner and Lady Weiner, perusing the long list of Clinton helpers cast into flames, no doubt are reviewing witness protection programs.
6 | Tammy Benson | 60 | 10154751451281336_10154752136541336 | Let's compare: Trump NEVER committed treason..Clinton did! Trump NEVER through negligence or incompetence help murder 4 Americans...Clinton did ! Trump NEVER covered his treasonous crimes up...Clinton did! Trump NEVER sold to foreign governments  access to our state dept...Clinton did. Trump NEVER rigged debates...Clinton did. Trump NEVER firebombed election headquarters, attacked supporters and destroyed property...Clinton's people did! Trump NEVER lied to congress over and over and over agian...But Clinton sure did. So celebrities run to Canada, good riddance! This corrupt government is seeing what happens when folks finally say ENOUGH!!!
7 | Derek Wilson | 32 | 10154751451281336_10154752180716336 | Why are people just now creating an uproar about this? Does the "re" in reopening not register to people? This doesn't make sense to me. Why was round one not a big deal. Nothing has really been revealed yet about this reopening and people are acting like a nuke just went off. Was the first mudslide not good enough? Do people not realize that there is once again 2 FBI investigations against her? Did they forget about the first one? Minus this email thing, there is STILL a FBI investigation against her!
8 | Larry Pennington | 26 | 10154751451281336_10154752187091336 | If Hillary is elected you have Paul Ryan and the rest of the turncoat Republicans to thank for a liberal supreme Court for many decades to come. If we can pull this out in spite of those scumbags I wonder if the Republican party will have sense enough to get rid of them.     My wife and I and all of our family members just changed our affiliations to       independant incase Paul Ryan runs in 2020.

10 | Karen Givens | 23 | 10154751451281336_10154752394301336 | The Republicans never should have acted like they have with Trump and disrespecting the American voter's choice for nominee.  I am waiting for the Democrats to ask Hillary to step down!!! They are the ones who should be turning away from their candidate because she does not represent who they are...so wait a minute...I guess that is who they are...corrupt!!! And corrupt just like many Republicans as well.   But Trey Gowdy--he rocks!

12 | Eric Elledge | 6 | 10154751451281336_10154752132706336 | I blame the early primary and caucus states for giving the Republican party three of the most awful nominees in McCain, Romney, and now the worst yet in Trump. The Republican party went for nominees that would basically "preach to the choir", get the male voting demographic, and not much else.  They have had a lot of ignorant Republicans in the early voting states who passed on Ron & Rand Paul, who both appealed to the youth, minorities, and women demographics.  Because of picking horrible nominees, the Democrats EASILY picked up those voting blocks, and had the worst people you could find in Obama and Clinton being able to win the presidency.  To be at this point, and still cry for institutionalized pragmatism, 3 elections in a row, shows the complete ignorance and lack of principles from the Republican party.  The GOP deserves its demise.
13 | Billy Harrison | 9 | 10154751451281336_10154752613516336 | Where's #GeorgeBush and #MittRomney?? I supported both of these men. I'm done with career politicians period. I'll take a smart businessmen or retired Military vet any day!!!
14 | Barbara Tuthill | 3 | 10154751451281336_10154752740496336 | It is a compelling article and will likely fall on deaf ears in many cases.  Trump talks about the corruption in Washington and it isn't only the Democratic party that is corrupt.  Me, personally, I don't vote party lines, but Trump has my vote after many months of research and following both candidates.
15 | Jo Scaife Bearden | 4 | 10154751451281336_10154752402366336 | It will difficult to pull off a Trump win. Even the electoral count is wacked! It used to be fair but with the large populations in big cities it now favors dems. It is like the rural vote does not even matter. So unless people outside the cities get out in strong numbers, it will be a tough win. It needs to be popular vote. They even had a special two days ago on how they can change the demographic lines for the district. That is what the Dems are working on now, to gain back control for next election round. Side note, republicans have done this also. I can see the reasoning because it redistribute the electoral count but can be used just to ensure a certain party wins vs to change to make it balanced and fair. Complicated. Popular vote!
16 | George Medders | 6 | 10154751451281336_10154752626056336 | Can't believe that CNN reporter Donna Brazil gave Hillary debate questions before the debate. Hillary gladly received them knowing it was illegal and she did not tell anyone. CNN has now let Brazil go. Hillary is evil and corrupt. This alone should be enough to disqualify her from the presidency. Cheating on a presidential election.
17 | Jessa Grace | 2 | 10154751451281336_10154752476486336 | Tell that to those holier than thou rinos who felt the need to make public statements about who they were/weren't voting for in order to save their own skins. GOP office holders are responsible for Trump and now they can join up with the rest of us and deal with it. This announcement should have come from the RNC chair and Speaker Ryan. Lack of Republican leadership is stunning.
18 | Marlene Soto-Romero | 0 | 10154751451281336_10154752919086336 | Whatever discord Republicans have had in the last year pales in comparison to the corruption and scandal and outright disgust oozing out of the Democrats.

How boring it would be to listen to some geriatric Che Guevara complain about the "fat cats?" That's all the Democrats can do to bring energy to their rallies--evoke the name Trump. Nothing but negative energy fueling their so-called movement of unhappy angry people. Like all socialist, they build nothing, and merely attack those more successful who they hate out of grinding envy. It's always about promising some future utopia that never arrives. #MAGA TRUMP for POTUS

On her Instagram, she shared a snap of her Cesarean section scar, as well as the caption: "They struggled to rip Jeremiah from my tummy as my abs locked him in super tight as I began vomiting during the operation."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jake Johnson | 1113 | 10154750520701336_10154752008841336 | Meanwhile Hillary belongs in prison and Trump belongs in the White House.
2 | Robin Block | 966 | 10154750520701336_10154752017626336 | Oh the joys of an over exaggerating person. I never experienced a c section that the baby easily slipped out. There was ripping and pushing and I felt like vomiting. It had nothing to do with Rock hard abs. This story cracks me up.
3 | Tim McKnight | 534 | 10154750520701336_10154752030541336 | Im so happy her ego didnt suffer any. She can still show her body to everyone on instigram. The world is so much better she has been spared.
4 | Hailey Carrolan McCorkle | 476 | 10154750520701336_10154752011216336 | Women are meant to have that little bit of a pudge on their tummy. It's scientifically proven to help carry and give birth... the perfect image for women needs to go back to what's healthy for them and their personal body type!
5 | Ben Reed | 381 | 10154750520701336_10154752046211336 | Who cares, as long as the mom looked good, right? After all, it's only a baby. I hope she was able to find a daycare and get back into the gym quickly.
6 | Jeff Pries | 274 | 10154750520701336_10154752054446336 | So, it happens to many different types of women during c-sections. My wife doesn't have her abs but they still needed to practically body slam her to get my son out, and many women vomit during it as well. Nothing new and nothing special just because she is fit.
7 | Danny Blake | 257 | 10154750520701336_10154752096906336 | Welcome to the day and age of chicks looking like dudes flexing in gym mirrors  and dudes dressing like chicks in skinny jeans whining about safe zones. It's a role reversal generation.
8 | Martha Van Metre | 141 | 10154750520701336_10154752061221336 | Omg, you can see the incision below her "rock hard abs" .  What a idiot.  Does she think she's the only "in shape" woman to give birth, or have a C section?
9 | Christopher Estes | 106 | 10154750520701336_10154752010071336 | Umm One or the biggest Elections for the US is a week away, and the world is waiting. But let's put this insignificant story up. We need new media. One America News seems to be the only real news out anymore.
10 | Michael Dietrich | 58 | 10154750520701336_10154752382191336 | Oh those inconvenient births,,, hurry up I have to take more pics of myself and post. The narcissism in American these days is just sad.
11 | Rob Tinsman | 31 | 10154750520701336_10154752156826336 | This has got to be the most idiotic article I've ever seen. As if people with higher body fat percentages don't have 6 pack abs underneath the fat.
12 | Ayla Mari | 36 | 10154750520701336_10154752358931336 | *rolls eyes*. I had a C-section almost seven months ago, they had to rip my son out too but I don't know if I felt like vomiting because I was too busy listening for my sons cry. My son was extremely stuck. His head is still weird shaped because of it. You're not special.
13 | Elise Anderson | 25 | 10154750520701336_10154752456271336 | Everyone's abdominal muscles tighten during vomiting. That's nothing new. And it's difficult many times for doctors to deliver the baby through the incision with a woman moving due to vomiting during the procedure. I've been an L&D nurse for over a decade and seen that occur on women of every size when vomiting happens during the delivery of the baby.
14 | Alex Gumiroff | 46 | 10154750520701336_10154752011291336 | Her incision is extremely low, no wonder they had a hard time delivering the baby.
15 | Annie Grace | 22 | 10154750520701336_10154752105066336 | Why has this made the news?? She's so overrated here in Australia. So you have tight abs when giving birth. Big whoop...Meanwhile there's other pressing news more important we should be focusing on....
16 | Brandi Lynn Ober | 15 | 10154750520701336_10154752472206336 | They struggle to remove any babies from a 6inch incision. Good for you girl to have some hard abs!!! I didn't.. and with my 8.8lb and my 11.14lb babies both C sections, it was a definite struggle to remove them as well as vomiting the whole time... it just is what it is...
17 | Jennifer Gibson Scott | 28 | 10154750520701336_10154752497146336 | Whaaa! I'm a new mommy. Hear the story of my war wounds and pay attention to me. My problem is my abs were too great. I was the first person ever to vomit on the c-sec table. Whaa!
18 | Laura Lavergne | 18 | 10154750520701336_10154752708316336 | Doctors struggled to rip my youngest child out of me, too, and my abs are more like a keg than a 6 pack. The only pregnancy exercise I got was fork lifts.This was just one more way for her to brag about her superwoman core. Get over yourself lol.
19 | Evangelica George | 30 | 10154750520701336_10154752099586336 | Selfish people. of course this would happen. Your kid was being strangled in a muscle cage. Pregnant bellies are supposed to be big and round - so the baby can grow and move.
20 | Donna Fisher | 10 | 10154750520701336_10154752459396336 | Has nothing to do with one's physique. I guess this story was a break from the election but really ridiculous. Didn't even bother reading...the caption was enough
21 | Amber Marie Yost | 4 | 10154750520701336_10154752542306336 | I am practically made of jello and my son still had a hard time getting through my c section incision. Not sure her abs had too much to do with that part. Glad momma and baby are doing well
22 | Tracey Achenbach | 7 | 10154750520701336_10154752660731336 | The reason that women vomit during their C-Sections, not just her and her "amazing" abs, is because of a drop in their blood pressures caused by their spinals or epidurals. Sympathetic inhibition...that is all.
23 | Natalie Davis | 7 | 10154750520701336_10154752562336336 | I think we are passed the point in society where women need to be reassured that c section scars are "okay". We know that. We know what they represent and every single person in the world is fine with that. I have never felt bad or embarrassed about mine.
24 | Tim Comania | 12 | 10154750520701336_10154752452351336 | So freakin sick and tired of these ultra fit mommies trying to one up the next woman. You're all insecure idiots! If you need the constant approval that posting a million selfies brings, maybe you should work on your mind instead of your body. Obviously you lack the mental strength to be happy with yourself.
25 | Pat Mcguire | 0 | 10154750520701336_811150792360634 | I am not an OB but I am a surgeon and for a C-section the patient usually has a spinal anesthetic (or general if it is an emergency) which relaxes the abdominal muscles no matter how fit the muscles. That being said, she looks great, good for her!

Hilary Duff and her boyfriend stirred up trouble when they showed up to a Halloween party dressed as a pilgrim and a Native American.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Emmanuel S. McDaniel | 10446 | 10154750235341336_10154751934141336 | Nothing to apologize for....gotta stop rewarding sensitive people.
2 | Lynda Preston | 9794 | 10154750235341336_10154751933086336 | come on...this should not be a problem....you let boys dress like girls for pete sakes
3 | Cody Ackerman | 8408 | 10154750235341336_10154751939516336 | When people are offended by a costume but not that one of our presidential nominees is being investigated by the FBI. We have a problem
4 | Maria Ginter Trump | 5105 | 10154750235341336_10154751934011336 | are you serious? What's wrong with their costumes. Lighten up, people. sheesh. as kids we were always cowboys and indians and pilgrims. give it a rest
5 | David Levi | 2445 | 10154750235341336_10154751940586336 | The only people you offended are some Killary supporters who are so butthurt  by PC , yet they vote for a lunatic criminal under an FBI investigation
6 | Jessica Brooks Hatcher | 2409 | 10154750235341336_10154751933541336 | Seriously...what is NOT offensive in 2016? Could someone just make us a list of PC costumes?
7 | Deanne Wilson | 1411 | 10154750235341336_10154751939291336 | Seriously? People these days get their panties in a wad over the dumbest things. She shouldn't have apologized for dressing up in a flipping costume. It's Halloween...you dress up in costumes. This world is ridiculous
8 | Hector Manuel Marrero | 1464 | 10154750235341336_10154751935331336 | The event that Americans commonly call the "First Thanksgiving" was celebrated by the Pilgrims after their first harvest in the New World in 1621. This feast lasted three days, and‚Äîas accounted by attendee Edward Winslow‚Äîit was attended by 90 Native Americans and 53 Pilgrims.
9 | Dixie Sweigard | 685 | 10154750235341336_10154751941611336 | I'm sure there are costumes out there of "Hillary Duff" should she be offended?! This is so stupid! I'm America Indian, I'm not a bit offended!
10 | Erin Pinson | 651 | 10154750235341336_1810041065874344 | One person has to ruin it for everyone... Who decided we should be offended by this? I'm Native American and I find nothing about this offensive. Because parents are raising marshmallow, overly sensitive, self-entitled narcissists, they're sucking the joy out of everything. If you have a problem with an Indian and Pilgrim costume, then go find an emotionally-neutral safe zone where you can whine and complain about how unfair and offensive reality is, and leave the rest of us humans to enjoy life.
11 | Barbara Crawley Adams | 494 | 10154750235341336_10154751937216336 | Kids always did that growing up. What is the problem now? Everyone needs to get over being so sensitive about their feelings and learn to be adults.
12 | Tammy Parker | 257 | 10154750235341336_10154751951461336 | I don't think she should have apologized. It isn't offensive at all. This a time for us to honor our ancestors... I'm so over this stupid politically correct world we now have to live in. My best friends daughter dressed as a native American this year too.. and there is nothing wrong with it since she is native. I'm native myself, albeit a very small percentage, so who exactly was butt hurt about the costume... was it a tribe? Or some stuffy white person who needs a safe place because words hurt? Ugg get over yourselves!
13 | Taunya Creasey | 148 | 10154750235341336_1070187259760579 | It's a flipping costume! I'm part American Indian and I think they are fabulous! The whole point of Halloween is to play dress up.....to pretend to be someone else for the night. Get off your high horses and let people have fun again! Here's an idea-if you are offended, then look elsewhere, go elsewhere, or stfu and mind your own freaking business!!!
14 | Phillip Peterman | 141 | 10154750235341336_10154751942646336 | Give me a break you liberal pricks - it's Halloween, when everyone wears costumes = Cripes, what is the country coming to........
15 | Denis Jeannotte | 145 | 10154750235341336_10154751937351336 | There are far more disturbing stories out there , people are being massacred and murdered at a biblical rate in the middle east and in Ukraine and no one seems to even care any longer , business as usual :(
16 | Ashley Phillips | 125 | 10154750235341336_10154751956906336 | OMG, who cares?? I saw a woman with two kids, one was a cowboy and the other was an Indian. People need to be slapped for whining about everything and making people feel like anything they do is just wrong because it goes against their opinion!!
17 | Liza Gomez Espinoza | 110 | 10154750235341336_1810011082544009 | Hillary Duff, its Halloween and you can wear whatever you want. People need to mind their business. It's a costume for crying out loud.......
18 | Mirella Billups | 102 | 10154750235341336_10154751950721336 | And what the hell is wrong with that????Do we want to take Native American Indians and pilgrims out of our history because they might offend???? Enough if this crap!!
19 | Melissa Kelley | 67 | 10154750235341336_1070185693094069 | My husband, who is Native American, isn't offended by this. It is Halloween and people dress up as all sorts of things. I'm by no means politically left or right but good lord pick your battles people! There's nothing to apologize for, especially considering in a few weeks most of us will partake in the tradition of  Thanksgiving. The decorations for that holiday mirror what she and her partner are wearing here.
20 | Carole Harris | 61 | 10154750235341336_10154751962691336 | Pilgrims and American Indians= part of America's history...Pocahontas?John Smith....Jamestown, Virginia.....What am I missing? Is this a part of history we are to forget for some reason???
21 | Janine DeRocckis Aguero | 72 | 10154750235341336_10154751948681336 | How is this offensive??? I'm at a loss...ridiculous!!!! Stop apologizing to these sensitive people. Get over it. It's Halloween!!!
22 | Michael Gene Ring | 59 | 10154750235341336_10154751940731336 | Next the left and all these liberal crybabies will be offended because people step outside of their homes as people, you know dressed as a human.... oh my the agony, it disturbs me to the core, they were dressed as people..... hahahahaha!!! Get over it!!!!!!
23 | Caroline K. DeHart | 42 | 10154750235341336_1807536309458631 | As an American Indian I DO NOT find the costumes offensive. People need to quit being so sensitive and babyish. There is nothing wrong with Indians or Pilgrims. They are PART OF OUR HISTORY!
24 | Debi Chapman | 48 | 10154750235341336_1070187603093878 | Never apologize for portraying history. Never apologize for any costume that is niether lewd or vulgar.  Many performers cross that line (Miley, Beyonce, etc.) and people pay to see them grateful around barely clothed.  Seriously. Lighten up, snowflakes!  It's Halloween, for crying out loud. If you're offended, go to your safe place in your mommy's basement.
25 | Rosemary Kirkland | 63 | 10154750235341336_1874813116072055 | I don't personally care much for Hilary Duff but I have to back her up on this....There were Pilgrims am I right?? And when the pilgrims landed they found Indians...right? So what is the big snort about dressing up as one of them? Just because they wear a costume for Halloween does not mean they mean any harm to anyone....it looks cute!!! That's it! Just the look!Has nothing to do with trying to offend or disrespect anyone or anything! Get over yourselves and have some fun!

Police in North Carolina say a Pizza Hut employee used his own handgun to shoot and kill one of three people trying to rob his store over the weekend.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Anthony Trivette | 3107 | 10154750198491336_10154751867566336 | Probably gonna be fired because it's against company policy, but good for him, he gets to go home alive.
2 | Hannah-Rose Harding Pepe | 1732 | 10154750198491336_10154751889566336 | As long as he had a license to carry, good for him. If he broke company policy, so what. At least he's alive and can go find a job somewhere else. And for all of you crying over the idiot he shot... don't wanna get shot? Then don't attempt a robbery!
3 | Chris Arria | 543 | 10154750198491336_10154751869221336 | Barack Obama disapproves of this brave person's actions. They should have let them rob the store, and just begged the robbers not to harm anybody instead of resorting to sickening gun violence. Reasoning with criminals is always the logical approach to take when your life is in danger, according to every Democrat.
4 | Ryan Myers | 606 | 10154750198491336_10154751866791336 | Remember when Trump was laughed at for saying Hillary had the questions ahead of time? Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.#MAGA #Trump2016
5 | Brad Steinberg | 409 | 10154750198491336_10154751867961336 | Heroes are not celebrities or athletes. Heroes are people like this employee.
6 | Martin Meyer | 387 | 10154750198491336_10154751867866336 | So what? He's protecting customers and fellow employees. Only feminized liberal men would oppose something like this.
7 | Oliver Rodriguez | 237 | 10154750198491336_10154751905201336 | He should've fought them off with love, and understanding instead......Wait, what?! Fuuuuccckkk that! Hats off to that employee! #UpholdThe2nd #FuckObama #FuckHillary!!
8 | Kevin Edmonds | 203 | 10154750198491336_10154751866871336 | The left will find some way to label him as a racist fascist gun-loving bigot.
9 | Matt Spano | 137 | 10154750198491336_10154751881086336 | Ahh liberals idiots are out tonight. Play stupid games like robbing people and win stupid prizes. Like being shot by someone who is smart enough to protect themselves and not be a liberal sheep.
10 | Kevin Doiel | 74 | 10154750198491336_10154751918386336 | Pizza Hut may fire the guy, but he should definitely think of going into Law Enforcement or the military. 1 out of 3 ain't bad! Way to go, and he saved himself and other employees lives!
11 | Alex Stelling | 81 | 10154750198491336_10154751883321336 | What are the chances another armed robber goes into that Pizza Hut? That has to be one of the safest restaurants in the world right now!
12 | Jason Martin | 58 | 10154750198491336_10154751885856336 | That's just not right. Had that employee not had a gun, the armed robbers would have known and put their weapons down because criminals have ESP you know. Good for him. Glad that store didn't get robbed and NO INNOCENT PEOPLE WERE HARMED
13 | Chris Kirk | 69 | 10154750198491336_10154751949871336 | The family of the guy who died will probably sue Pizza Hut for wrongful death and win because that's how messed up this country is. It's to bad he didn't put the other 2  guys in body bags.
14 | Michael Martino | 60 | 10154750198491336_10154751914921336 | A GOOD guy with a legal gun, is the answer to the BAD guys with ILLEGAL guns !2nd amendment rights!Hillary wants to take that from us, but will do NOTHING to clean our streets of the Gangs and Thugs!
15 | Erica Gandy Paddock | 40 | 10154750198491336_10154751904896336 | Good for him. He probably saved more lives than he took. If it's them or you, you shoot to kill. He has every right to protect himself and others.
16 | Jon Handel | 51 | 10154750198491336_10154751889161336 | I really hope the shooter is white and the dead suspect is black. I'd love to hear the #BlackLivesMatter clowns explain that one.I really don't care their skin color. Could be a Latino guy shooting a white dude for all I care. I just enjoy seeing hypocrites flop and twitch as they come up with something clever to say.
17 | Herbert Mcginnis | 34 | 10154750198491336_10154751898661336 | The sooner we get guns in all LAW ABIDING HANDS,the sooner armed crimes will will fall precipitously. WHY? Cause armed thugs are COWARDS.They don't have the  guts to face U knowing U MIGHT be armed. Someone once once said "Killmn all,let God sort them out
18 | Dan Shurwin | 65 | 10154750198491336_10154751867136336 | Good for the employee 1 less thug to bad he didn't shoot all 3
19 | Marissa Cardin | 36 | 10154750198491336_10154751890721336 | What's sad is he'll probably be fired for having a gun at work üôÑ but he's alive, and so are the other people that were there too
20 | Michael Strauch | 19 | 10154750198491336_10154751894451336 | I ran one of these 30 yrs ago and it wasn't open until 1:30 AM. There was one attempt on my life to steal the proceeds and after that I went out to the bank armed. Jobs were real hard to find then but when I got the chance I left.
21 | PeggyMarie Sees | 23 | 10154750198491336_10154751885306336 | Great job! More of this would rebuild respect for others Property and set boundaries they obviously were not taught as a child.
22 | Steven Grotano | 19 | 10154750198491336_10154751903966336 | I'd give the guy a raise! You hear stories like this and sometimes the employee gets killed for no reason,it's either me or him and it certainly aint gonna be,especially if I'm carrying

24 | Justin Burgess | 12 | 10154750198491336_10154752195841336 | Should of called the police, and waited.  Could had a pizza ready by the time they got there, and then sat down to discuss the incident.  HAHA who am I kidding, he should of fired a few nore rounds chasing the other 2.
25 | John Abbott | 8 | 10154750198491336_691069734402650 | Luckily, here in Chicago, we have these little signs of handguns with a circle and slash through them. So not only do thieves know better than to bring their guns inside to rob places, but the employee would have been stopped from killing the person with the gun.

"Hillary Clinton says, 'Donald J. Trump, oh he's not fit to serve in the Oval Office.' But she, and she alone, has created a situation that could do severe damage to this country and the office of the presidency."
 
Do you agree with Sean Hannity?

5 | Amir Parvez | 258 | 10154751584941336_10154751787286336 | Hillary Clinton is a threat to American Democracy (what's left of it) and world peace. A vote for her is a vote for worldwide economic slavery and evil, endless war! She's a corrupt, evil, lying warmonger who already has blood on her hands of thousands of people and millions of dollars of blood money in the Clinton Foundation. #NeverHillary

I keep wondering if the zombies are coming next because we have truly entered Armageddon.

12 | Martin E. Morales | 33 | 10154751584941336_10154751811716336 | Hilary has damaged the image of our country. The entire world has been wondering why she is allowed to run, and at the same time why Obama is supporting her. Maybe they dont know that Obama is a Muslim traitor to this country.

16 | Lynn Mullins-Hamilton | 16 | 10154751584941336_10154751826451336 | Yes....1000!Hillary is a liar and a crook.I fail to see how anyone who is loyal to this country, who wants our kids to live in freedom could vote for Clinton.It is disturbing to see and hear our elected officials stand back and do nothing and even condone her behavior and support her.They should be protecting our country, the people and doing their jobs to represent the people in pursuing justice, integrity, and honor.The FACT they are not doing it bipartisan shows they have corrupt skeletons in their closets and are terrified they will be exposed.Eventually it will all come out.Where are the people of this country standing?When talking to my daughter it is painful to explain that people don't care enough to stand up for our country.It's sad that american people have become so blind, willing to condone elicite, criminal, and corrupt behavior.She does not understand how people are letting Hillary Clinton do these things without consequences.It is hard for her to realize that the very people who have taught her to be, respectful, responsible, and safe....are only expecting her and her classmates to do it but it's ok for people like Clinton to do the things she has done.What can you tell a child? Its not ok and anyone who is condoning a supporting her is guilty. Its the truth and it leaves a bitter feeling in your stomache. The reality is you can't trust anyone to do the right thing, to support what is right, to demand truth, justice, and accountability,There in lies the problem with younger generations....they see and live in a world where they have been taught that certain people arebove the law and allowed to do whatever they want.So very sad....unfortunately it's the deity of who the people of this country have become.
17 | Jesse Ortega Laforteza | 26 | 10154751584941336_1777943845803726 | That's the reason why the Elitists, the Washington establishments, the corrupt politicians from both parties are against an outsider, like  Mr Trump to be elected. All their bad plans against the American people will be stopped. Mr. Trump is leading WE THE PEOPLE movement to SAVE our country. May God shield and protect Mr. Trump from any form of dangers.
18 | Miguel A. Santiago | 21 | 10154751584941336_10154751821596336 | We don't need to take criminal and dangerous refugees. That is not our problem and We are not making it our problem. Let them stay in their country to fight their wars. There is no benefit for bringing more terrorists to the United States than We already have. Liberals, get your heads out of your butts.
19 | Don Tynan | 18 | 10154751584941336_10154751822026336 | She claims to be a chmpion for children. What kind of example does she really think she is setting for the young, and those with simple minds? At least Nixon had the courage to know when it was time to quit.
20 | Leonard Lopez | 7 | 10154751584941336_1777944285803682 | Sean Hannity is one of the worse phoniest humans to ever live. He spouts lies and propaganda on a daily basis. He should be tried for treason. He is so un-American
21 | Ro Spez | 11 | 10154751584941336_528748080657508 | Well, if this country doesn't see justice, I hate to see what will happen. Comey better not think he's going to cover up the 2nd time! We all know this should have all come out a long time ago! The fact that she lied and destroyed all those emails is enough to prosecute , and America knows! Stop treating us like we're  ignorant fools! We know the truth and Comey better do what's right or he will lose all respect!
22 | Carmen Graham Rice | 13 | 10154751584941336_10154751853301336 | Will she become the first USA Dictator? After the election, if she wins, she can be either pardoned by Obama or by her self. Then she can do what ever she desires without true consequence, because she can pardon herself. What will this country become??? If you read the laws and IF she WINS, it's truly terrifying!
23 | Gail Joy Abbott | 11 | 10154751584941336_528747693990880 | I'm thinking Hillary was using Huma's laptop as a back up for all the emails she bleached and deleted from her own computer and server. Who would have thought to look at her top aides computer for 650,000 deleted emails?? Just a thought!
24 | Margarita Martell-Maxwell | 4 | 10154751584941336_10154751823476336 | COULD??? This country has been long damaged since 911!!!! She's going to make a change once and for all! Let's see what happens in the next 4 years! Let her prove it to you!!! George W. Bush, leaked out 66,000 emails during his presidency..., yup! and then????
25 | Dick Benedettini | 21 | 10154751584941336_10154751812631336 | If she is elected he is right our country will no longer be the land of the free. I am so sick of her lies and she keeps telling more when are they going to lock her up. Wake up out there u idiots who will vote for her. If we where in her shoes they would put us in jail and throw the key away. It's time to put her behind bars

5 | Kalie Hawk McCoy | 101 | 10154750501111336_10154751731766336 | Welcome to the dark side, Doug. I, too, was a democrat, and voted for Bill. However, today's democratic party is something I don't even recognize.  I knew there was corruption in government, but the Clintons are like the mac daddies of corruption. Once you've seen it, you can't UNsee it. Not sure I'm a republican now, or if I'm just a deplorable. Either way, welcome aboard, and go Trump!
6 | Bru Ploog | 48 | 10154750501111336_10154751701081336 | Maybe a moot point, but shes NOT the sec. of state, John Kerry is. This is not a title like queen that carries with you forever. She is now either "former" sec of state, or former senator, but is currently simply "mrs. clinton", or presidential candidate clinton. Just torques me that the talking heads still call her secretary clinton! Argggg!
7 | Melody Gabriel | 25 | 10154750501111336_10154751772166336 | So agree with Doug Schoen! People need to drop the emotions and egos and realize this is deeply serious! This is ten times more important than Watergate was........and that resulted in Nixon resigning before being impeached!

I'm glad to see that even the most hard core supporters have a limit. I just hope he takes millions of Americans with him, even if he just stays home.
9 | Candice Lindley | 18 | 10154750501111336_10154751713721336 | He has a great point. How could she even try to do the job as President? She couldn't. She's involved in being investigated by the FBI and numerous scandals. She couldn't possibly do a proper job.
10 | Liz Steger Parthum | 10 | 10154750501111336_10154752310036336 | Finally a reasonable democrat who can see Hillary for who she is: a criminal who has repeatedly put her own interests at the top of her list and compromised America in the process.  Trump may not be a shining candidate either, but at least he's not under federal investigation.  The choice has become crystal clear and I have nothing but respect for Doug Schoen for having the guts to put it out there.

Doug Schoen would've never taken this position if there wasn't a huge fire behind that smoke.
14 | Lou Carter | 11 | 10154750501111336_10154751736351336 | Refreshing! A democrat with a conscience! I know, there are MANY others as well. Nothing wrong with wanting the truth. The American people, us, deserve an honest government.

How Could or Can Anybody Vote for HER. Dirty Rotten Snakes. Kaine Warren, Comey, Obama, Lynch, George Soros and Hillary are all Lying, morally corrupt ,scumbags, intent on feathering there own nest at any cost, even at the expense of American lives. They should be held accountable for their treasonous and illegal actions. If this were any other citizen, they would have been imprisoned a long time ago. What happened to our constitution where everyone is accountable under the law? Our system is now so corrupt under this administration, that anything goes and is acceptable. It is unconscionable, unacceptable, morally wrong and we the people need to stand up to this tyranny, before Hillary lies herself into the presidency and destroys this great nation forever. We have the ability to determine the future of our country, if we stand united and vote for Trump in November. If we do not and Hillary wins, we will have no one to blame, but ourselves. God bless America.. They are so EVIL and Corrupt SOB's
24 | Julie Borges Hice | 0 | 10154750501111336_1213402332079419 | An FBI source has confirmed that evidence has emerged from the Clinton email investigation that a massive child trafficking and pedophile sex ring operates in Washington.According to reports, at least 6 members of Congress and several leaders from federal agencies are implicated in the pedophile ring, which they say was run directly with the Clinton Foundation as a front.According to an NYPD source, emails found on Anthony Weiner‚Äôs laptop detail trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary Clinton on convicted pedophile pal billionaire Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs plane ‚ÄòLolitta express‚Äò to a place known as ‚ÄúSex Slave Island‚Äú.

Donald J. Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the recent Wikileaks revelations and investigation into Hillary Clinton show she "puts herself and her own personal interests before your own."

Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.#MAGA

5 | Tj Irby | 21 | 10154751554221336_10154751616426336 | A newly leaked email from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Campaign Manager John Podesta is titled ‚ÄúHillary actions / unpleasant odor.‚Äù‚ÄúPeople tell me that Hillary is acting ‚Äòlike a retard‚Äô since her head injury,‚Äù wrote Podesta on March 22, 2015. ‚ÄúFrankly, considering her normal behavior, I‚Äôm surprised anyone noticed! (this is a joke!) Have someone talk to her doctor and see if there‚Äôs anything he can give her.‚Äù‚ÄúAlso, I‚Äôve noticed she‚Äôs had an ‚Äòodor‚Äô lately,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIt reminds me of a combination of boiled cabbage, urine and farts. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs either connected to her fall or simply the fact that she rarely bathes.‚Äù‚ÄúOutside of encouraging her to take a shower once in a while, I don‚Äôt know what to do about this. ‚Äî any suggestions would be appreciated.‚ÄùRead more: https://ihavethetruth.com/2016/10/31/john-podesta-hillary-is-acting-like-a-retard-she-smells-like-boiled-cabbage-urine-and-farts/#ixzz4OiPcbb
6 | Ryan Galati | 27 | 10154751554221336_10154751612546336 | Hillary and the rest of the Democrats will continue to deny everything. Back in July James Comey was a hero for the Democrats, now that he is reopening the investigation he is bias they say. They make fun of Trump for saying it's rigged and then THEY SAY THE SAY THING. The FBI is doing a wonderful thing hats off to them.
7 | Vance Adolph | 18 | 10154751554221336_10154751612641336 | I love the way Hillary rolls her eyes when she is speaking, as if she is charming. I'd like to make a video of those rolling eyes to the tune of Tiny Tim's "Tiptoe thru the Tulips"
8 | Robert Anthony | 26 | 10154751554221336_10154751681966336 | In the year 2000 I had the privilege of working on Mr. Trump‚Äôs security staff in the Trump Tower. Let me just say that he is a real man, a real boss, and a real caring and loving person.He and his personal bodyguard Matt Calamari (now Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice-President) treated us like family and when we came into contact with Mr. Trump we addressed him as Mr. Trump, or Sir, not because it was something we were told to do, but rather out of respect. I hold Mr Trump in the highest regard.On 9/13/2001 I was walking out of the pile of concrete, steel, glass, and human debris that was Ground Zero as Mr. Trump was walking in. I think he was with Kevin or Brian (bodyguards), not sure which, but I addressed Mr. Trump and gave him a few breathing masks, then exited the site. This was months after I left the TRUMP organization for family issues.No more then one hour later I was receiving calls from Trump Tower stating that Mr. Trump was very proud to see me lending a hand to help our people and that they would like me to come back to work in the TRUMP organization.This is personal for me, and as a 100% disabled veteran fighting medical bills that the VA refuses to pay I know I need a man like Mr. Trump to stick up for people like me and for the rest of our great nation.God Bless Mr. Trump and God Bless America!‚Äù
9 | Randy Prewitt | 15 | 10154751554221336_10154751630896336 | This is out of control! She needs to drop out! I read a snarky meme that fit this most appropriately and it read: "Hey Hillary, how do you like being aborted 10 days before delivery?"
10 | Clifton Scott | 9 | 10154751554221336_10154751651391336 | Kellyanne Conway is a vary good campaign manager. Mr. Trump always picks the right people. when he wins the presidency, I hope he keeps her in his administration. I truly believe Trump will win this. I already voted in GA for Trump. Go Trump!!!
11 | Alec Gormley | 11 | 10154751554221336_10154751621456336 | Why Weiner would have her emails is the reason there is concern, why anyone would have her emails is beyond policy. Some may think it is trivial but then people do prison time for less and we all know it.
12 | Debra Fulmer Sullivan | 25 | 10154751554221336_10154751630096336 | All these Dems sure have short memories -- Hillary couldn't recall 40 times, Cheryl Mills couldn't remember 189 times and Slick Willy's memory failed him 267 times while under oath. Get the picture?
13 | Alec Gormley | 5 | 10154751554221336_10154751650466336 | It is a matter of ethics not to vote for Hillary how can we trust anyone in government colluding with different branches to thwart justice. Shame on them a votr for Hillary is a vote for treason against our democracy.
14 | Rose Gold | 15 | 10154751554221336_10154751617001336 | Clinton never hid any secrets from using email. But Trump, every second he opens his mouth he lies. He owes the government millions of dollars because he never paid any taxes. The chunk of money could build some roads for you!
15 | Juanita Dean | 6 | 10154751554221336_10154751648121336 | I totally agree...Hillary doesn't care about the American people. If she did she would step down. If she cared she wouldn't try to rig the election. She's crooked. Hillary can not be trusted.
16 | Harvey Collins | 7 | 10154751554221336_10154751665616336 | This country will fall if she becomes president. I don't know how anyone can vote for her knowing she under investigation.God Bless American.This county will never be the same. I really feel sorry for this young kids. That has know ideal what's they going to be facing. So mom and dad what you going to tell your kids if this country falls because you voted for Hillary Clinton.

19 | Dayar Vrenezi | 9 | 10154751554221336_10154751612406336 | Doesn't really matter at this point. Because Hilary Clinton grabbed Trump by the p*ssy throughout this election. Hilary for prez!
20 | Robert Grove | 1 | 10154751554221336_10154751743331336 | See... here's the funny thing. Illegally obtained evidence cannot be used in a legal prosecution for a crime. So if the cops find your smoking gun as the result of an illegal search, it may prove that you committed a murder, but they can't use it in court. However, that proof will still convict you in the court of public opinion. Everyone will know you're a murderer, even if you got away with it. So it's entirely possible that nothing in the wikileaks releases can be used to prosecute Hillary Clinton in court. But they still exist, and no matter how they try to deflect the blame or distract the public, the fact remains that these e-mails exist, and the people in question did write them. Not enough to convict in a legal court. But then, and election is the ultimate court of public opinion, isn't it?
21 | Travis Levan | 1 | 10154751554221336_10154751725636336 | At least once in awhile Hillary Clinton has worked to improve the lives of millions of women and children. Donald Trump has never done anything in his entire life that benefitted anyone whose name wasn't TRUMP.
22 | Matt Allen | 0 | 10154751554221336_1145466788865835 | You know what this whole FBI thing and Hillary Clinton if she gets him to be president the investigation stops and no criminal charges could be brought against her even if they find it that she did do everything that they said she did foreign governments got a hold of it paid to play Everything she could be found completely guilty but once she becomes president nothing you can do about it the investigation stops all legal things against her completely stopped
23 | Jesse Ortega Laforteza | 2 | 10154751554221336_10154751724581336 | RE-POSTING WITH PERMISSION---Read carefully and please verify it by looking it up yourself Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:‚Äú(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.‚ÄùYes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us. Post this everywhere
24 | Jody Conrad | 0 | 10154751554221336_567447600116783 | When you have people like John Ashe, UN ambassador, set to testify against Hillary, suddenly die just hours before whistle blowing Hillary's corruption; when you have a DNC staffer, Seth Rich, suddenly die just hours before whistle blowing Hillary's corruption; when you have another DNC staffer, Shawn Lucas, suddenly die just hours before whistle blowing Hillary's corruption.......it is not just a moral issue for Americans, but rather a 'can-you-do-the-statistical-math,' the probability of that kind of 'trifecta coincidence' happening within days of each other during a presidential election. Mathematical Morals Matter. Just another ......  F.B.I. = Federally, Botched, Investigation.  ~MadFarmWife
25 | Steph Corbin | 2 | 10154751554221336_10154751623986336 | has anyone read a tom Clancy novel where Jack Ryan is always the american hero who defeats the enemy?has anyone read a tom Clancy novel where Jack Ryan is always the american hero who defeats the enemy?tom Clancy couldn't even write a novel where you would have to suspend disbelief enough to get through a book that narrates this presidential election. you literally have the antagonist who is Hillary, who has a lieutenant Hum Abadine is working for the Muslim brotherhood, (her mother is a member) and the Protagonist who is Trump (the american businessman)who is trying to defeat the corruption, but a rambunctious character. Then, on top of your novel you have a character named Wiener who sends wiener pics. Then you have the FBI who covered up for the antagonist then in toward end of this fictional novel does the right thing and stands up for the protagonist and the american people by doing the right thing and exposing the enemy (Clinton) and her international scams and her bribes and lies, but so far in the story then we don't have an ending for it yet because we don't have a winner yet in the election. This is straight out of a Tom Clancy novel. Now Jack Ryan would end up winning for the united states and ill be bias Donald Trump is our american protagonist in this story.you couldn't even write a fictional novel this well without suspending disbelief. litereally look whats going on.

1 | Katie Hamby | 628 | 10154750270996336_10154751507011336 | I believe we need a candidate that supports life, and Donald trump is that candidate. Hillary Clinton is the opposite of someone who supports life. How can you support partial birth abortions?
2 | Toni Shutt | 476 | 10154750270996336_10154751519046336 | I can never understand why it's not murder for an abortion but it's considered a double homicide if the mom is killed while still carrying the baby. There is no logical sense to that. A baby is not created from two dead things. Life begins at conception. Plus, if my son's biological mom would have aborted him, I would never have a child.
3 | Teresa Spitzer Ray | 330 | 10154750270996336_10154751520006336 | I met a women not long ago who was told that her baby would only have a 2% chance of living after birth,. Her doctors advised her to get an abortion, right up until her 9th month.  Her baby was perfectly healthy and is now 2 1/2 years old.  She chose life, and has a precious little girl.
4 | Tina Hoeft | 188 | 10154750270996336_10154751519226336 | My cousin was given a 0% chance her baby would be born, if she was, she would of been stillborn! She how has a healthy 4 yr. old daughter! Not a darn thing wrong with her! She was told this by 2 different Dr's! Just proves they don't know everything! They are NOT God!
5 | Daryl Proenza | 189 | 10154750270996336_10154751506231336 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...
6 | Zach Kitzmiller | 168 | 10154750270996336_10154751518776336 | My thing is - just don't use government funding to do it. I pay taxes and I don't want those taxes paying for someone's abortion. Their food? Sure. Their shelter? Sure. Their murder (regardless if you disagree or not that it's murder)? NO WAY!
7 | Mary Sprinkle | 78 | 10154750270996336_10154751521711336 | This is not a unique situation. I have heard stories from multiple women who have been encouraged to get abortions because of either potential health risks for themselves or even genetic defects in the baby. And then nothing happens! Mother and baby are fine in SO MANY cases.
8 | Kathy Lamb | 55 | 10154750270996336_10154751532381336 | I was told that there was less than a 20% chance that me and the baby would make it. My Dr was a family friend and advised me to terminate. My daughter is perfectly healthy and eleven years old. It wasn't always easy, but oh my God was it worth it ‚ù§
9 | Hamidreza Azarmehr | 83 | 10154750270996336_10154751507991336 | Hillary Clinton once said someone who was under FBI investigation shouldn't have been allowed to buy a gun. That's very true!!! Now someone who is also back under FBI investigation should not be allowed to run for President of the United States either.   Hillary Clinton should drop out of the Presidential race immediately.
10 | De Leah Owens Kohl | 18 | 10154750270996336_10154751571386336 | I am reading all these really great stories about women being advised to abort and yet they didn't. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but ultimately wasn't it  these individual women's choice. I am not by any means saying I agree with abortion. But I am saying it's a woman's right to choose what goes on with her own body. Her choice, and what ever that choice is, she will have to live with. It is not up to me to judge her. What if there were a law, that stated if a Dr thinks a woman will have an abnormal baby, they demand that it's aborted? And if you didn't you would be breaking the law. How would people feel then? Don't judge unless you can walk in their shoes, and unless you are up for sainthood.
11 | Bill Schaffer | 32 | 10154750270996336_10154751549591336 | If a pregnant womans' urine test indicates cocaine use,she can be arrested for distributing drugs to a minor.If a pregnant woman who takes an illegal drug she can be prosecuted for delivering a controlled substance to a minor.This is an explicit recognition that the unborn IS A PERSON with rights deserving protection even from his/her mother.However, that same woman who's prosecuted and jailed for endangering her child is free to abort that same child.In America today it's illegal to harm your preborn child,but it's perfectly legal to kill him.If alchohol harms unborn babies, what does abortion do to them?In 2004 Congress passed the "Unborn Victims of Violence Act" which states that someone who intentionally kills or attemptsto kill the unborn child be punished for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being. Consider the bizarre implications of the double standard if a woman is scheduled to get an abortion but on the way to the abortion clinic her baby is killed in-utero,the babies killer will be prosecuted for murder,but if this murder dosen't occur,an hour later the doctor will be paid to preform a legal procedure killing exactly the same child(in a way that is probably more gruesome)To the child what's the difference who kills her?Human beings shouldn't be discriminated against because of their place of residence.There's nothing about birth that makes a baby essentially different than he was before birth.There's no magic that changes a childs nature when she moves 20 inches from inside her mother to outside.Many states have passed homicide laws declaring it murder for anyone but the mother to deliberately take the life of a preborn child.These laws are the explicit affirmations that the child is a human being.Personhood has an inherent value that comes from being a member of the human race.According to The Bible this is part of being created in God's image.But who determines which lives are meaningful and which aren't.The answer always is that powerful people decide whether weaker peoples' lives are meaningful.We have a brief opportunity-a lifetime on earth-to use our resources to make a difference for eternity.
12 | Courtney Smith | 24 | 10154750270996336_10154751540531336 | You see story after story like this where doctors tell a couple that their child is incompatible with life and time after time they are WRONG! Doctors are great, but they're not God. No reason to ever kill a child.
13 | Samantha Traver | 20 | 10154750270996336_10154751577651336 | AMEN! My 24 week Miracle is now almost 4! He was 1lb 11oz! Was told to terminate. But I didn't! I had him 1 day later!ONE DAY! Let that stink in.I had him one day after a doctor told me to kill him because he wouldn't make it... he's now almost 4, and perfect!
14 | Dana Birdwell Shofner | 20 | 10154750270996336_10154751578711336 | I know so many parents who want to adopt. Why don't we use our taxes to support adoption services instead of planned parenthood?! I'm appalled at the evil our country is supporting :(
15 | Vanessa Elizabeth DiVittorio | 9 | 10154750270996336_10154751602451336 | Ok but are you also going to report on the woman who gave birth when the doctors said she could abort and both her and the child died in the process?That is not your choice to make.
16 | Alec Gormley | 13 | 10154750270996336_10154751518766336 | We live in a one shoe fits all society, I believe if we just give it a chance it will be ok even if it is different. People helping people with the same needs is what it is about, abortion is a cop out.
17 | Gabe Brunner | 35 | 10154750270996336_10154751509621336 | There is no debate to rational people. Life starts at conception, period.

19 | Carole A. Brewer | 10 | 10154750270996336_10154751515671336 | just read this article on someone else's newsfeed. It's a real eye opener to say the least!Let me explain a few things to people who don't understand how this will end. People call these Muslims refugees! BS... this is an army invading our country under the assumption they are refugees. This is the only way to invade America from the inside and people say why we are strong and yes America is a super power. Killary wants to bring in 500,000 more how many are already here?. People say they are nice people I live with them and work with them, that is a red herring. Once they have enough and that will be soon if Killary is elected president. And listen to this very closely because it's no joke. Once they have the numbers here it will begin, and remember Obumer is closing Guantanamo Bay and bringing the worst of the worst Muslim leaders here to America. Why would you say does it matter well I'm going to tell you. Once the numbers are here and your "Social Security is funding all this " then they will detonate EMP bombs around America where it will do the most damage to the grid. Now some people ask what is a EMP bomb. It will destroy anything that is electrical, ie cars ,planes, generators,cell phones you get my point now. How will that be bad people ask, so I will explain . America will return to the dark ages no power to stay warm or cook no ac to stay cool no way to ship food no way to keep meat good. No place to buy food no way to call for help so people ask why would I need to call for help. Well that's when these so called refugees will turn into an Army that will start the take over of America. They will go from town to towns state to state and they will kill you cut your head's off they will rape and pillage everything and everyone they have contact with. Christians will be killed without mercy. I'll fight you say I'll call the cops or the army someone. No you won't no way to call for help phones won't work and Killary has already taken our guns so your fight won't last long. ie. Don't bring a gun to a knife fight. But don't worry Killary will set up FEMA camps for your protection she will say but many will be killed in these camps. How will you feed your family with no food no stores no walmart. So many Americans will die from starvation in the first month alone it will be sick. And then you have people in your own town that will try to take what you have to feed their's. Race groups killing and pillaging anywhere they want. America will be lost forever meanwhile all those countries that hate America will attack because we will be like sitting ducks in a pond. So prepare the best you can because this is what you are voting for if you vote this traitor as president. Some of you idiot's will laugh but I assure you when it happens it will be no laughing matter when your young girls are raped in front of you and watch as your sons and husband's heads are cut off. And no one will be able to help you you won't be able to fight because Killary took our right as American citizens all so she can fill her pockets. Obumer is Muslim plant that has brainwashed Killary into destroying the country she says she loves. Trump is our only way out of this out come so be smart people think for yourselfs and let's make America the great country it was before this traitor took control. You need to ask yourselfs why would any United States president give 400 million dollars to country like Iran that is the biggest funder of terrorist Go Trump/Pence Drain those swamps
20 | Angie Phifer | 7 | 10154750270996336_10154751583686336 | Happy for this Mom who chose to have this baby. It sickens me to know HRC wants to abort full term babies and called mentally ill children "Fu-king Retards". She will pay for that and Satan is waiting standing at the gates of Hell to greet her.
21 | Mary Miedel Seibel | 7 | 10154750270996336_10154751545981336 | Breaks me heart to think of all these kinds of could have beens. I personally know 2 people who were told to abort because of problems and they BOTH have beautiful, healthy children...not our decison to make to end a life üíìüíìüíì
22 | Robyn Young | 5 | 10154750270996336_10154751587281336 | I was born out of a rape and my parents loved me and I had no close till I was in my 30s. I also had my appendix rupture and they told me to abort and i wouldn't  sign the papers. That child is 26 years old and a marine and I have been so blessed. For myself no option because of who I am, for others it is their choice but just don't use my tax dollars and use abortion as. Birth control. I've seen that and I can't imagine. And counsel people who are getting it so they know what happens so they know ALL the facts. So many women have guilt and more down the road.
23 | Jeannette Carmickle Walsh | 3 | 10154750270996336_10154751678201336 | As a Christian, female veteran, a mother, a grandmother there is no way I could support or vote for a woman, a mother, a grandmother who supports and wants more funding for a 36 week  abortions. This is horrible and the selling of body parts of unborn babies. This is just pure evil!

25 | Joanna Mcnabb Newman | 1 | 10154750270996336_10154751720131336 | Good for you mom. Your little one is adorable! My son had cancer. Different situation, but still it was my child's life on the line. We didn't get the happy ending we wanted- yet. But we did do everything we knew how, and we gave it the best fight we could until he went to heaven. Sure know what it's like to suffer PTSD. But like you said, we did everything we could. I'm glad we did. It's hard enough to deal with that kind of a loss, but to have guilt as well, that would have been unbearable. Blessings to you and yours! Enjoy that little one. Such a precious gift.

EXCLUSIVE: Billionaire Sheldon Adelson just committed $25 million to an anti-Hillary Clinton Super PAC to try and help tilt the presidential race and down ballot House and Senate races to Republicans, Fox News learned Monday.

2 | Brian Isgrigg | 511 | 10154751259951336_10154751374516336 | We are going to win so much, we are going to have win after win after win! And you people are going to get sick and tired of winning, you people are going to say " Please please President Trump we can't take this much victory, please stop we don't want any more wins". And I'm going to say to you, "We are going to win, I don't care what you say, we are going to make our country great again! We're going to win! We're going to win! And we're going to win!
3 | Kristen Stromberger | 394 | 10154751259951336_10154751381016336 | Funny how the tables are turning against her. I hope that flight log gets published along with the dirty details of the Weiner emails. This country needs to see what it's trying to elect!
4 | Lisa Ledford | 420 | 10154751259951336_10154751372456336 | I don't understand why no one has brought up that fact that OBAMA  used a pseudonym - his hands are dirty too - why would he do that unless he knew she was breaking the law with unsecure illegal servers- they need to do search on what he said in the infamous emails
5 | James Branigan | 305 | 10154751259951336_10154751388821336 | I for one applaud Adelson's decision to support not only Trump but republican running for reelection in the house & senate.  Trump needs a majority in both houses, in the first 4 years, to really make all his plans for reform in this country happen.  Go Trump.
6 | Daryl Proenza | 369 | 10154751259951336_10154751381526336 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...
7 | Jessica Brooks Hatcher | 272 | 10154751259951336_10154751382511336 | Why not? Obama's campaigning for Hillary on the taxpayer dime. Atleast Adelson's contribution isn't costing the middle class taxpayer. Woohoo!
8 | Mike Brown | 96 | 10154751259951336_10154751416291336 | Past time for ALL Republican career politicians who trashed Trump to jump on board. The train is leaving without you and be darn certain we the people will remember you when you're up for re-election
9 | Kenneth Banning | 74 | 10154751259951336_10154751409251336 | The people that make me feel guilty for voting for Trump can go screw themselves. Hillary's had over thirty years to get things right and still hasn't. Obama has damaged people with his Obama care and more on the way. He wants to take care of refugees while our own suffer. Democrats have screwed up enough and republicans , it was supposed to be We the PEOPLE. It's gotten where both parties are lining their own pockets and to hell with the people. Disgusting.
10 | Todd Baker | 58 | 10154751259951336_10154751402326336 | This isn't my original post......I just copied it. To spread the word. There is a guy on Twitter who is posting some incredible stuff, mindboggling really. If it's true, it'll bring down the entire Obama administration, if not the entire government. Here goes:Hector Morenco-Soon the world will discover HRC & Obama are at the center of the Syrian conflict, profited from the Clinton foundation, & ignored ISIS.Quatar & Saudis donated to the Clinton foundation while HRC was Sec. State. In exchange for the donations, the CIA was sent to Syria (2011).CIA was behind a staged Arab spring uprising to attempt to topple Assad, because he was blocking the Quatar/Turkey pipeline plan.ISIS formed by accident, and spiraled out of control but also provided cover for the Obama/HRC agenda of laudering bribes for the pipeline.Emails on HRC's private server confirm these tragic events, and Obama & HRC thought they could pardon each other after the election.Little did Obama/HRC realize that an auto-sync feature between Huma & Weiner inadvertently saved the deleted emails on Weiner's machine.Trump in many ways is a sideshow to the brazen criminality & size & scope of the Obama admin & Clinton's corruption enterprise.Russia also cut a deal with Assad to allow an alternative Iran pipeline to go through Syria in exchange for favorable OPEC votes & cash.The cash payments from Iran were actually wealth transfers from Obama>>Iran>>Russia. Obama got pissed that the Iranian money went to Russia.The Democrats were so irritated for being played by the Iranians and Russians that they now want to reignite the cold war against Russia.These bombshells will be confirmed by Wikileaks/Dikileaks soon, but maybe not before the election. The volume of hacked material is massive.If HRC wins then Obama & the Clinton's will pull off the largest heist in the history of the world. That's how important this election is.This high level heist leaving millions dead is also why HRC wants to assassinate Assange & why Obama sent Kerry to Ecuador. Now it's too late.The larger story is how many insiders fighting for a take there are. All of the MSM is getting a piece of the action from Obama/HRC.When Trump talks about "Draining the Swamp" he is right, & has risked his life going against the entire world's corrupt power structure.Please promote this message. I'm working to release source but running out of time. Already spent 300+ hours & won't finish before election.
11 | Brandon Avolin | 39 | 10154751259951336_10154751409851336 | As it would be nice to have HRC indicted on my birthday, I am predicting on Nov 5th 2016, HRC and her entire squad will be indicted on numerous Federal Felonies and Treasonous Acts against the American People and humanity as a whole. She will be also charged with "RICO" and her entire empire will come crashing down! Any bets?
12 | Joel M. Mazel | 67 | 10154751259951336_10154751372941336 | Get out the vote for Trump now until the polls close on Election Day. Let's win by a landslide on Nov. 8. Enough of the corruption, deception, and lies!!
13 | Mario Point | 44 | 10154751259951336_10154751403781336 | Thank you Sheldon!!! We are going to make America Great again. Can't wait until the big polls come out Thursday and shows Trump with a landslide lead. A lot of early voters want to change their vote to Trump.
14 | Jon Roorda | 28 | 10154751259951336_10154751399401336 | While I'm happy this went to Anti Hillary I'm still saddened by the fact that this is what our political system has become, a money laundering mechanism to acquire power and influence
15 | Cristina Walke | 34 | 10154751259951336_10154751420976336 | Trump has been 100% accurate this whole time. He has stated everything that keeps proving Hillary is dangerous for our nation. She also doesn't apologize for any of her actions with the emails. Makes me SO furious.
16 | April Longhurst | 26 | 10154751259951336_10154751386551336 | Trump has spent significantly less then Hillary and he's winning. So tell me how the hell does dumping money at it make a difference unless you're buying votes
17 | Debbie Miracle | 47 | 10154751259951336_10154751414026336 | Trump we likeTry this. I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump. The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want. Trump has so much love in his heart for our country, and the democrats are for themselves only. Look at all he has done to help people and that means so much to me and should mean a lot to everyone. He has a heart and the democrats don't. We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."Like ¬∑ Reply ¬∑ 36 ¬∑ 1 hr

22 | Steve Krauss | 10 | 10154751259951336_680223042154525 | The reaction by Hillary condemning Comey tells you she is worried. It makes Comey's job easier now as he already has more than enough espionage, racketeering and perjury charges to indict. The patriotic Super PACs and other good Americans are going to help inform the low information voters. Trump is going to help us restore America.

Press Secretary Josh Earnest says President Obama's assessment of FBI Director Comey's integrity and character has not changed.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jimmy Christianson | 752 | 10154750603721336_10154751225441336 | Remember when Obama said his administration would be the most transparent in history? Well thanks to Wikileaks's now they are, and now they're all pissed about it, liberal hypocrisy at its finest
2 | Eric Mann | 668 | 10154750603721336_10154751210146336 | We must remove the Democratic establishment and elect Trump. After that, we can deal with the traitors in the Republican party.
3 | Marcus Henderson | 241 | 10154750603721336_10154751213971336 | I remember when Obama said Hillary was unfit for office. Boy he wasn't lying about that was he.lol Americans are fed up with the corruption!!
4 | Mark Amo | 124 | 10154750603721336_10154751244536336 | This is the first time Obama didn't prejudge something. The Beer Summit, Trayvon Martin, Ferguson, MO... the list goes on and you have to wonder what his motivation is this time
5 | Timothy E J Eusini | 124 | 10154750603721336_10154751231486336 | Obama separating from Hillary by way of this statement about Comey, because he's almost an accomplice at this point and needs to separate before the Clinton ship is sunk and he hisself is totally implicated.
6 | Billy Perry | 94 | 10154750603721336_10154751213546336 | The dems are falling apart. All worried about their own selfish legacy turning on each other.
7 | Chad Wynn | 70 | 10154750603721336_10154751210706336 | Just curious.. What happens if Hillary is elected, then is indicted before her or Kaine have been inaugurated, and becomes ineligible to become president...I don't think Kaine would become president because he would never have been inaugurated (not sure). Who would then become president? Barrack Hussein Obama? Could this have been planned all along?
8 | Tammy Benson | 67 | 10154750603721336_10154751222186336 | TRUMP WAS RIGHT AGAIN!!! CORRUPTION! RIGGING OF DEBATES!! CRIMINALS! I'm so sick that people are still supporting this walking embarrassment! She should be in jail! no FEDERAL PRISON!! won't happen because obama knows the blowback will cover him also so he's blocking all attempts to prosecute her!!
9 | Jackie Pettitt | 52 | 10154750603721336_10154751251321336 | This speaks volumes. This is to protect Obama and nothing more. It's a fake investigation. Comey will stall and then come up with some BS conclusion and that will be it. This is the most corrupt administration in a History.
10 | Krista Battey | 36 | 10154750603721336_10154751291016336 | If someone you know is constantly getting into trouble with the police. Constantly being investigated. Has been caught lying over and over, yet every time they're in trouble they claim they are innocent?? Is that someone to entrust with your valuables? Someone you want to run the country? At some point, you have to stop listening to what they are saying and look at what they have been doing to get the truth. If trouble always follows someone.... chances are.....it's them. Let's leave the past behind us. Start a new direction. Vote for Donald Trump!
11 | Pete Iatrou | 14 | 10154750603721336_10154751217416336 | Wow! Only in Washington is the reasoning that if hundreds of people of questionable character and ethics attest to your character, then your character somehow is strong.

14 | Prudence Halbeisen | 14 | 10154750603721336_10154751277906336 | Comey had a moral and legal obligation to inform congress and We the People of the new development. To have waited until later on would been an injustice to the American people and our right to know and be informed.. So if it changes people's voting stance so be it.. Corruption has no place in our  judicial or our American system.. Those who believe it does and practices this type of rhetoric need to be out the door.. and charged for whatever part they have played in it.. be it republican or democrat.
15 | Mary Mealler | 8 | 10154750603721336_677759795720625 | I don't know why I think the Democrats are up to some kind of trickery with this latest FBI email thing. Obama complimenting Comey...something is fishy.

19 | Rich Minser | 3 | 10154750603721336_10154751252336336 | At least President Obama still respects the guy for doing his job. Just wait until we see what the FBI has. It's going to look like Tammany Hall on steroids.

The Sopranos without the class or the charm.Weiner and Lady Weiner, perusing the long list of Clinton helpers cast into flames, no doubt are reviewing witness protection programs.
21 | Michael Condee | 12 | 10154750603721336_10154751224881336 | CRITICAL LIFE LESSON ."Do you know how to catch wild pigs?".There was a chemistry professor in a large college that had some exchange students in the class. One day while the class was in the lab, the professor noticed one young man, an exchange student, who kept rubbing his back and stretching as if his back hurt.The professor asked the young man what was the matter. The student told him he had a bullet lodged in his back. He had been shot while fighting communists in his native country who were trying to overthrow his country's government and install a new communist regime. In the midst of his story, he looked at the professor and asked a strange question. He asked: "Do you know how to catch wild pigs?"The professor thought it was a joke and asked for the punch line. The young man said that it was no joke. "You catch wild pigs by finding a suitable place in the woods and putting corn on the ground. The pigs find it and begin to come every day to eat the free food"."When they are used to coming every day, you put a fence down one side of the place where they are used to coming. When they get used to the fence, they begin to eat the corn again and you put up another side of the fence". "They get used to that and start to eat again.You continue until you have all four sides of the fence up with a gate in the last side". "The pigs, which are used to the free corn, start to come through the gate to eat that free corn again. You then slam the gate on them and catch the whole herd"."Suddenly the wild pigs have lost their freedom. They run around and around inside the fence, but they are caught. Soon they go back to eating the free corn. They are so used to it that they have forgotten how to forage in the woods for themselves, so they accept their captivity."The young man then told the professor that is exactly what he sees happening in America . The government keeps pushing us toward Communism/Socialism and keeps spreading the free corn out in the form of programs such as supplemental income, tax credit for unearned income, tax exemptions, tobacco subsidies, dairy subsidies, payments not to plant crops (CRP), welfare entitlements, medicine, drugs, etc., while we continually lose our freedoms, just a little at a time as the government forces us to participate in many of these programs whether or not we want to.One should always remember two truths: There is no such thing as a free lunch, and you can never hire someone to provide a service for you cheaper than you can do it yourself. If you see that all of this wonderful government "help" is a problem confronting the future of democracy in America, you might want to share this with your friends.  God help us all when the gate slams shut!Quote for today: "The problems we face today are there because the people who work for a living are now outnumbered by those that vote for a living."
22 | Alec Gormley | 4 | 10154750603721336_10154751322771336 | Obama knew what she was doing so he is keeping his mouth shut so it does not get used against him when they all go down.
23 | Jennifer Bufkin Hickson | 7 | 10154750603721336_10154751258646336 | This joke was posted by someone else but I have to share it because it's funny.Hillary Clinton goes to a gifted-student primary school in New York to talk about the world. After her talk, she offers to answer questions from the kids.One little boy puts up his hand. Hillary asks him what his name is."Kenny," he says."And what is your question, Kenny?" she asks."I have three questions," he says. "First -- what happened in Benghazi? "Second -- why would you run for president if you are not capable of handling two e-mail accounts? "Third -- what happened to that six billion dollars that went missing while you were Secretary of State?‚ÄùJust then the bell rings for recess.Hillary tells the students that they will continue after recess. When they resume Hillary says,"Okay, where were we? Oh, that's right, question time. Who has a question?‚ÄùA different boy -- little Johnny -- puts his hand up.Hillary points to him and asks him what his name is."Johnny," he says."What is your question, Johnny?" she asks."I have five questions," he says. "First -- what happened in Benghazi? "Second -- why would you run for president if you are not capable of handling two e-mail accounts? "Third -- whatever happened to that six billion dollars that went missing while you were Secretary of State? "Fourth -- why did the recess bell go off 20 minutes early? "And, fifth -- where's Kenny
24 | Shaleen Theresa Parmenter McLaren | 2 | 10154750603721336_677851692378102 | As I hate corruption. Serious lack of fair reporting. When a president & first lady use Air Force One & tax payers money to canvass for an elected nominee of their choice Do the American people actually accept this & call this democracy. A fair race is exciting & may the best man win. BUT this is an absolute crying shame taking place in the world's supposed to be greatest democracy. Just shows the dirt in politics. This election has truly opened my eyes to the dirt & tricks in politics we cannot even imagine what actually is going on behind the scenes. How in Hillary Clinton's right mind can she point a finger & make a huge performance about what Donald said dragging the first lady into the dirt with her. Can any of you imagine Jackie Kennedy, Nancy Reagan or Laura Bush behaving in the way of Michelle Obama. I am beyond speechless when I know as does the whole world that Bill Clinton had sex in the White House with a young intern & he lied about it "I never had sex with that woman" he could not even be a man & tell the truth. He humiliated his wife Hillary & America in the eyes of the whole world & she has the audacity to point a finger at Donald in tow with Michelle Obama. How low can one actually go. I think these two ladies are very confused about High & Low. My personal opinion I think it would be the greatest day for America if they got a normal passionate citizen with a huge heart for his country & people. Who has put his money where his mouth is. Who has walked the walk & talked the talk. Who has traded with major countries. Who has dealt with people from all walks of life. He has not just sat in a glass house playing with peoples lives. His children are a huge testimony to Donald of the man he really is. Even Hillary acknowledged that. It will be very interesting to see if cheaters do prosper!
25 | Sharon Walters | 7 | 10154750603721336_10154751286171336 | Thanks Wikileaks we now have it in black and white how corrupt this administration and Hillary are. next work on RNC and drain that swamp then maybe we can elect true Americans who care for WE THE PEOPLE

2 | Dilip Kumar | 6482 | 10154750054796336_10154751015286336 | THIS JUST IN!!! Clinton is now leading in the polls in key battleground states such as Qatar, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Syria and hopefully soon San Quentin #MAGA

4 | Billy Felde | 5781 | 10154750054796336_10154751014406336 | What makes Bryan Cranston and these other idiot celebrities think Canada wants them?  Why would Canada want the USA's trash?
5 | Cherie Last Peterson | 2661 | 10154750054796336_10154751010151336 | If only all those who have stated this would really do it, give up their US Citizenship as well, and pay Canadian Taxes on their income!
6 | Sally Cassil | 2391 | 10154750054796336_10154751012071336 | Sadly. not one of the "celebrities" who said they would leave if Bush was re-elected actually did so. This is just another empty gesture.
7 | Kenny Ellerbe | 2095 | 10154750054796336_1585528304806495 | So many people are leaving if Trump gets elected. I'm really excited about that. It's like taking out the trash when you vote!!! Canada will soon know what it feels like to have open borders. I bet they will start building a fence/wall in two years when they see what they're getting. üòÇüòÇ
8 | Mace Boone | 1667 | 10154750054796336_10154751006521336 | Who tf cares actors leaving when trump becomes president.Byeeee Idc lmao

10 | James Allen | 907 | 10154750054796336_968047099966851 | Dear Hollywood celebrities, and Sports celebrities, Liberal Talk show hosts and "Famous Actors,"You exist for MY entertainment. Some of you are great eye candy. Some of you can deliver a line with such conviction that you bring tears to my eyes. Some of you can scare the crap out of me. Others make me laugh. But you all have one thing in common, you only have a place in MY world to entertain me. That‚Äôs it!You make your living PRETENDING to be someone else. Playing dress up like a 6 year old. You live in a make believe world in front of a camera. And often when you are away from one too. Your entire existence depends on MY patronage.Just keep this one thing in your mind; I‚Äôll crank the organ grinder; you dance. When I want or feel like it, you're MY Monkey; I feed you; you don't feed me.
11 | RJ LaGrange | 848 | 10154750054796336_1585526964806629 | Too funny that the United States is good enough to make millions of dollars but as soon as these crybabies don't like something they want to move. This is exactly what we are trying to fix. No more taking advantage of the United States!
12 | Georgia Thibodeau | 366 | 10154750054796336_1585535424805783 | Why is everyone going to Canada and not Mexico. I'll chip in for the flight. If this keeps up, we'll clean out the liberals. Poor Canada. Maybe Canada won't want them.
13 | Mark Alan Hays | 250 | 10154750054796336_968048276633400 | Frankly, no one would miss ANY of the "celebrities" who have vowed to leave the U.S. if Trump is elected.  I do wonder, however, if Cranston is like most of the other "celebs" who threaten to leave would go to Canada?  I haven't heard one of these liberal, sheeple fools say they would move to Mexico!  Wouldn't that fact make them racists?!
14 | Dianne A Troester | 246 | 10154750054796336_1786056854991059 | Yeah that's real patriotic.. everyone who doesn't like the President moves out of country.. Why not remain and try to make things better in YOUR country??  No, just flee cause you can't be bothered fighting for it.
15 | Anthony Vono | 331 | 10154750054796336_10154751003921336 | The Republican leaders that have joined the Democrat band wagon who are complaining about Comeys'' recent move to reopen the case against Hillary Clinton are all part of the same Establishment that want Trump to lose. Uncommitted voters and late deciders, don't be bamboozled
16 | Kara Reece Smith | 204 | 10154750054796336_10154751010286336 | This country would be better off if EVERY Hollywood star would move to Canada. Period.
17 | Holly Burke Raymond | 138 | 10154750054796336_1226822854026677 | Why do these celebrities think the people care if they move out of the country or not? So you end up with dual citizenship...big deal. Maybe you could denounce all the money you make while working in the music/movie industry in United States, if the winner of the election is that big of a disappointment to you. I could give two shits if you move or anyone else for that matter.
18 | Jennie Parr Stoll | 144 | 10154750054796336_1585546078138051 | Trump--already making America great again. Losing one Hollywood wingnut at a time. If you TRULY loved this country, you'd fight for it, regardless of the outcome of the election. But nope, you'll spout your meaningless drivel, and when Trump is elected, you'll backtrack. And how it was all for show. Because the reality is that Canada doesn't want you either. And nowhere else in the world can you live your elitist lifestyle.
19 | Jeremy Barker | 107 | 10154750054796336_1786057504990994 | U can be easily replaced. Ur contributions to society is limited to none. U won't be missed and never had any skill set America actually needed. I wish u the best in your endeavors
20 | Allison Orr | 83 | 10154750054796336_1414528501893802 | As an expat living in the US, I wish people would stop saying "they're moving to Canada". Canada is a great country, not a boobie prize when you don't get your way. I don't like DT, but I am not going back if he wins. I will continue on raising 3 children, being a decent human being and supporting this country, and the people who are running it, as best I can.
21 | Michael Fawley | 78 | 10154750054796336_1255865591122068 | Yet nobody cares and your opinion will motivate no one to change their vote. When will celebrities recognize that they should shut their mouth about politics? You are bound to piss off half the country no matter what side you take and Trump supporters will not forget this. You have just lowered your worth as an actor and we all know you are full of s**t and won't actually leave this great country, best of luck. #Trump16
22 | Robert J. Foster | 56 | 10154750054796336_968044889967072 | Just another Hollywood elitist snob. Nobody will miss you and nobody wants to hear what you have to say. However, Canada doesn't want you. Go to the middle east and enjoy yourself.
23 | Margaret Leahey Bailey | 60 | 10154750054796336_10154751009816336 | I can not stand that woman from NPR Radio that you have on Fox...she is so ANTI TRUMP....Brit Hume, the worst person you have on air, has her on all the time, and she is on tonight with Bret. She has NO BRAINS...only negative opinions.
24 | David Henderson | 46 | 10154750054796336_646503135528739 | Trumps already making America great by causing a liberal stampede of sorry actors for the border, and he's not even in office.Who is Bryan Cranston and why should I care if he stays or goes?
25 | Betty Stanley | 54 | 10154750054796336_968046263300268 | What makes you think Canada wants you and all the others?  I know some they may balk at having them move to their country.  Bryan, go pack because he is going to be the next president.  We do not want a lying, corrupt traitor like Hillary Clinton as our President. if elected she will be impeached when she goes to prison.

2 | Wayne R Johnson | 1802 | 10154750935806336_10154750937166336 | Hillary Clinton conspired with Donna Brazil and by cheating and lying again she proves her dishonesty, lack of integrity, and lack of honor by her willingness to cheat. Since she is incapable of standing for what is right on small issues like debate questions, how can we expect her to stand for American justice as president.Fire Hillary and vote Trump!
3 | Jen Smith | 727 | 10154750935806336_10154750937461336 | You're going down with the ship you created Hillary!! TRUMP 2016!!
4 | Dennis Grzymala | 432 | 10154750935806336_10154750940276336 | You tell um girl. Tell them when cars were made in Flit, MI and you could drink the water. Now the cars are made in Mexico and they can drink the water..Definitely moving toward a 3rd world nation from Clinton, Bush and Obama reigns since the 90s..Vote TRUMP. Address and reverse NAFTA, GATT and TTP. USA 1st. Not Globalism on the nickel of the legal US citizens..
5 | Arthur N Denise Ewing | 406 | 10154750935806336_10154750959101336 | ‚ö†If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ VOTE TRUMP!!!

Keep drinking the Hillary's poison being served ..You don't give a care about our Nation's security and your families safety and future with this Slithering Snake in office !!! Spews Venom just like Jim Jones served up the poison , Stupids Drank it !!!! H ROTTEN C is the Bride of Satan 100 %
7 | Lex K Morse | 176 | 10154750935806336_10154750946801336 | She is pathetic! She has given our enemies our secrets and our uranium, any far left loon votes for her, move to North Korea!
8 | Santi Serra | 106 | 10154750935806336_705647899590996 | This woman is shameless and really embodies how she thinks she is over the law. Any other candidates would have been pushed off to the side. Hillary Clinton you are despicable, crooked, corrupt, liar and worst ever this country have ever seen who is running for Presidency.
9 | Shayne Sullivan | 108 | 10154750935806336_10154750940436336 | To begin, one of the first things the email release highlights is that back in July, Huma Abedin testified in a deposition where she indicated that Hillary Clinton destroyed a ton of her schedules when she was Secretary of State.Ask yourself, why would Hillary Clinton put hundreds of her own travel logs in a burn bag to have destroyed? The deposition also reveals that Abedin was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù with a sensitivedocument, emailing another aide to let her know Clinton‚Äôs schedule was left sitting on a bed in an unlocked hotel room. They obviously do not care about keeping our secrets protected or they wouldn‚Äôt continue to be so careless.To make matters even worse, WikiLeaks reveals that Huma Abedin had access to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Secretary of State email address that wasn‚Äôt secured. Clinton often needed naps and clearly has a mental health issue, so she allowed Huma to use her email server to send replies and read what was coming through. To be clear, Huma did NOT have the clearance to operate under this capacity.
10 | Charles Dickerson | 89 | 10154750935806336_1831172717117660 | I can't believe we have that many stupid people in Cincinnati, backing someone who should already be in prison. Two laws they know she has already broken you can't hold public office !! What a waste of time on a woman that is a crook !!
11 | Mike Broemsen | 78 | 10154750935806336_1831173267117605 | DNC Chairwomen Debbie Wasserman Shulz Fired because of corruption... Replacement DNC Chairwomen Donna Brazile Fired by CNN for Violating debate rules ... Corruption for the Dems runs deep folks. All you have to do is look at who's leading them...
12 | Greg Berry | 47 | 10154750935806336_705648159590970 | Trump hasn't been an employee of ours....she has been...to think that she deserves a promotion to the top position is just ignorant and stupid....she should have been on unemployment years ago!
13 | Kara Anne McCroskey | 47 | 10154750935806336_1831177777117154 | I just can't believe that people will actually vote for this woman, I had higher hopes for the American people, stupid me. I am a woman and she is an embarrassment. Of all the woman who are better suited for the job this is the one that was chosen. I would never vote for her even if my life depended on it. She is not what America or the world needs. She is unfit to even be in any government position. She's not even fit to be a school janitor.
14 | Katie Scala | 61 | 10154750935806336_705663242922795 | Disgusting, but Ohio is going to vote Trump. I see thousands of Donald trump signs everywhere and virtually no Hillary signs üíØüëè
15 | Jeff Mcdonough | 60 | 10154750935806336_10154750950791336 | Hillary Clinton is the scum of the earth. She is sitting back with her buddies Obama, Soros, and Satan and watching the world burn.She will say and do anything to get what she wants, and all the sheep behind her will follow! She is ALL that is wrong with the Political system and for anyone to support her after all she has done and said are mentally deficient.Why are we rewarding lawlessness and incompetence? Obama was re-elected despite constantly getting our troops killed, his incredibly low labor usage, declining wage growth, and skyrocketing health care costs. He made it his mission to provide ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù care with the ACA, yet my rates doubled up to $500/month (compare this with my ever decreasing car insurance rates‚Ä¶ only $25/month from Insurance Panda now). Yet we voted him in for 8 years? And we want to elect Hillary? I ask this question in all sincerity and not as a hostile commentary:Does there exist, anywhere on this planet, a more disgusting, vile, and reprehensible woman, both inside and out, than Hillary Rodham Clinton?
16 | Don Persichitte | 38 | 10154750935806336_10154750957811336 | We all knew, well, most of us knew that Obama was corrupt before he got elected, but never before has there been a candidate with so much documented corruption as there is with Hillary Clinton.
17 | Sara Soucie | 52 | 10154750935806336_10154750944871336 | You stole the town hall debate from Bernie by getting the questions ahead of time from Donna Brazile.Get on your knees and ask for forgiveness you wicked witch.
18 | Mary Lessard | 38 | 10154750935806336_705650659590720 | Hillary Clinton is a narcissistic pathological liar that put our national security at risk. She was in on selling uranium to Russia and tells the entire world the launch time for a nuclear weapon.
19 | Jolene McKeefry-Santy | 40 | 10154750935806336_10154750951616336 | Blah blah blah blah... just like any politician they say what you want to hear. I can't even stand listening when she opens her mouth. She did this to herself of the lies....
20 | Michael Gehring | 31 | 10154750935806336_1874829919415428 | Nice job Hillary. Let's fly in on Halloween, shut down Interstate 275 at 5:00 when we're trying to get our kids home to Trick or Treat. Who does a rally on Halloween?  Ohhhh.... a witch! üòÜ
21 | Dusty Nickle | 20 | 10154750935806336_10154750960221336 | So far I've only seen negative views on this event and her words. Is there anything she won't say? She's going to lead us into WWIII and no one cares.
22 | Kelly Murray Smith | 33 | 10154750935806336_10154750943511336 | Same old worn out record of lies! Put her on the stage and flip her switch and thats what you get!Remember Benghazi just another one on a long list only this one cost innocent lives!Post by Stanley c Smith
23 | Linda Burchette | 17 | 10154750935806336_1831177650450500 | She was disgusting and desperate today inciting fear in naive college students that Trump could not be trusted to control the nuclear bomb! This was disturbing to watch! Vote America! to end Clinton corruption!!!!!!!
24 | Bill Brewer Jr. | 17 | 10154750935806336_705658329589953 | Why isn't Hilary taking about this? Kathleen Saucier: Why is my son in prison for mishandling classified information while Hillary Clinton, who's done much worse, is running for President?
25 | Laura L Luczak | 27 | 10154750935806336_10154750938296336 | WHAT A JOKE !!! why don't you all wait until it all comes out to make sure everything is the truth!!! ..... plus it doesn't really matter because they ''both'' SUCK in their own way !! yes both!! Trump is no better because he has his own skeletons coming out in this too !! Wake up America :( Trump has upcoming FRAUD and child RAPE in Nov,- Dec.Trump tried to do business in Cuba during an embargo. Trump used his charity's money to buy a portrait of himself and pay fines. Trump lied about donating to veterans and 9/11 charities. Trump stiffed sub-contractors out of payment. Trump used illegal Polish immigrants to build Trump Tower. Trump was sued for not renting to black people. Trump "Donated" $25,000 to Florida's Attorney General causing her to drop the investigation into Trump University.Trump bragged about sexual assault. Trump left the State of NJ with an unpaid $25 million tax bill. Trump was found guilty of creating a fake anti-gambling front organization to slander Native American casino competition. Trump hasn't paid Tax in what 18 years ?Show us your papers !!!!!!And let's not forget about any ''Race'' that's not White with him... WOWTrump has been repeatedly fined for breaking rules related to his operation of casinos. Trump was fined $750,000 by the FTC for failing to disclose his purchases of stock in two companies.AND SO MUCH MORE !**Over 4 thousand lawsuits and many more atrocious things he has done and said in the past & '''recent''' years is just as disgusting** The hypocrisy of Trump supporters is too funny and too sad at the same time. (and let's pat some of our family on their butts too...lol gross) IF any of this is true -or- false it can also be said of Clinton too, Don't believe everything without proof !!:(

5 | Cathy DiGeorge-Rushing | 123 | 10154750396556336_1025039560940625 | If for no other reason than her actions regarding Benghazi, Clinton should be disqualified from running for anything other than rat monitor at the Federal pen!
6 | Brandi Norris Peterson | 73 | 10154750396556336_1772632419660304 | I truly think obama wants Hillary to lose because that way he can blame everything he's messed up the last 8 years (the horrific economy and healthcare system, etc.) on a Republican.

At a campaign event on Monday, Hillary Clinton spoke about the FBI reopening the investigation into her private email server and said, "There is no case here."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Robert Anthony | 5480 | 10154750454846336_10154750515766336 | In the year 2000 I had the privilege of working on Mr. Trump‚Äôs security staff in the Trump Tower. Let me just say that he is a real man, a real boss, and a real caring and loving person.He and his personal bodyguard Matt Calamari (now Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice-President) treated us like family and when we came into contact with Mr. Trump we addressed him as Mr. Trump, or Sir, not because it was something we were told to do, but rather out of respect. I hold Mr Trump in the highest regard.On 9/13/2001 I was walking out of the pile of concrete, steel, glass, and human debris that was Ground Zero as Mr. Trump was walking in. I think he was with Kevin or Brian (bodyguards), not sure which, but I addressed Mr. Trump and gave him a few breathing masks, then exited the site. This was months after I left the TRUMP organization for family issues.No more then one hour later I was receiving calls from Trump Tower stating that Mr. Trump was very proud to see me lending a hand to help our people and that they would like me to come back to work in the TRUMP organization.This is personal for me, and as a 100% disabled veteran fighting medical bills that the VA refuses to pay I know I need a man like Mr. Trump to stick up for people like me and for the rest of our great nation.God Bless Mr. Trump and God Bless America!‚Äù
2 | John McAuliffe | 3183 | 10154750454846336_10154750508671336 | Let the investigation tell us that. I'm sure Hillary, a former lawyer, will understand if we don't just take her word for it
3 | Andrew Tucker | 1246 | 10154750454846336_10154750513921336 | Just like there wasn't an embassy in Benghazi. She cannot recognize a disaster when it's right in front of her and enveloping her.
4 | Amir Parvez | 1152 | 10154750454846336_10154750509856336 | Hillary Clinton is a threat to American Democracy (what's left of it) and world peace. A vote for her is a vote for worldwide economic slavery and evil, endless war! She's a corrupt, evil, lying warmonger who already has blood on her hands of thousands of people and millions of dollars of blood money in the Clinton Foundation. #NeverHillary
5 | Carlhens Baptiste | 749 | 10154750454846336_10154750511521336 | I bet the FBI and the American people beg to differ. I mean I didn't expect her to say anything other than that. Obviously.
6 | John Noh | 628 | 10154750454846336_10154750525171336 | It was not a mistake, Mrs. Clinton. You had every intention of creating the server to hide whatever you were scheming from seeing the light of day. A mistake would be sending an email from the wrong account because the email client auto-corrected to the last one used.
7 | Vicki Dean | 413 | 10154750454846336_10154750516806336 | I am sure hillary has no idea what huma and/or weiner had in that folder "Life Insurance" - I am also sure it was there to protect them from her and has to be damning enough to keep them alive....
8 | James P Heidl | 339 | 10154750454846336_10154750518251336 | How can Democrats be so delusional it just baffles my mind to look at the evidence before you hit this woman terrible Behavior and not understand what she's about she didn't make a mistake how does educated smartest woman in the world make a mistake by using an illegal server when it's just unbelievable
9 | Julia Beckman Rickett | 300 | 10154750454846336_10154750515421336 | it wan't a mistake, it was an intentional act. You who worked on the watergate case thought if you could delete all the evidence (unlike Nixon), you'd never have to answer for your crimes
10 | Leanne Belk | 262 | 10154750454846336_1096459100390605 | I just love Hillary's response, as well as others supporting her, to how wrong it is for the FBI to come forward and accuse her of wrong doings with no proof other than his words...BUT...when they brought several women forward accusing Trump of wrong doing with no proof...that seemed to be just fine! Although I trust Comey a little more than the women who have yet to start any lawsuits against him. If you dish it, you better be able to take it!
11 | Stacy Cox | 193 | 10154750454846336_10154750526341336 | It's not a mistake, it's a crime. Are you really this stupid or just pretending to be a total IDIOT?. You cannot be trusted. You cannot work for us. We have returned your resume with a letter to inform you we have chosen a different applicant that Better fits our requirements. Thank you for applying.
12 | Diane Bowman | 158 | 10154750454846336_10154750522996336 | I've always called the Clinton's Teflon, that nothing ever sticks...But then there comes a time when even the best Teflon skillet gets burned and no longer works...hoping this is enough fire to ruin that coating and expose the truth.
13 | James Semler | 120 | 10154750454846336_1837891943122300 | Dear Hillary Clinton,You're panicking. You're also very very stupid. You brought this all on yourself. The FBI wouldn't reopen your email case if they didn't have anything. Accept defeat and die a slow miserable painful death. America will be better off without you. Sincerely, The Awaken American Public
14 | Mike Camire | 124 | 10154750454846336_10154750521396336 | She is similar to OJ, he didn't pay for his murder but his past finally caught up with him, just like the 30 years of corruption has finally caught up with her. #DrainTheSwamp  #HillaryForPrison
15 | Vicki R Krout Cope | 90 | 10154750454846336_10154750528846336 | I'm shocked and disgusted that there are people still following her to these events, then I reminded myself of the fact that jellyfish survived for 650 million years despite not having brains gives hope to these people.
16 | Toni Smith | 75 | 10154750454846336_1837882866456541 | The evidence of her negligence in this email case is overwhelming. She should have been arrested and charged the first time. You don't need immunity or need to destroy evidence and lie about it numerous times if you haven't done anything wrong. The mafia can't hold a candle to Bill and Hillary Clinton. They both are the epitome of corruption and deceit.
17 | Danny Cole | 53 | 10154750454846336_1837884483123046 | Ah killary:1. You were fired from watergate for lying2. You are a protege of Sal Alinski3. You defended, freed, laughed and bragged (it's on tape) about the child rapist you got off. He raped a 12 year old girl so badly she was in a comma for 5 days, had wall to wall genital stitches, and can never have children. You stated in court that the little girl fantasizes about older men.4. You defended your rapist husband then diligently worked to slander his victims5. You did nothing to help the poor soldiers and ambassador in Benghazzi. You sent no help, even though you knew it was a military attack by alqueda.6. You have taken at least $25 million from Saudi Arabia, and who knows how much from Qatar. The two places that completely use and abuse women and children. They also support terrorists. 7. Your wonderful lesbian lover Abedin put all kinds of "life insurance" emails on her pedophile husbands laptop, so she and he could black mail you later for it.You deleted 33k emails and skated free while Martha Stewart went to jail for far less.8. You stole the election from Bernie Sanders in a rigged primary election.9. You slandered, lied, and tried to destroy Donald J. Trump with false accusations that your own husband has been doing for decades.10. You are the biggest, most vile, most disgusting, evil, pig of a human that has ever walked this Earth. You make Obama look like the best president ever even though, he is in fact, the worst president we have ever had.Nothing, not even a a Tsunami can keep me from voting for Trump on Nov. 8.#neverhillary#forevertrumpI have never been a religious person but on nov 8, after I vote, I'm going to fast and pray all day long in hopes that god will not let hitlery become president!
18 | Matthew Bryant | 49 | 10154750454846336_1156509797765361 | The only way that video would be better is if she slammed her fist and said "I did not have email relations with that woman...Miss Abedin."
19 | Michael Kenitzer | 70 | 10154750454846336_10154750525381336 | "Attention idiotic lemmings, I mean My Voters hurry and vote for me before they show you even more of my corruption"- Hillary Clintonsubtitle of her speech
20 | Bernie Paramore | 60 | 10154750454846336_10154750527931336 | The only difference is this time, after comey caved into you and obama and saw his reputation destroyed, I believe he will do what he should have done the first time and that is to prosecute. If lynch tries to interfere for obama there will be dire consequences for his whole criminal corrupt administration including him.
21 | Chantel Hughes | 57 | 10154750454846336_10154750519966336 | Thanks Hill, I'm sure everyone feels much better now üôÑ There was a case and still is a case, you put Americans at risk for your pay for play. Please don't tell us there is "no case".
22 | Ian Michael Renwick | 82 | 10154750454846336_10154750515851336 | Of course it was a mistake, as she admits, but she wants to be spared from the consequences of her mistake. She reflects exactly what is wrong with this society.
23 | Carol Rucker | 50 | 10154750454846336_1799011837012981 | I beg to differ with you dahlink!!! Obviously they wouldnt have gone this far doing this without ammunition!!!!! Time to drain the swamp!!!! BTW were is your USA pin? Ahhh well for good reason you arent for the USA your for yourself like you have been for the last 30 yrs!!!!!!!!!
24 | Maya Shusterman | 32 | 10154750454846336_1096463473723501 | There was a case and there is a case! If Hillary still has a smidgen of decency left she will admit the truth to everything she had done wrong and fold her campaign effective immediately! If there is still that smidgen of decency with all she has done and all the legal issues she is still facing, she needs to have the curtesy not to cause anymore disarray on the American people and step down.
25 | Tony Gatas | 47 | 10154750454846336_1837882173123277 | I can't believe how many woman where asked why are you Voting for Hillary and the response was,because she is a woman! Then they asked name something she has done for the American people, not one person could answer that question. Just shows you how stupid these supporters are.
