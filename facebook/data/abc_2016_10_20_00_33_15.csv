After Hillary Clinton said Russian Pres. Putin would 'rather have a puppet as president,' Donald J. Trump shot back: "You're the puppet." http://abcn.ws/2dQ4apU
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Delmer Rodriguez | 10154918482508812_10154918486923812 | Trump completely collapsed in each of the three presidential debates. Hilary did not have to do much because the Donald was a self-destructing time bomb the whole time. Trump lost by a lot in all debates. Those who say otherwise and blame the 'media' instead have their heads in the sand.
2 | Clint J. Everest | 10154918482508812_10154918499868812 | Hopefully after Hillary wins the election in a couple weeks, Trump and the remaining republicans can get the help they desperately need.  Many people are saying this.  Very sad.
3 | Donald Oula | 10154918482508812_10154918491173812 | For heaven's sake why would Putin support trump and even threaten to declare world war three? Isn't he a puppet? ..all the voters knows that
4 | Linda Salazar | 10154918482508812_10154918515448812 | Folks I think we are being blinded by trickery!! This stuff with Donald Trump is blinding us to what is going on in the USA with Russia. Putin and Obama are at odds. We DO NOT have bomb shelters. Russia does. Keep your eyes on the true picture. If we have an all out war with Russia you better believe there will be a draft. These young men under 26 will be called up.
5 | Andrew Noseworthy | 10154918482508812_10154918506488812 | If they ever do a live action movie about the puppet Pinocchio in his later years, Trump is gonna get the call from the director. He's a natural. And they'll save money on the makeup. Just gotta get the CGI team working on the nose job. No need to rig the Oscars, the statue is his.
6 | Alice Sell | 10154918482508812_10154918514428812 | Such an immature and pathetic human being. So ill-prepared to do anything except look after himself. He lies about his lies. It's jus so unfathomable how anyone can be for this despicable low life.
7 | William McMillen | 10154918482508812_10154918488743812 | TRUMP officially lost the election with his TREMENDOUS performance tonight....... what a FRUIT LOOP!!

She turned over 20% of US uranium to Russia, they can nuke us with our own uranium because of her greed. They invaded Crimea on her watch. They're a heavy influence in the middle east because of her, the Iran deal made it possible for Russia to sell our uranium to Iran!! Gave Iran 1.7 billion dollars to buy our uranium from Russia.
12 | Sharon Cornett Buehner | 10154918482508812_10154918500548812 | she is bought and paid for..there is not enough money behind Trump to get this....this crooked web is to big...we are a lost country..sold off to the highest donor
13 | Aaron Thiel | 10154918482508812_10154918488763812 | Hillary turned into a stuttering mess that couldn't control the volume of her voice. Could you imagine her negotiating with a hostile Putin with WWIII hanging in the balance? Hillary is in over her head and she knows it. This isn't the peaceful world her husband seen during his presidency and it scares the crap out of her.
14 | Eddie Kostlevy | 10154918482508812_10154918502983812 | Hillary is a world class fool sorry to say.Trump should have pointed out why do you put up a big grin when your caught in a lie.All those sanctions on Russia have done nothing.Russia is tight with Iran way more than we are.Putin likes america and wants to work with us and our stupid leaders don't get it.Yes Assad may be bad but the alternative may be a lot worse.Assad is alligned with Iran too.So whose the Dummy Hillary.

18 | Gloria Netto | 10154918482508812_10154918506613812 | Yes I have said that years she's been in Site House so even her wearing white doesn't cover up all her sins she hides or has done like killing babies is evil
19 | LukeandKristina Armstrong | 10154918482508812_10154918531813812 | There are millions of families out there that would love to have children, but cannot. Since Hillary is for third-trimester abortions then she should have to sit through one.
20 | Gregory Vance | 10154918482508812_10154918498228812 | Chris Wallace asked about HRC open borders speech to donors, she said if he went on to read the email, she was talking about energy.HRC straight up admitted that the wikileaks #PodestaEmails are legitimate.Apparently these #PodestaEmails leaks are just getting started.I wonder what else we'll find?
21 | Russell Friscia | 10154918482508812_10154918506928812 | Clinton offers a mocking smile to almost everything Trump says. That's her attitude toward about one-half of the population-- mockery. You know, toward the "deplorables." And then she says that she's "reaching out to all Americans." Yeah, right.
22 | Barbara Hamel | 10154918482508812_10154918489723812 | Hahaha, it reminded me of the old school yard banter of.... I know you are, but what am I ..... more whining....

25 | Lynn Helms Runnion | 10154918482508812_10154918500573812 | Yes, we can agree that Russia hacked to get the information.  BUT, GUESS WHAT, they hacked the DNC and Hillary's illegal server that had classified information on it, that was illegal to have and that she lied about.  So I ask, "what difference does it make" who hacked it?? At least we are finding out what a corrupt liar she is and how the politicians are manipulating us and OUR government!!!!

7 | Cindy Sargent | 10154918440913812_10154918468773812 | A story by Oliver North, he knew the Clintons too...Do you remember 1987 when the Senators were giving Ollie North such a bad time? This brings it all into perspective, thought you might be interested in this forgotten bit of information.It was 1987! At a lecture the other day they were playing an old news video of Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during the Reagan Administration. There was Ollie in front of God and country getting the third degree, but what he said was stunning!He was being drilled by a senator,"did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security system?"Ollie replied, "yes Sir, I did".The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, "Isn't that just a little excessive?""No sir" continued Ollie."No, and why not?" the senator asked."Because the lives of my family and I were threatened sir"."Threatened? By whom?" the senator questioned."By a Muslim terrorist sir". Ollie answer."Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?""His name is Osama bin Laden, sir", Ollie replied.At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued. "Why are you so afraid of this man?", the senator asked."Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of", Ollie answered, "And the Muslims are trying to take over America and destroy it from the inside out and putting their people into our political offices."And what do you recommend we do about him?", asked the senator."Well, sir, if it was up to me, I would recommend that an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth."The senator disagreed with this approach, and that was all that was shown of the clip. By the way, that senator was Al Gore! Also: Terrorist pilot Mohammad Atta blew up a bus in Israel in 1986. The Israelis captured,tried and imprisoned him. As part of the Oslo agreement with the Palestinians in 1993, Israel had to agree to release so-called, "political prisoners". However, the Israelis would not release any with blood on their hands.The American President at the time, Bill Clinton, and his Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, insisted that all prisoners be released. Thus Mohammad Atta was freed and eventually thanked us by flying an airplane into Tower One of the World Trade Center. This was reported by many of the non-American TV networks at the time that the terrorists were first identified. It was censored in the US from all, pass this on!

16 | China Harris | 10154918440913812_10154918489303812 | A PLAN TO SAVE OUR NATION!!!SHARE!!!!!!!My fellow Americans, A majority of our citizens believe that our nation is doomed because we will elect a President that can not be trusted or a President that will divide our nation with hateful rhetoric and actions.We have a plan that will SAVE our nation, and it is going to take us coming together to do it. I am asking you to read our strategy very carefully because I am going to need your help. Here are the steps we need to take together.STEP #1On November 8, it is our goal to keep Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump from winning 270+ electoral votes.There are eight states that will allow a WRITE-IN Presidential Candidate, and I am asking the people in the following States to WRITE - IN my name:"ROBBY WELLS"Oregon, Wyoming, Iowa, Alabama, Delaware, New Jersey, Vermont, and New Hampshire.If you have friends and family in these eight states, I am asking you to share this strategy with them. Everyone must know our plan, and everyone must come together to implement this plan.STEP #2By winning several states as a WRITE-IN, we will ensure that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will not gain over 270 electoral votes. STEP #3Once all the votes are tallied, and no candidate receives over 270 electoral votes, the sitting Congress will take the top three electoral vote getters (Clinton, Trump, and Robby Wells) and vote to decide who the 45th President will be.STEP #4*The majority of Congress is Republican, which means Mrs. Clinton, who is a Left leaning Democrat, will most likely be defeated.*There will be no Democrats, and close to 70% of Republican Congressmen that will not vote for Mr. Trump, who is a Right leaning Republican, which means he will also be defeated. *That means that we can win this election as an Independent that sits in the Middle, taking the absolute best from the Left Wing and Right Wing, with a plan to restore Prosperity so that every citizen will have a chance at the American Dream. I believe our nation is about to see it's finest hour, and we are going to save our nation.WRITE-IN "ROBBY WELLS" for PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!!!robbywells2016.com#RiseUp #RiseUpAmerica #NewBreed #RobbyWells4President#WeAreGoingToDoIt #WriteInRobbyWells

1 | Kelly Oubre | 10154918422888812_10154918531383812 | So, She wants to raise taxes so they can replenish Social Security.  Money they shouldn't be helping themselves to anyway.   Why should they take more money from us, in taxes, to give back to us... She wants to making us... pay ourselves back.  In reality... they treat our Social Security as their own personal piggy bank... it would just be money for them to help themselves to in the long run.
2 | Sharon Exendine Swon | 10154918422888812_10154918535663812 | Trump has obviously spent his life saying whatever pops onto his mind and being surrounded by yes men, no one to question or challenge him.

5 | Mariana González Cedraro | 10154918422888812_10154918471643812 | Since Donald asked: What has Hillary achieved in her 30years public service life? Here is a summary since her youth. AS LAW STUDENT:- She took a summer internship interviewing workers in migrant camps for Senator Walter Mondale’s subcommittee.- She also begun working in the Yale New Haven Hospital to develop procedures to handle suspected child abuse cases.- She got so involved in children’s issues that she actually took an extra year in law school working at the child studies center to learn what more could be done to improve the lives and the futures of poor children.- In the summer of 1972, she went to Dothan, Alabama to visit one of those segregated academies that then enrolled over half-a-million white kids in the South. The only way the economics worked is if they claimed federal tax exemptions to which they were not legally entitled. She got sent to prove they weren’t.- Then she went down to south Texas where she work withl union leader Franklin Garcia, and he helped her register Mexican-American voters.-  In her last year in law school, Hillary kept up this work. She went to South Carolina to see why so many young African- American boys, I mean, young teenagers, were being jailed for years with adults in men’s prisons. And she filed a report on that, which led to some changes, too.-  After Yale, Hillary moved to Massachusetts to keep working on children’s issues. This time trying to figure out why so many kids counted in the Census weren’t enrolled in school, she did research with families with children with disabilities, and filed a report that helped influence ultimately the Congress to adopt the proposition that children with disabilities, physical or otherwise, should have equal access to public educationDURING HER TIME IN ARKANSAS- She  started the first legal aid clinic in northwest Arkansas, providing legal aid services to poor people who couldn’t pay for them.- In Arkansas, she joined the oldest law firm west of the Mississippi. Soon after, she started a group called the Arkansas Advocates for Families and Children.-  In 1979, just after Bill became governor, Hillary chair a rural health committee to help expand health care to isolated farm and mountain areas. They recommended to do that partly by deploying trained nurse practitioners in places with no doctors to provide primary care they were trained to provide. It was a big deal then, highly controversial and very important.-  In 1983, Hillary chaired a committee to recommend new education standards for Arkansas as a part of and in response to a court order to equalize school funding and a report by a national expert that said our woefully underfunded schools were the worst in America… Well, by the time Bill ran for president nine years later, the same expert who said that we had the worst schools in America (before Bill term) said that Arkansas was one of the two most improved states in America. And that’s because of those standards that Hillary developed. - Hillary researched and lead the implementation of a preschool program developed in Israel to teach low-income parents, even those that couldn’t read, to be their children’s first teachers…-  She lead an effort to pass a health care reform bill, that was obstructed by Republicans during Bill presidency. After the failure, Hillary immediately went to work on solving the problems the bill sought to address one by one. The most important goal was to get more children with health insurance. In 1997, Congress passed the Children’s Health Insurance Program, still an important part of President Obama’s Affordable Care Act. It insures more than 8 million kids.-   In 1997, she also teamed with the House Minority Leader Tom DeLay, who maybe disliked Democrats more than any of Newt Gingrich’s crowd. They worked on a bill together to increase adoptions of children under foster care. Now, the bill they worked on, which passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority, led to a big increase in the adoption of children out of foster care, including non-infant kids and special-needs kids.AS A SENATOR-  Her early years [as a senator from New York] were dominated by 9/11, by working to fund the recovery, then monitoring the health and providing compensation to victims and first and second responders. -   In 2003, partly spurred on by what NY was going through, she became the first senator in the history of New York ever to serve on the Armed Services Committee. So she tried to make sure people on the battlefield had proper equipment. She tried to expand and did expand health care coverage to Reservists and members of the National Guard. She got longer family leave, working with Senator Dodd, for people caring for wounded service members.-And she worked for more extensive care for people with traumatic brain injury. She also served on a special Pentagon commission to propose changes necessary to meet our new security challenges. Newt Gingrich was on that commission, he even said what a good job she had done.- She voted against Bush's tax cuts, which have increased federal deficits immensely.- Hillary supported immigration reform as a senator.- Hillary led a bipartisan effort to bring broadband access to rural communities.AS SECRETARY OF STATE- As secretary of state, she worked hard to get strong sanctions against Iran’s nuclear program. And in what The Wall Street Journal no less called a half-court shot at the buzzer, she got Russia and China to support them. Her team negotiated the New START Treaty with Russia to reduce nuclear weapons and reestablish inspections. And she got enough Republican support to get two-thirds of the Senate, the vote necessary to ratify the treaty.- She conducted many diplomatic missions and visited over 100 countries, more than any previous Secretary of State. She did a great deal to repair international relations after damage caused by the unilateral approaches taken by the Bush administration.- She flew all night long from Cambodia to the Middle East to get a cease-fire that would avoid a full-out shooting war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza to protect the peace of the region.-   She negotiated the first agreement ever — ever — where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions.-   She tripled the number of people with AIDS in poor countries whose lives are being saved with your tax dollars, most of them in Africa, going from 1.7 million lives to 5.1 million lives and it didn’t cost you any more money. She just bought available FDA-approved generic drugs, something we need to do for the American people more.- She visited more countries that any other secretary of state in history.Was a major proponent of sensible diplomacy which brought about a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, and brokered human rights with Burma.-Oversaw free trade agreements with our allies such as Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.-She initiated reforms in the State Department, including the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review which established a review process to increase the effectiveness of the department.- She was vital in conducting relations with Pakistan and Afghanistan.-Hillary worked to restart negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, establishing direct talks in 2010 and traveling to Jerusalem in 2012 in an effort to stop the 2012 Gaza conflict.- As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton promoted women's right and human rights as vital to U.S. political interests. She advocated for gay rights at the UN Human Rights Council.There is more, google it ;) (sorry for the length! )

Worldwide opinion, including Indian viewers, is that Trump has won. He called Hillary, ' a nasty woman, and refused to accept the imaginary election result of his enemies, thereby giving the hint he will win. , 52% CNN staff would have voted for Hillary, but 80% of independent viewers have voted for Trump.
7 | Rob Fritzenkotter | 10154918422888812_10154918481908812 | Go to moveon.org. That's the little socialist website with negative Trump talking points, where the little maniacs plot their agitations. While Clinton focuses on sex and racism claims about her opponent, she calls that 'taking the high road.' Right... And, the TV media are complicit with her power goals. The media is lying - they are telling the American Public that Wikileaks is a "RUSSIAN HACKER." Wikileaks is an international organization that exposes political criminals and they are exposing Clinton by making her emails public. The media is actively fooling the public with their red herring.

Donald J. Trump said Tuesday the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct in recent days are looking for their "10 minutes of fame." #Debates
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kilikina Christine Jung | 10154918409253812_10154918423343812 | The question is "Why are these women just now coming out of the woodwork making these accusations?" Very odd they don't come out until he's running for president.
2 | T Elliott Cato | 10154918409253812_10154918423668812 | Attention Visitors: The Trumpanzees are currently in the midst of one of their frequent poo flinging fests.

3 | Michael Roe | 10154918409253812_10154918413318812 | Why is no one talking about the videos of Hillarys staff causing the violence at the trump rally's!
4 | Gabriel Gamez | 10154918409253812_10154918513843812 | First of all those women's need to come a little early you know how it an accused cause a lot of women came out of nowhere  saying all this bs so that y they are liar any woman could say that and I mean anyone so don't buy any of these women crap stuff it just in the book what that word scums of the earth
5 | Kari Rose Polman | 10154918409253812_10154918419703812 | Trump is a jerk that treats women like trash! He doesn't deserve to be president!
6 | Abdier De Jesus | 10154918409253812_10154918415413812 | Its amazing how almost all media is controlled by clinton..they are trying hard to manipulate and control the the voters mind with their fake propaganda..Cnn=clinton news network,abc,nbc,cbs,yahoo news ext..they do think they can control the mass population as Laboratory rats..
7 | William McMillen | 10154918409253812_10154918444343812 | TRUMP officially lost the election with his TREMENDOUS performance tonight....... what a FRUIT LOOP!!
8 | Boy Zumba | 10154918409253812_10154918418408812 | Hillary's lies and the Emails shows the length they are willing to go..Sad day for DNC

10 | Mike Wagner | 10154918409253812_10154918420748812 | "What do you mean I lost the debate? Where did you hear that? What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!" - Donald Trump
11 | Bruce Bullito | 10154918409253812_10154918413403812 | There is no doubt Donald nailed this one for sure. A general was convicted of email fraud and this reject gets a pass. The system is rigged for sure.
12 | Catherine Miron Youngstrom | 10154918409253812_10154918432143812 | Disgusting pig man. How would it be if anyone treated Ivanka or Tiffany in that manner?
13 | Jennie Gaun | 10154918409253812_10154918481083812 | 10 minutes of fame? Wouldn't it be 10 years of shame to be known as one of the many Trump, allegedly, assaulted?
14 | Bruno Bean Novak | 10154918409253812_10154918417753812 | You don't have to choose between Bill's biggest enabler and Hillary. Vote Gary JohnsonBTW before you mention Aleppo read below. Hillary,"we were under sniper fire"Hillary,"we left the Whitehouse dead broke"Hillary,"I was instrumental in the Irish peace process"Hillary,"A hateful video caused Benghazi"Hillary replied “I don’t know” a whopping 327 TIMES during her e-mail investigation. After SMASHING 13 iPads and iPhones!Hillary," We all knew he was guilty as hell *laughs*" -when talking about a child molester she defended and won for Hillary, “floozy,” “bimbo” and “stalker,”effort to cast doubt on the Bill's accusers. Wolff: “And Brexit? Your position?” Trump: “Huh?” Wolff: “Brexit.” Trump: “Hmm.” Wolff: “The Brits leaving the EU.” Trump,"I remember watching the firefighters on 7/11"Trump,"I will defend article 11 of the constitution!"Trump,"I don't know why there are 13 stripes on the flag"Trump thought Quds=KurdsTrump,"I don't think my daughter Ivanka would pose for playboy, although she does have a very nice figure, I've said if Ivanka weren't my daughter perhaps I'd be dating her"Trump about a married woman:"Yeah, that’s her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything." "Grab ’em by the p***y. You can do anything."
15 | Rachel Bush D'Onofrio | 10154918409253812_10154918423283812 | And your point is? It was all orchestrated by her campaign. Lies.
16 | GiGi Bradley | 10154918409253812_10154918434358812 | I was wondering about these women too... and I don't like Trump.
17 | Brandon Busbee | 10154918409253812_10154918416268812 | Media we are seeing right through all this!! Can not wait to see the stories if Trump is victorious!!!😂😂😂
18 | Gabriel Gamez | 10154918409253812_10154918492098812 | Those women's are liar they are always have an accused of something they need jail time and give the boys a break
19 | Francisco Vazquez | 10154918409253812_10154918532473812 | They should give him 10 year of jail.. like the rest of the American people.. KGB trump.
20 | Laura Nguyen | 10154918409253812_10154918453603812 | Ugh...this is why i don't really care about any politics..In the end, its pointless to me.
21 | Jerry Giraldi | 10154918409253812_10154918424608812 | ABC News is so one sided. I wonder whats in it for them.... hmmm
22 | Steve Morgan | 10154918409253812_10154918457218812 | It's "fifteen minutes of fame". The least he could do would be to get the quotation right.
23 | Sasha Bens | 10154918409253812_10154918443433812 | It takes a very repulsive, crass, immature person to make comments like this...
24 | James Ivester | 10154918409253812_10154918419503812 | She is upset, she claims Russia hacked the emails...And they may have, that's an issue, if they didButShe's the one involved in what was typed in those emails....
25 | Yvonne Clerebout | 10154918409253812_10154918415618812 | Clinton will not say that the leaked emails were doctored or false, she just deflects on how this knowledge got out. The leaks prove she is corrupt.

Debate fact-check: Donald J. Trump claims the Clinton State Department lost $6 billion. Grade: False. #Debates
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Christopher Pipkin | 10154918378513812_10154918381148812 | You have lost your credibility ABC... #ABC - Another Clinton Puppet
2 | Winston Boswell | 10154918378513812_10154918395318812 | Let's not forget 'The False Claim' you guys labeled when Donald Trump said that Hillary acid-washed her email server. When the truth was BleachBit, as you guys claimed true.Is the truth actually that the Clinton State Department lost more money than what Trump said?
3 | Terry Elwood | 10154918378513812_10154918405178812 | Before the great deludge of media comments that will undoubtedly target Mr. Trump and his refusal to accept the outcome of the national election, I would like to point out that Mrs.Clinton was not asked that same question, and therefore will not be held accountable to the same criticism of not accepting the election results. Just an observation, just a point to ponder. No comments or questions necessary

5 | Katie Bryant | 10154918378513812_10154918403858812 | At least you're honest enough to call it "our grade". Ok so 6 million isn't missing but not accounted for. The ICE union represents officers agencies represent the government.
6 | Jason Scott Runyan | 10154918378513812_10154918434508812 | I've officially unlinked ABC news page on Facebook. You have lost all credibility with me. I used to trust you, but with this election you've been so obviously one sided spinning everything ... Are you the Spin Room now? David Muir I'm so disappointed with you! You used to have Diane Sawyer and Barbara Walter's integrity and now .... Bias.
7 | Warren Murray | 10154918378513812_10154918398248812 | This is what happens when an outsider comes into politics, politicians know that they are accountable to the people for their actions as well as their employment. When you allow rich, greedy, power hungry tycoons to rise to the top, they feel they are accountable to no one and if things don't go their way, they would rather destroy the government than preserve it. It's time to put trump and his sideshow to rest, send them back to the corruption, hatred and racist villages they came from. Enough is enough !
8 | James Edgard | 10154918378513812_10154918448553812 | Trumps  concession speech ---Trump on Syrian refugees in U.S.: "Wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary."

11 | Carl Millegan | 10154918378513812_10154918418998812 | You actually used the State Department to fact check Hillary! Ah, HA HA HA HA HA HA HA ....
12 | Tom Lacerte | 10154918378513812_10154918395953812 | The Clinton State Department made $3 million, from donations by the Clinton Foundation.
13 | Jimmy Decker | 10154918378513812_10154918407933812 | LOL i don't think she is going to give back that 25 Million from a Terrorist country of Saudi Arabia Funny Hillary herself said Saudi Arabia was a Country of Terrorist's but she dose not mind taking there money
14 | Teri Pizzurro | 10154918378513812_10154918418193812 | ABC don't worry you won't be killed by her for telling the truth. She can't kill everyone. So next time tell the truth!
15 | Cody Farver | 10154918378513812_10154918423773812 | ABC why don't you fact check this your ratings and credibility are both not in existence
16 | Bobo Man | 10154918378513812_10154918471958812 | Hillary claimed she cares about children and women who lives in North America. Then how about those Native Americans who live in Arizona and live in inhuman situations because our ancestors pushed them in a corner. Europeans call this a genocide.
17 | Paul Berti | 10154918378513812_10154918388438812 | ABC is owned by Disney aka the illuminati
18 | James Edgard | 10154918378513812_10154918442638812 | FACT CHECK: Trump says he doesn't know Putin.That's not what he has said in the past:
19 | James Edgard | 10154918378513812_10154918424563812 | FACT CHECK: Trump says he didn't mock disabled reporter.He did.
20 | James Edgard | 10154918378513812_10154918421968812 | FACT CHECK: Trump says he didn't say accuser's looks undermined her claim.He did. It's on video.
21 | Craig Blitzen | 10154918378513812_10154918389028812 | It would be an easier task just to do what he said was true, which was nothing.

24 | Tori Snow Kreklow | 10154918378513812_10154918391378812 | Everything that comes out of Trump's mouth is false!
25 | Andy Medlin | 10154918378513812_10154918503333812 | It is sad how you are still stretching the truth and/or flat-out lying for Clinton.   At least you admitted some of what she said was lies.      Half of what you said Trump was wrong about amounts to minor differences, such as calling 32 untrue and then saying that the real number was "more than two dozen".    Then there's how you gave Clinton a true about the 17 agencies when really it was JUST ONE PERSON.  PS- I care more about what the unions think than the agency heads - the unions actually have to answer to their people.

After two debates filled with pointed rhetoric, intimidation tactics and surprise guests, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump saved some of their most memorable lines for the third and final presidential debate. http://abcn.ws/2e8e1dR #Debates

2 | Janine Duff McDonald | 10154918332423812_10154918366773812 | I just COULD NOT handle listening to Stephanopoulos and his worship of Clintons. Luckily I found a live feed of spin alley on FB. You, CNN, MSNBC, all of you are ridiculous.
3 | David Sammy Jr. | 10154918332423812_10154918364243812 | You're such a nasty woman is one of the most distasteful things said during the debates,my opinion Trump doesn't have the Temperament to be President..Saying that the election is rigged is very childish Trump you're just not ready to be President you will never be ready to be President Trump try and get that through your thick orange skull.
4 | Aaron Thiel | 10154918332423812_10154918346963812 | Hillary turned into a stuttering mess that couldn't control the volume of her voice. Could you imagine her negotiating with a hostile Putin with WWIII hanging in the balance? Hillary is in over her head and she knows it. This isn't the peaceful world her husband seen during his presidency and it scares the crap out of her.
5 | Daniel Tallmadge | 10154918332423812_10154918411398812 | Lmao, I love ole Muir and George but did your staff watch the same debate I just watched? Y'all just trashed Trump strategically right after the debate and blatantly lied about what was said on national Television. There really is a strong need for non biased media. You have a responsibility to report the news and yet choose to throw a candidate under the bus as he does not fit your ideals. As said in media .."get your facts straight"
6 | Robert P. Doyle | 10154918332423812_10154918379148812 | So... if Hillary or her campaign says something over and over and over it must be true...So stop asking the hard questions!!!

13 | Travis King | 10154918332423812_10154918335528812 | REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

Mr Trump you doubting your own country security intelligence and believing Russia2. You just run-down the American democracy, where all candidates pledge to accept the election results whether they win or not. Your statement tonight just indicated you "may" not accept the results if you loose.3. Your choice of language and response towards your opponent as well is very disrespectful. Calling her nasty woman on stage was totally disrespectful4. You seems not to have any plans for the middle class5. Your plan on immigration; horrible. Like Hillary said, illegal immigrants even pay taxes more than you Trump.6. I will ignore your sexual harassment assault from the 9 women. For I think if is true then that's a shame on the American Justice system for not putting you on trail like they did to Bill Cosby who was similarly accused.I can go on and on and on, but I will stop here and ask: Please give me one GOOD reason why I should vote for you Mr Trump as the next American president?

The landmark law, better known as Obamacare, has meant that 20 million previously uninsured people now have health coverage. Many of them have purchased insurance through state or federally run marketplaces. But insurance companies have been abandoning these marketplaces left and right because they say it’s difficult to turn a profit, and the insurers that remain are asking for steep price increases all over the country.In Michigan, for example, state officials just approved price hikes of 16.7%, on average, for individuals purchasing health insurance in 2017 through the state’s Affordable Care Act exchange. Individual buyers can expect average increases of 20% in Colorado, meanwhile, and price hikes of 19% to 43% in Iowa next year.Such price increases are actually on the low side compared with states like Minnesota and Oklahoma, where individual plans will shoot up 50% or more on November 1, which is when signups for 2017 coverage on marketplaces are opened.According to the independently run, impressively comprehensive website ACASignups.net, the average increase for individual plans purchased through Obamacare marketplaces will be about 25% next year. This doesn’t mean that everyone will be paying 25% more for health insurance in 2017. Not remotely.The increases don’t apply to the vast majority of Americans, who get health insurance through work—and have their premiums partially covered by their employers. The figures cited also don’t factor in how most individual plans purchased via Obamacare marketplaces are subsidized by the government. Nearly 85% of the plans purchased through marketplaces receive premium subsidies because those being covered don’t surpass certain income thresholds.The headlines “do not reflect what these consumers actually pay because tax credits reduce the cost of coverage below the sticker price and shopping helps consumers find the best deal,” U.S. Department of Health and Human Services press secretary Jonathan Gold said recently, in a statement that’s typical of the administration’s response to news of skyrocketing insurance prices.Read Next: Here’s What’s Happened to Health Care Costs in America in the Obama YearsThis is all true. Yet it’s also true that for Americans who don’t get insurance through work, and who make too much money to qualify for federal subsidies, the cost of health coverage is about to soar dramatically, with premiums sometimes rising $1,000, even over $2,000 for the year. The list below is not comprehensive. It’s just a sampling of states where regulators have already approved some astronomical price increases for individual health plans next year.Alabama: 36% Individual plan premiums from Blue Cross Blue Shield—the only company offering individual plans in the state in 2017—will rise an average of 36% next year. Roughly 165,000 Alabama residents bought insurance through the marketplace in 2016. The new price hikes come on the heels of BCBS increasing premiums 28% from 2015 to 2016 for individual plans purchased through the marketplace.Georgia: 32% Humana sought a price increase of a whopping 65% for individual plans sold on the marketplace in 2017, while other insurers planned smaller increases ranging from 7% to 44%. Altogether, the price increases will average 32% for 2017, according to ACASignups.net.Illinois: 44%Throughout Illinois, the price of health care premiums will increase 40% to 50%, on average, for plans purchased on the individual marketplace. Average price increases for mid-level Silver and the lowest-price Bronze plans are both increasing 44% for coverage in 2017.For an example of how the increases translate to monthly bills for those purchasing insurance on the marketplace, a 21-year-old nonsmoker in Illinois will see the monthly premium for a Silver Plan rise 36% next year, from $229 to $312. That’s the equivalent of paying nearly $1,000 extra for the year, from $2,748 in 2016 to $3,744 in 2017. The price increase would be higher for an older (presumably less healthy) individual, especially if that person is a smoker.Read Next: One-Third of Counties Will Have Just One Obamacare Insurer by 2017Minnesota: 50% to 67%“Rising insurance rates are both unsustainable and unfair,” Minnesota Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman said in late September, while releasing the details of individual health plan increases purchased on the marketplace. “Middle-class Minnesotans in particular are being crushed by the heavy burden of these costs. There is a clear and urgent need for reform to protect Minnesota consumers who purchase their own health insurance.”He said that the individual marketplace was “on the verge of collapse,” and that the “rates insurers are charging will increase significantly to address their expected costs and the loss of federal reinsurance support.” The result is that premiums for the estimated 250,000 Minnesotans who buy individual insurance will rise 50% to 67% in 2017, though many of these individuals will receive subsidies to offset the price hikes. If individuals in Minnesota earn $47,520 or more annually, or families earn $97,200 or more, however, they are on the hook for the entire price increase if they’re insured through the state marketplace.Nebraska: 35%Individual health insurance rate increases range from 12% to 50% for Nebraskans purchasing on the marketplace in 2017, for an average premium increase of about 35%.Oklahoma: 76%Individual Obamacare premiums rose 35% in 2015. That sounds pretty steep, but it pales in comparison to the 76% price increase, on average, the Oklahoma Insurance Commission expects for individual premiums in 2017.According to HealthInsurance.org, “Oklahoma’s average rate increase for the individual market is by far the highest in the country for 2017.”Pennsylvania: 33% Pennsylvanians who purchase individual Obamacare insurance without subsidies will pay 33% higher premiums, on average, for 2017. As a result, the cheapest plan from Geisinger for a 40-year-old nonsmoker will cost $441 per month next year, up from $247 in 2016. For the year, that’s an increase of about $2,300, from $2,964 to $5,292.Read Next: At Least 1.4 Million Americans Are About to Lose their Obamacare Health PlansTennessee: 44% to 62% For 2017, the state approved individual plan increases of 44%, 46%, and 62% from Humana, Cigna, and Blue Cross Blue Shield, respectively. The state’s head insurance regulator approved the price increases in August after describing Tennessee’s individual marketplace as “very near collapse.”   SPONSORED STORIES

14 | Shirley Harris White | 10154918272968812_10154918299823812 | The reason ABC can say this is false is because ABC is one of the networks that is very biased against Donald Trump!
15 | Alicia Chung | 10154918272968812_10154918489138812 | This Trump will say anything by giving empty promises just to get the votes he has no plan nor he tells you what his plan for the people, this is so tricky and what a conman he is.
16 | Lauren Mirallegro | 10154918272968812_10154918309903812 | Not the least bit surprised to see that 5 of the 8 fact checked statements in this article are Trump's statements verified as false or mostly false.  And excusing not paying taxes as taking advantage of the current broken system (i.e. excusing a crime of opportunity) by pointing the finger saying "she let me do it" just shows the depth of his moral and ethical deficit.
17 | Vanessa Sapienza | 10154918272968812_10154918282353812 | After how many failed attempts at his businesses has he had and we should take his advice? No thanks!
18 | Marie Campion | 10154918272968812_10154918354628812 | Donald Trump WON tonight!! Hillary you don't stand a chance!!
19 | Phil Gorman | 10154918272968812_10154918312168812 | Mine went from $17 to $32 in 3 years and my deductible went from $1,000 to $5,0000
20 | JC Jun Cristobal | 10154918272968812_10154918302578812 | This bigot who lies after lies after lies after lies would even lie that he rigged the election😜😜😜because of the media lol
21 | Renee Weaver | 10154918272968812_10154918384028812 | ABC News why do you even bother calling yourself a news organization? You always fact check Hillary in her favor but never fact check Donald Trump in his favor. Why don't you just change your name to the Clinton News Network
22 | Tricia Jefcoat Wiggs | 10154918272968812_10154918336188812 | They say false because they are full of crap and killerys followers. Ask anyone who deals with insurance (not sells it) and they can tell you the truth on how outrageous it is!!  Jobs were lost all over our country due to Obamacare - people were fired or dropped to part time so that businesses won't have to pay for insurance anymore. Do the American people not remember all this stuff - it just happened within the past 3-4 yrs. of course the unemployment rate wasn't affected because most got on disability so therefore the unemployment rate looks good. You have to look at both things to know how bad it is but people don't pay attention to that!!
23 | Arie Beardown Jakubson | 10154918272968812_10154918324768812 | Of course ABC says it's mostly false. All media outlets are biased towards Hillary.
24 | Wanda Kinzeler | 10154918272968812_10154918348838812 | 3. 2002 THE HIV/AIDS FUND4. 2005 THE ASIAN TSUNAMI FUND5. 2009 Haiti Earthquake Relief Fund- THE CLINTONS STOLE $13.1 BILLION FROM HAITIAN REBUILDING FUND------------ACCORDING TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE HAITIAN SENATE! 6. 2013 Columbia-- $40+ MILLION STOLEN

Debate fact-check: Donald J. Trump says Hillary Clinton's economic plan is going to raise taxes, possibly double taxes. Grade: Mostly false. #Debates
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jonny Stevens | 10154918256613812_10154918262168812 | What worry's me Most about America, is they think its okay for the Future  leader and Leaders of the Country to LIE.....Lying to your OWN people is not Acceptable EVER..
2 | Valerie Johnston | 10154918256613812_10154918274838812 | regardless of the fact check I'm so disturbed by Clinton. There has NEVER been a candidate as crooked and connected to MONEY as her. I HATE THEM BOTH but him less than her!
3 | Sassan K. Darian | 10154918256613812_10154918260998812 | As long as all the good people of America don't get complacent and get out and vote, this election is over. Donald Chump Trump is simply a dangerous loose cannon that has no impulse control, is a raving lunatic and narcissist who subscribes to fringe conspiracy theories & is truly a demagogue of the sort that we haven't seen in our lifetimes. Whether you like her or not, Hillary has the experience, knowledge and temperament to lead our country forward. The choice is stark and clear for all rational Americans whether we are Republicans, Democrats or Independents. Despite the evidence, Trump still denies Putin was behind the hacks. He wants to make "Russia Great Again". #NEVERTRUMP. #putcountryfirst
4 | Zach Sobaski | 10154918256613812_10154918281538812 | Trump knocked this one outta the park. Just wish he'd of kept calm and done the first two debates as this last one. Better late than never! TRUMP 2016!!
5 | Valerie Johnston | 10154918256613812_10154918289653812 | Yet you say Trump's claim we don't know enough about Syrian refugees is false?! Your fact check says" The State Department has said “applicants to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program are currently subject to the highest level of security checks of any category of traveler to the United States". OK, that doesn't mean it's sufficient! He never said they weren't vetted! He said it wasn't good enouh!!!!
6 | Keeley Custer Borowski | 10154918256613812_10154918339128812 | Mostly false... what a joke... either it's true or its false. So disappointed with the media... especially ABC for their lack of support for BOTH sides. Create an even playing field for both parties and allow them to sway the opinions of the voters based on the campaign that they have created- don't do their job for them. Journalism is dead. I definitely look at the news much differently these days.
7 | Matthew Schmalz | 10154918256613812_10154918261703812 | Trump supporters need to accept the fact that people may actually prefer Hillary to Trump.
8 | Tiger Yi | 10154918256613812_10154918304158812 | If Trump cuts tax for all people (especially those at top), how could he bring down national debt with little government revenue? Where is these money coming from, his own pocket?
9 | Salina Appleona Fearing | 10154918256613812_10154918337828812 | Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump Will have the biggest tax cuts in history.... UM ok I will vote for that guy!! Hahaha :p
10 | Ahmad Mahmoud | 10154918256613812_10154918266138812 | She wins again and for the third time also , Trump has no experience and doesn't know what he's talking about at all #AmericaFirst
11 | T Elliott Cato | 10154918256613812_10154918352568812 | Attention Visitors: The Trumpanzees are currently in the midst of one of their frequent poo flinging fests. For your own well-being please do not attempt to engage, inform or feed the animals as they process their grief, but feel free to scroll through and observe their antics as they rage among themselves.Management greatly appreciates your patience and self-discipline.
12 | Ray N Tonya Crocker | 10154918256613812_10154918344558812 | Really? When these plans were first released I researched all nominee plans available. On a $95000 salary, our taxes biweekly did indeed double. I'm going to find the source that compared all plans in a chart because you're full of it. The Republican plans were the only ones where it wasn't raised.
13 | Bonnie Gibson | 10154918256613812_10154918311888812 | The only News Channel that ran the Debate tonite that will take up for Trump is Fox News( with the exception of Megan Kelly) all the others are against the republicans and Donald and will never take his side! Like Donald has said he has been slammed by all the News Media (which are mostly Liberal and for the Democrates ) !  Yes I believe there is fraud and things going on with the election and people voting more than once or after being dead , and voting early votes for Trump being thrown out or misplaced and all kinds of things and this will most likely never be prosecuted because like her lies on the emails and her getting by with allowing the Ambassador and our men to die and then lie about how it happened to the families and the American people ! She gets away with everything because they have the White House and the President protecting her and making sure she doesn't get charged for anything! Our system is corrupt and if she wins the election more corruption will be going on and the American people will be the ones having to pay in a very bad way!  We need change !
14 | Maxine Lopez | 10154918256613812_10154918320808812 | What has he taught our children that it is OK to attack woman I sure don't need a leader like that and those eyes he needs nose surgery with all his money hey trump do something get surgery ur to old u face is showing it to old to president maybe for a dog catcher no that either
15 | Robert Vandergrift | 10154918256613812_10154918335848812 | This proves ABC is for Clinton fact checker, Trump says something its false, but Clinton says something its fact. I hat eboth candidates but we need news media that's unbiased and revoke freedom of press for those who are biased because biased media such as ABC gives out what they want you to see, not the facts.
16 | Bruce Bullito | 10154918256613812_10154918262678812 | Donald nailed it for sure. A general was convicted of email fraud and this reject gets a pass. The system is rigged for sure.
17 | Linda Sears | 10154918256613812_10154918321358812 | First where do you think she's going to get the money for her free college? From the rich? If she becomes president, may God forbid that from happening, corporations will bail out of here. Rich people will move out and give up their US citizenship. Many have already left. That leaves the middle class and she will tax the middle class, what's left of it, into extinction. She is nothing but a liar first class, and to see the media, lying to put her into office, is sickening. No integrity, no honor, no character, no morals. Hitler would be proud to see the moral decay in this country. Satan's minions-Hillaty, Democrats in general, RINO Republicans and the 4 Estate. Special places in Hades for the evil ones.
18 | Doug Stubstad | 10154918256613812_10154918476688812 | of course it will,.. its what the tried and true democrat MO is,.. over tax, over spend, over regulate.. raise debt, print gobs and gobs of $$ and pretend there is economic success... when the GDP growth is a scant 1%... yay lame liberal policies.. LOL
19 | Andrea Smith | 10154918256613812_10154918262303812 | ABC just shut up. You're no longer a credible news source.
20 | Sandy Swaney Mahady | 10154918256613812_10154918308188812 | Why didn't Hillary answer the question where is the 6 billion dollars Hillary lost or stole from our gvmt !!??
21 | Lou Brody | 10154918256613812_10154918312588812 | This is the message she sent: Hillary avoids everything that incriminates her. She didn't talk about Haiti when asked. She didn't talk about pay to play when asked. She didnt talk about the fly zone when asked. She didn't respond to the comment that Trump made about the women being paid by the Hillary campaign. She didn't respond to the comment that it was just released that Hillarys campaign paid protestors to Trump rallies to cause trouble. She didn't respond about giving money back to countries that treat women badly. All things incriminate her. It shows her corruptness.
22 | Sonya Robillard | 10154918256613812_10154918293013812 | How about the media ignoring the fact that Hillary never answered the question of paying protesters!!! And Wallace letting it slide??? Or how about Hillary dodging the pay to play question? Wallace let that slide too!!! Why no questions about the Wikileaks??? Embarrassing and an insult to Americans for not exposing key information and facts of her lies and corruption. Trump all the way! 2016
23 | LaLania Loretta | 10154918256613812_10154918291393812 | Omg how about you fact check Hillary-- but no you won't because you are poor excuses for journalists. You are puppets, and you suck at your job.
24 | Melissa Wyatt Flanagan | 10154918256613812_10154918266938812 | If corporations are taxed more their will be significant layoffs.
25 | Rick Harmes | 10154918256613812_10154918308323812 | I'd rather have a Businessman who at least tries to make jobs, then a continuation of same old Politicians bs and corruption

1 | Bryan Mery | 10154918238453812_10154918249963812 | She just needs the black stripes running across it and then it's the perfect message to voters. #Hillaryforprison
2 | Lori Patterson | 10154918238453812_10154918252923812 | Trump is a man with a vision for America, not a specific vision, a great vision...the best vision...Trump has a plan to make this country great again....What plan??....a great plan...a plan that will work because it's the best plan.....Why???... because Trump knows good people...which people???....the best people....people that are not stupid like other people....people who know how to get deals done...what deals???...great deals...the biggest deals... because I know words... What words???...I have the best words... I get my information from watching TV... I consult with myself because I have a great brain... A great brain???...the best brain...Trump will also build a big wall to keep Mexicans out and he will make Mexico pay for it!...How....??? its all part of the great plan!...ISIS will be gone very, very quickly...How???... I won't tell you.. It's a secret !!!... (This guy is a “one-man circle jerk” and he is only about entertaining the uneducated who love him and his great plan. He's all air - no substance. And he is their “Champion”.)#NeverTrump #FTP #donaldCHUMPPlease feel free to paste and copy!Not my words, but it is brillant
3 | Nancy Cisneros Lanza | 10154918238453812_10154918246903812 | I really don't care either way, nor do any of you have anything to do with the outcome of this election...it's already done; any way...was she wearing Dr. Evil's suit from the Austin Powers movie?  seriously? lol
4 | Sheri Riehl | 10154918238453812_10154918256833812 | Since when is it acceptable for the Media to pick sides?  WTF.........How about you do a pole that tells the truth! Being female DOESN'T EQUAL being dumb enough to vote for her.........
5 | Wanda Kinzeler | 10154918238453812_10154918240803812 | CLINTON FOUNDATION FRAUD-2001 AIF American India Fund--$50 MILLION STOLEN$53 million raised, only $2.7 million spent!The Foundation didn’t even come close to the “100 villages” promise. In fact, a mere 7 villages were partially rebuilt and millions of dollars in funding was funneled to completely unrelated projects or entities.AIF’s top officers contributed at least $13 million to the Clinton Foundation and gave generously to Hillary Clinton’s political campaigns.

9 | Patricia Dahlke Warford | 10154918238453812_10154918245378812 | That's not saying anything she always wears a pant suit... it helps hide her tail

12 | Timothy Paul Carroll | 10154918238453812_10154918290973812 | Right after the debate... you talk about clothes? After 90 minutes of talk, this is the best you can discuss about your candidate? Her clothes? What about her words? What about her support of shoving a tube into babies skulls to suck the brains out during delivery after a nine month pregnancy?
13 | Sandy Swaney Mahady | 10154918238453812_10154918311723812 | Pure evil! Save a toddler kill a baby, don't answer where the 6 billion dollars are you stole or lost of our gvmt money and if you cannot answer a question you resort to mud slinging!! Never Killary

21 | Dan Winemiller | 10154918238453812_10154918270293812 | The media makes a big deal about Trump not saying he would except the outcome of the elections. Hey ABC,you morons ever hear of Al Gore?
22 | Jacquelyn Moore | 10154918238453812_10154918288663812 | We have not always had a peaceful transition of power. When Lincoln was elected an entire state succeeded. Not say there should be any succeeding, but we have not always accepted the out come.
23 | Ray Chalfant | 10154918238453812_10154918380893812 | Tell that to the little , 12 year old that was raped.  Hillary got her rapist off, by hiding evidence!! Then in an interview, she laughed about it. No feelings for the girl, a sexual predator on the loose. Yepper girls, the Hildabeast is going to fight for you!!!
24 | Tom Gray | 10154918238453812_10154918375343812 | It's the biggest fail liberal media has ever done. They used to be biased just enough to fool the American people that they were on the up and up. This election has been 100℅ clear that they can't be trusted. They are a propaganda tool. That's all they are now and I hope the American people understand what that means. They aren't working on behalf of the people anymore. They are working for the people that pay them the most and companies that want their way
25 | Frank-Nicole Rogers | 10154918238453812_10154918317563812 | She is so out of touch w reality. What the hell has she got to smile like a demon about shes so crazy. I was hoping in one of the 3 debates she would answer a questiong with her own words but no q card again!. Makes you wonder who is pulling her strings. She walks out with that big dumb smile and looks in woderment at all the dumb people who cheer for her.  Investigation, indictment and prison should be what people a re saying about hillary. Think about every minor ticket you had to pay and compare it to misuse and abuse of a political powershe lost 33,000 classified emails and says oops. This means that she failed at her job. I our anyone out there would be fired then prosecuted and labled as a criminal. I wish that everyone I know could get a pass on even one thing they have done.

Ivanka Trump says Donald J. Trump will accept the results of the Nov. 8 presidential election "either way."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ahmad Mahmoud | 10154918225803812_10154918229043812 | She wins again and for the third time also , Trump has no experience and doesn't know what he's talking about at all #AmericaFirst
2 | Logan Bradley | 10154918225803812_10154918234803812 | I wonder what it's like being in the Trump camp when there's no press or anything around, like do they know he's as nuts as we do or are they just as delusional as everyone else?
3 | Victoria Spencer | 10154918225803812_10154918239858812 | He definitely WILL NOT except the results. He will blame everyone but his own bigoted self. His daughter is just trying to once again cover for him.
4 | Melinda Grieski | 10154918225803812_10154918235833812 | ABC, can you show us anymore of your one-sided attitude for Hillary, Trump was correct though, we can and we are seeing right through your BS! Good try news media but we're onto your game!
5 | Deborah Crowe | 10154918225803812_10154918232648812 | to me, this is dumbest question ever proposed to anyone ever.  "will you accept the book i'm about to give you is a good read BEFORE you READ IT"  wth?  we have to see if there is voter fraud BEFORE we can accept anything, its not like voting in america isnt' under investigation right now?  is media really this collusional that it has to get its stories straight NOW?
6 | Drew Karanastic | 10154918225803812_10154918236273812 | Donald Trump did a great job. Laid plans to generate jobs, protect our borders and keep the 2nd Amendment intact. How could anyone support Hilldog? Deleting 33,000 emails after being subpoenaed,  proposing to grant amnesty to tens of thousands of illegal immigrants while having open borders, pay to play, the Clinton Slushfund, the slew of wikileaks scandals all while having a history of political failures.
7 | Dina Kailer Smith | 10154918225803812_10154918235933812 | So why can't he say it? Pence said it, Ivanka can say it, yet Trump keeps us guessing. The peaceful transition of power is a cornerstone of American democracy!
8 | Weston Kish | 10154918225803812_10154918236458812 | This came from the Advocate (a news paper) and I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump.  The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with.

9 | Jennifer White Simon | 10154918225803812_10154918240393812 | Once again, the guy who supposedly says what he means has to have a surrogate come out and tell us that he didn't mean what he said. #ImWithHer
10 | Tim Saracki | 10154918225803812_10154918232363812 | I just want him and his grotesque family to be shot into outter space...on Trump Airlines.Oh, that's right....
11 | Maria Smith | 10154918225803812_10154918301548812 | Both his vice presidential running mate, his campaign manager and his daughter are on the record for saying he will accept the results either way the election goes. Tonight he makes himself look like an a** by his suspense comment. Once a reality host, always a reality host. He can't even keep his camp together, how can he run our country? He's fired!!!
12 | Sylvia Bastani | 10154918225803812_10154918241133812 | Amazing how Trump women must rally to cover for this foul-mouthed, rude, ignorant little boy. After November 8, he's all yours!
13 | Sassan K. Darian | 10154918225803812_10154918226658812 | As long as all the good people of America don't get complacent and get out and vote, this election is over. Donald Chump Trump is simply a dangerous loose cannon that has no impulse control, is a raving lunatic and narcissist who subscribes to fringe conspiracy theories & is truly a demagogue of the sort that we haven't seen in our lifetimes. Whether you like her or not, Hillary has the experience, knowledge and temperament to lead our country forward. The choice is stark and clear for all rational Americans whether we are Republicans, Democrats or Independents. Despite the evidence, Trump still denies Putin was behind the hacks. He wants to make "Russia Great Again". #NEVERTRUMP. #putcountryfirst
14 | Chris Finch | 10154918225803812_10154918238858812 | Why does everyone have to treat Trump like a recalcitrant child after every debate?He said what he meant......yet even his own family feel they have to apologise for him
15 | Roxanne Seidel | 10154918225803812_10154918291173812 | I have trouble believing any of his children ever actually knew him as a father.  Until they understood that daddy meant.....$$ or material things. They probably never had a "Real" relationship with him.  Even then, it had to be based on that dangling dollar!!
16 | HillBilly Jim White | 10154918225803812_10154918267798812 | LOL..how does Donald say he will keep us in suspense...and yet his daughter then says he will accept the outcome? sounds like dysfunction in the Trumpfunction
17 | Steve Cavaliere | 10154918225803812_10154918269548812 | Nice always deflecting. You do have to remember that if the polls are already showing him leading (the real ones not the make believe msm) suddenly are wrong it can never hurt the honest people to take a hard look. Ironically I only had to watch 5 min of a focus group talking about the debate when it ended. Everyone was agreeing on Mt Trumps points on her not doing much of anything to make the changes that she was talking about when she was in a better position to do so. That was from a young lady that probably was a student. The rest were in the same mindset, bad experience is worse than no political experience. The young generation (the focus group) all see a very bleak future if the caca continues as it is now.
18 | Marie Tat | 10154918225803812_10154918267383812 | So they keep talking about whether he will accept the outcome however, they are not asking Clinton the same question so, doesn't it seem as if the powers-that-be already know the winner before we the people have even spoken? And yet there's no voter fraud, okay.
19 | Ralph Vendegna | 10154918225803812_10154918232283812 | Listen girl don't speak for your fathers ignorance. He needs to say it. He made a bigger Jackass out of himself to the World tonight.
20 | Gregory Audette | 10154918225803812_10154918394223812 | The level of collusion, corruption and illegal coordination between the Obama Whitehouse, DOJ , Hillary Clinton and the DNC is staggering !!!  Couple that with the extreme liberal bias of the media flooding the airways with negative accusations about Trump while giving Hillary a pass on criminal violations is disgusting !!  America is in moral decline !!
21 | Robert E. Jonas | 10154918225803812_10154918275308812 | Wait, wait wait... Hillary is all about saving 32,000 innocent toddler lives, but but but... she's all about aborting countless amounts of innocent babies?So, she wants to save lives, or end them? End Them.... She's on record that a baby is not alive even at 32 weeks, so its ok to kill them...My wife and i are expecting and she scares rhe Hell out of us!Major Robert Jonas,Ph.d.
22 | Jerry Galazin | 10154918225803812_10154918313633812 | I would not and will not vote for either...............I should be the next President....As an independed, i would make both parties work things out.......I will fix the Tax system, I will fix the Education system, I will fix the Medical system, I will fix the Social Security system, and i would create needed jobs, some way some how with what we need done here in America.............I would build our military and take care of them correctly.............I would continue to build and have a great relationship with our supporting countries around the world....I would do away with North Korea and i would put Russia on notice, while also dealing with China
23 | Becki Rogers | 10154918225803812_10154918265503812 | I wonder when ABC News is going to ask Chelsea how she feels about her father raping women and then her mother threatening the same women. Oh, that's right.... They won't. It's the Clinton Standard!
24 | Mary Kay Connolly | 10154918225803812_10154918453963812 | He never ever said He would not accept the result He simply said He would wait to see.He is a man with tenacity and doesn't feel to through the towel in just yet.Remember It's no over until its over.Why was that same question not asked to her?
25 | Tricia Jefcoat Wiggs | 10154918225803812_10154918310583812 | No experience vs failed experience!!!!  Like he said - she's been in government 20-30 yrs why hasn't she done something to fix things?!?!?  She almost fell out cause she didn't know how to answer. He is SO right - she has failed Americans so many times and even lied tonight several times about what she was for or not for in the past. Her and her husband started te NAFTA crap and thanks to them the housing market fiasco happened (exploded under Bush but it was cause of what they did in office). We do NOT need her and her cheating lying impeached husband back in the White House!!

1 | Patricia Higgins | 10154918198748812_10154918205923812 | Lie! Lie lie lie ABC. She talked over trump and sometimes even the moderator. Lie lie lie stop lying....what kind of favors are you and Hil doing for each other ABC?
2 | Cindy Rasmussen | 10154918198748812_10154918209068812 | If he interrupted or interjected with something meaningful, that'd be one thing.  But he was saying things a 12-year-old boy would say.  Putz.
3 | Alicia Sanchez Tijerina | 10154918198748812_10154918219268812 | ABC News, your so biased along with CNN, NBC etc. The American people are noticing, we're paying more attention now then ever! I know my eyes have definitely opened this past year and a half! It's all one-sided!
4 | Billy Westfall | 10154918198748812_10154918223073812 | I think it's rediculous that abc news immediately starts bashing trump, nothing about hillary at all. He must be one hell of a man that the news has to put him down on every aspect. I'm voting trump!
5 | Woods Sylvain | 10154918198748812_10154918206483812 | Trump lost another debate and the election. He's a sexist and racist clown with no plan, easily the worst candidate to be president ever. #FDT #ImWithHer
6 | Jordan Barker | 10154918198748812_10154918209733812 | America will be down the drain if Killary Clinton becomes president.Since when did a criminal be allowed to run for president!?!? Bengazi, 33k email deletion.....Damn this country is messed up!
7 | Joanne Nelson | 10154918198748812_10154918219543812 | Why aren't they ever asking Hildebeast if she'd accept the election results?! I'll tell you why...because they already practically have her in the WH barring the widespread election fraud we're witnessing. True The Vote for TRUMP!
8 | Jon David San Miguel | 10154918198748812_10154918216283812 | No he dominated period. He actually takes stances unlike Hillary who beats around the bush and flip flops like crazy. She says she's for kids but she supports innocent babies being murdered. Really now? She doesn't care about the unborn because they aren't the ones voting for her.
9 | Dustin Ray | 10154918198748812_10154918229258812 | Nothing pisses me off about this election and makes me want to vote for Trump more than seeing the overwhelmingly OBVIOUS lean that the media has towards Hillary and trying to make Donald look bad. I mean really, do you honestly think Americans that actually watch the debates are that stupid? No one should win our Presidency in such a crooked and dishonest and unintegral way. ABC news - the worst news source ever!
10 | Andrew Collet | 10154918198748812_10154918200938812 | Better be careful, ABC. People will take this as a sign that the election is rigged...

13 | Julie Woods | 10154918198748812_10154918222748812 | Hillary wouldn't shut up...if he didn't interrupt we would have never heard from him...Hillary talked twice as much as he did.
14 | Jenna Freeman | 10154918198748812_10154918230978812 | The people voting Hillary are voting for someone that is not only a liar, not only a criminal, not only the biggest disgrace to the women of America, but she wants a woman to be able to abort an innocent child at 36 weeks. Do y'all understand at 36 weeks a baby is absolutely fully grown, can in almost every case breathe on their own, they register pain. She is going to allow millions of abortions that tax payers will pay for. How will that help our debt? How is that humanitary? How is that okay? You mothers, how can you have your child looking up to such a woman? What a freaking disgrace!!!!! #TRUMP2016
15 | Nick Zelinsky Jr | 10154918198748812_10154918207168812 | The con man needs to go away. Really away. Maybe on a long vacation to Russia. Then he can wave to Sara on her porch.
16 | Samuel Ivan Olanya | 10154918198748812_10154918262293812 | With this kind of analysis from a reputable media house like ABC news, it shows clearly that Donald Trump is battling more than one Presidential candidate in the race to make America great again, the other candidates being ABC news, CNN and NBC news who are Hillary Clinton's dirty workers.
17 | Arlene Sharon Theresa Herbias | 10154918198748812_10154918288408812 | I agree with Patricia Higgins. The networks are not doing their jobs. They are in favor of Clinton. Instead of being Neutral. Be fair to both candidates. They don't talk about the Clinton Foundation or the e-mails. Or the fact she is responsible for 4 deaths. Children lost their Fathers and she wants to be President. Give me a break.
18 | Candice Sullivan | 10154918198748812_10154918258538812 | Not sure where you got that information from but Hillary interrupted him more then ever in this debate. Keep supporting that old hag and lying just like she does!!
19 | Lorie Quaney | 10154918198748812_10154918230073812 | I agree with Patricia. She interrupted him many times, but they make her out to be perfect. Can't believe they are so blind.
20 | Tanya Nicolai | 10154918198748812_10154918261843812 | He had to interject...he was never given the opportunity to speak as much as Hilary. She would ramble well past her two minutes and nothing was done to shut her up. She talks in circles, slings mud, and nothing but a liar.
21 | Christopher Kronheimer | 10154918198748812_10154918262228812 | It is so apparent who BIASED ABC wants in office! The biased MEDIA needs to stay out of politics period!

22 | Li Li | 10154918198748812_10154918228028812 | Bought and paid for by KILLERY whose been sleeping for three days while everyone else covers for her. ABC NEWSFLASH. You are not doing anyone any favors being so biased. Cable TV never looked so good.
23 | Dustin Ray | 10154918198748812_10154918277963812 | The fact that the media has to lie soooo bad and obviously says wonders about who is running. ABC news is disgraceful for thinking we are that stupid. I will vote for Trump because I don't want the media to have that kind of a powerful influence on our elections. And any candidate, like Killary, who has this much unbalanced support from the media just can't be trusted!
24 | Sarah Graden | 10154918198748812_10154918230923812 | I do not plan to vote for Trump or Hillary but am highly disappointed by how biased the 3rd debate is being discussed. Hmm, goodness, I wonder who abcnews is backing.
25 | James Chorrushi | 10154918198748812_10154918233598812 | Rigged again .I watched. Trump 2016. She rambled even after commentator tried to stop her more than once in same breath. And you could tell she carries a reciever because someone was cheering her on in her ear.

2 | Weston Kish | 10154918196748812_10154918228133812 | This came from the Advocate (a news paper) and I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump.  The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."

2 | Steve Cavaliere | 10154918188058812_10154918232818812 | Wow talk about desperate crash control. Of course he is right, but the real reason why is what the news is trying to hide. Not only are the border patrol vastly understaffed for what they are tasked to do (the wall would help immensely) but too many are being killed by the intruders. If this news outlet is going to make up caca as bad as she did then it is going to be a long night of taking out the trash.
3 | David Sammy Jr. | 10154918188058812_10154918204788812 | Trump can't even manage his businesses that went bankrupt one can just imagine what he will do to the American economy.. He totally lacks the compassion he's not a people person... He lacks the political skills and acumen he's totally unfit to be President he's a political neophyte...
4 | Maria Smith | 10154918188058812_10154918244713812 | Love how he points out the Border Patrol and I.C.E. has endorsed him. Neither agency is allowed by law to endorse any candidate. He was referring to their union. The head of the I.C.E union said sealing off the Southwest border won't be effective or actually secure anything. Jessica Edwards

9 | Travis King | 10154918188058812_10154918213348812 | REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
10 | PK Hernandes | 10154918188058812_10154918248193812 | Trump has repeatedly said the agency endorsed him. However, Trump did receive endorsements from unions representing ICE and CBP employees.

20 | Thom H. Pean Sr | 10154918188058812_10154918197193812 | Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn’t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, “Trump is arrogant.” My friend questioned if one man could make “that much difference in the world today.” To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, “Really, what has Trump done?”I said, “In June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.”As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the Black American community this question, I asked my friend, ”At this point, what do you have to lose?” We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year—one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I’ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we’re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That’s your right. Just don’t ever say he’s not effective.Megyn Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh’s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise … and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase—they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America’s problem isn’t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it’s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they’re not simply the “silent majority” as you’ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them “deplorables.” The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year.

Donald J. Trump interrupted Hillary Clinton and called her 'such a nasty woman' during the third and final debate. http://abcn.ws/2ekh7L4 #Debates

2 | Todd Jones | 10154918169068812_10154918176368812 | Donald also said the USA is a stupid country with stupid leadership. Absolute Moron!Also says he may not respect election results! Wow! Unacceptable answer and unfit to serve!
3 | Irene Shaw | 10154918169068812_10154918177523812 | "Such a nasty woman" But wait! Did he forget that quick when he said earlier "Nobody has more respect for women than I do, Nobody" LMAO Okay....excuse me Mr. Trump, who thinks it perfectly okay to violate woman? Who thinks that all Mexicans (and other immigrants) are rapist and killers? You? Ohhhh that's what I thought. You are the nasty one...
4 | Vicki Cantaloupi Schmierer | 10154918169068812_10154918175538812 | How quickly we forget!  If you’re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane—you won’t believe what you have forgotten.  If you’re under 35, read on—I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn’t a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
5 | Amber Davis | 10154918169068812_10154918189313812 | ABC I hate your station all you do afterwards is attack Trump when killary can't even answer questions about her foundations. Why cuz he said he don't know if he will accept the results. We all know the media is corrupt, including yous.
6 | Sassan K. Darian | 10154918169068812_10154918171653812 | As long as all the good people of America don't get complacent and get out and vote, this election is over. Donald Chump Trump is simply a dangerous loose cannon that has no impulse control, is a raving lunatic and narcissist who subscribes to fringe conspiracy theories & is truly a demagogue of the sort that we haven't seen in our lifetimes. Whether you like her or not, Hillary has the experience, knowledge and temperament to lead our country forward. The choice is stark and clear for all rational Americans whether we are Republicans, Democrats or Independents. Despite the evidence, Trump still denies Putin was behind the hacks. He wants to make "Russia Great Again". #NEVERTRUMP. #putcountryfirst
7 | Kelly Ribeiro Murphy | 10154918169068812_10154918178513812 | It only took seven minutes of watching that incredible dysfunction to realize our founding fathers must be rolling over in their decayed graves, wondering how their democratic system could end up in the hands of these two unprofessional, unethical, adult-children. Neither of them deserve the respect and honor that comes with the title of President. What an embarrassment to every American taxpayer. If this is the best we have to offer, we are screwed. Totally screwed. 🙄
8 | Leslie Markow | 10154918169068812_10154918181178812 | Nasty ?????? That doesn't begin to cover it....try corrupt, slimy, indecent, wicked, awful......maybe even evil. But nasty ??? Let's get real......
9 | Amy Leigh Catterton | 10154918169068812_10154918195603812 | This is sad. How many people have said what he did.. He was telling the truth. She is a nasty women. U shouldn't be so offended..... Trump will make this country great again!!! ABC sham on you for this trash! There was plenty to nagg on Hillary but you want to attack Trump.
10 | LoriAnn Hyde BillTaylor | 10154918169068812_10154918184808812 | So far for the 20 minutes since the end of the debate ABC has only talked about how Trump isn't going to win. Not one word about what Hillary even said. Sound worried to me.
11 | Lisa McClure | 10154918169068812_10154918191758812 | I am sick of hearing your negativity against Trump also. All the polls I see call Trump the winner. If you want to believe her lies that is your business, but there are lots of people who don't and will not vote for her.
12 | Susan Sapp | 10154918169068812_10154918193363812 | Al gore did contest the election. They had a recount. He sued over it and said Bush stole the election. Your reporters lied about what Trump said. He said , he will make that decision at that time.
13 | Barbara Rodriguez | 10154918169068812_10154918185353812 | "Such a nasty woman" But he says "Nobody has more respect for women than I do, Nobody" Mr. Trump you make me sick!!
14 | Shandra Mcpartland | 10154918169068812_10154918189108812 | the trumpeters are losing it. They smell a loss in three weeks and they are starting to flail! Can't wait to sit back and watch! hillary 2016!
15 | Erica Gunderson Salsbury | 10154918169068812_10154918195413812 | Such a rude man! Thank god I don't let my son watch this...I would never want him to be like this man!! Or even think that acting like him is okay.
16 | Deb Ellette | 10154918169068812_10154918212673812 | absolutely love the debate very outstanding Donald Trump won it hands down left Hillary Clinton Way Way in the dust and yes he had every right to call her a nasty woman she was very nasty she got very angry very mad the facial expressions the body language and everything else when the truth started coming out commentator was absolutely outstanding very professional very very balanced he absolutely did not show any favoritism unlike the other two debates with the commentators he was an absolute great commentator I wish that the other debates had him as the commentator it would have been very good debates or someone like him instead of who they had I don't know how they pick them but when they picked this gentleman they did outstanding glad they saved the best for last I am just glad a lot of the truth come out about the emails and the other things. I am extremely proud to have watch the debates I thought that it was outstanding and it definitely made my mind up who I will be voting for come November 8th I am a college graduate educated woman and my vote will definitely be going for Donald Trump
17 | Weston Kish | 10154918169068812_10154918239988812 | This came from the Advocate (a news paper) and I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump.  The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."

True journalism is honest, fair  and unbiased . . . Just because YOU (ABC) are fierce Democrats does NOT mean that the rest of us are! Please go back to true, unadulterated journalism!!! God bless the USA!
19 | Debbie Boznango Doshier | 10154918169068812_10154918226503812 | He says over and over how no one respects women more than him...then he calls Secretary Clinton a nasty women. Not smart Donald.
20 | Richard Murphy | 10154918169068812_10154918340943812 | Fdr died in his girl friends bed. Ike had a lover. J F K had several brother Ted drowned Mary Jo. Clinton was impeached. The weak Republicans should have put him out of office. Hillary let four Americans die in Benghazi, Then called one mother a liar. Don't forget Anita Hill and the coke can with a Pubic hair during JustusClarence hearing. Trumps remarks can't compare with your stupid remarks
21 | Stephanie Sturgill Morrow | 10154918169068812_10154918200373812 | I have said for months that our founding fathers must be ashamed of what our country has become. However, ANYONE woman that has a daughter and could possibly fathom voting for Trump.....you need your head examined along with him. I'm not saying Hilary is the answer but to think that a person such as Trump has any business running for this office is a joke within itself. 🙈🙈🙈

23 | Mando N Lsa | 10154918169068812_10154918234528812 | Contradictive to his statement, "No one has more respect for women than me." He's a liar, a narcissist and demeans women and other races any time he doesn't like what's been said. Vote Hillary!
24 | Nancy Hornof | 10154918169068812_10154918226403812 | It's all about who has the money to run. I know some fine people and smart that could do better than half the schmucks in office. But they don't have money and maybe if the candidates had to run without money that's attached to favors we could have some great leaders.
25 | Jeff-Kristi Molyet | 10154918169068812_10154918191458812 | Will he accept the results of the election if he doesn't win?....well back during the GOP race, when all the candidates were asked if they would stand behind who ever wins, they all said yes. Well we all see how that turned out,  so why would he jump and say yes!

2 | Rakibul Islam Shohel | 10154918137328812_10154918141933812 | Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."No I did not write this, its a share of a share of share, I don't take any credit but I thought it was to hilarious that it deserved to be reshared.

5 | Roman J Sawczak | 10154918137328812_10154918159628812 | I have never seen such ignorance as the post debate peanut gallery st ABC. Trump eas asked about "accepting" the election results. What does that have to do with transfercof power??? He is not the outgoing president. He has no power to refuse to transfer. Beyond stupid. Oh wait Georgie boy worked for the Clintons. No bias here folks. Lol
6 | Robert Vandergrift | 10154918137328812_10154918166548812 | Clinton claims Trump wants to break up NATO and biased ABC marks that as true, just because Clinton says so. How obvious does ABC want to be about which side they're on.

Hillary assumed with the tax question that raising taxes will help with the deficit... how has it helped so far? Wouldn't lowering it so it's easier for more small businesses to open up and employ more people bring in more?

21 | Liliyanna Grace Warren | 10154918137328812_10154918167493812 | Donald Trump . What is 2+2 ? Answer 4 ... ABC fact check him now it can't be true .
22 | Patricia Higgins | 10154918137328812_10154918175063812 | Now we wait for George and ABC to distort the debate..
23 | Donn Douglas | 10154918137328812_10154918191063812 | ABC could you be any more obvious in your contempt for Trump?  I guess you don't even pretend to be unbiased anymore. Maybe you haven't heard of these CLINTON LEAKED EMAILS from WIKILEAKS because bi haven't heard you mention them much. If you do you gloss over them real quick.
24 | Donna Maguire | 10154918137328812_10154918143093812 | ABC news you are so Biased it's disgusting.

When asked if he will accept the outcome of the election, and if he loses, concede to the winner, Donald J. Trump refused to say. "I will tell you at the time."

2 | Joseph Chandler | 10154918118873812_10154918138228812 | After tonight I will be voting for trump. It's clearly obvious trump had rattled Clinton and has gotten under her skin. #MakeAmericagreatagain #trump2016
3 | Elizabeth Oluwafumnilayo Owolabi | 10154918118873812_10154918144188812 | He had one job. Show us that you have the temperament to be the leader of our country. If you lost, would you peacefully accept the loss? "I don't know, I'm gonna keep you on your toes.." WRONG.
4 | Kim Haynes Stephens | 10154918118873812_10154918134478812 | You could lay the bodies left in the Clinton's wake on the steps of Congress, or deliver indictments for her every crime to the Supreme Court, and it would mean nothing to anyone except for the millions of Americans willing to say no more. We will stand together until Hillary Clinton is defeated. She may have the Media. We have the votes. We will save this Nation.
5 | Steve Pescitelli | 10154918118873812_10154918141403812 | As soon as the debate is over all you media start talking crap about trump the American people can see what you are doing and you all should be ashamed .
6 | Aaron Warner | 10154918118873812_10154918154288812 | Al Gore!!!  Al Gore did not accept election results!  He took it all the way to the Supreme Court and democrats screamed bloody murder for 4 years!!!  How dare you hypocrites go after Trump for choosing to see if there is voter fraud. #veritas project
7 | Ruth Preston Scheeler | 10154918118873812_10154918155508812 | Great job Trump! You are right! The last thing I want in this country is more of the Obama administration. I'm sick of politics as usual. HRC has no desire to make this country great again, this is just something to add to her resume. At least Trump cares about the country. He may not have all the answers now, but he is a smart business man who knows how to get the job done. I would rather have someone with no political experience than to have another sleazy, slimey, lying, thieving politician who surrounds herself with lackeys to do her dirty work. And how DARE she say she respects women???? What a crock! This deplorable is voti g for Trump!
8 | Cindy Hoage | 10154918118873812_10154918160638812 | How about you cover a story on why Hitlary didn't acknowledge Donald mentioning the 30,000 emails that she deleted and lying to the FBI.  Oh wait.....she owns you so you won't touch that.
9 | Michelle Morris-Rainer | 10154918118873812_10154918157463812 | Oh get over it media!  So he said he might protest the election. He has a right!  The crooked Clinton machine and years of crooked democratic votes it's his job. It's Americas job to hold these nasty lying political thugs accountable!
10 | Paul D Smith | 10154918118873812_10154918135733812 | That is one of the stupidest questions ever.  It's like asking a candidate how they will feel if they lose.  Silly and pointless.  What happened to real journalism!
11 | Alice Sell | 10154918118873812_10154918156978812 | He is sooooooo UN-American! He is going to keep us in suspense as to whether he will accept the results of the election. WTF! He is everything that is wrong in America! He is clueless, delusional, full of hate, spite, and a complete sociopath/psychopath.  Pathetic excuse for a human being.
12 | Sasha Bens | 10154918118873812_10154918143263812 | Donald Trump has the mentality of a junior high school mean girl, hell bent on revenge, with a full blown Twitter addiction...we all know what he's going to do when he loses. His ego is too fragile to admit loss. Grow up crybaby!
13 | Pat Gushanas | 10154918118873812_10154918131753812 | HILLARY WINS ..TRUMP AGAIN CANNOT KEEP TO THE QUESTIONS
14 | Raja Wahid | 10154918118873812_10154918131478812 | How to interpret constitution = Hillary won & Trump was confused and stuck in his own logicsSecond amendment = Hillary wonIssue of  women right to abortion = Hillary won & Trump tried to avoid the question with blah blah #womb #NinthMonthIssue of immigration = Trump still want the wall and says drugs are coming and want the immigrants out & Hillary not in flavour of deportation of 15 million ppl but in favour of boarder security and deportation of violent pplDo you condemn the interference of Russians = Tumps was yes and again saying don't know Putin & Hillary said it's been reported by 17 state agencies that Russia is meddling the election process but the results is 60% trump and 40% HillaryTaxation system and economy = Hillary, minimum wage, equal wage, tuition free college and new jobs and big corporations pay more taxes and TRUMP didn't responded the question but stuck with NATO and Saudi Arabia and other alleys to pay for security #HillaryWonGroping women by Trump and issues of Clinton = trump said all the women are paid characters by Hillary campaign and Hillary quoted all the instances and exposed his nasty character of groping women #HillaryWonClinton foundation = 11 million are the beneficiary Hillary responded & added that CF has the highest rating and raised 30 million for Haitians #HillaryWonElection is rigged = Trump said that he will decide on Nov 09 whether to accept the results or not and further added that media is corrupt and it makes the election rigged. Hillary said that trump don't trust either FBI, RNC, Judges etc and it's his mindset #HillaryWonIraq and ISIS, boots on the ground?= Hillary said that we will support Iraqi army and don't want boots on the ground but will do arial attacks on ISIS and will look for political solution. Trump still wants the element of surprise in his attack on enemy which is illogical and will result in collateral damage #HillaryWonSyria and Aleppo = Trump added Syrian refugees are troggen horses however, Hillary said that we should go for political solution and added won't stop refugees and will work with Muslim communities!! #HillaryWonNational debt = Trump said will increase GDP growth increased by 5 to 6% which seems to be unrealistic however, Hillary said that she will add nothing to national debt and added will make the big corporations to pay more tax #HillaryWon
15 | Jonathan Hanson | 10154918118873812_10154918161828812 | Trump made her look like a fool. 30 years in government and all Hillary has done is lived of the hard work of the American people.  I'm tired of free loaders!
16 | Joel Christopher Payne | 10154918118873812_10154918146728812 | Hillary supports slavery. She considers immigrants as a net-positive to our economy. That means she has no problem exploiting illegal immigrants as slave labor in order to keep your produce cheap. And don't they pay taxes with stolen Social Security numbers? Isn't that a federal offense on top of being a legal also a federal offense?
17 | Paul Doucette | 10154918118873812_10154918188238812 | Just reminded of something, did Gore accept losing the election against Bush? Or did he sue and demand a recount in Florida? Not always is it a smooth transition of power. People shouldn't be so outraged by Trump's comment.
18 | Andrea Gravenhorst | 10154918118873812_10154918162458812 | America needs a president who's not a politician. God help this Country if the witch were to win. Clinton is liar and criminal, and should be in jail. Go Trump! :)
19 | Rob Swart | 10154918118873812_10154918179783812 | Trump must be defeated by such a large margin that his supporters get the clear message that his hedge on insurrection if he loses would be suicidal!!!!! Stand up for our Democracy. Trump is the only person who refuses to accept the verdict of the people. Just suggesting this should bring charges of treason. God save America.
20 | Weston Kish | 10154918118873812_10154918205283812 | This came from the Advocate (a news paper) and I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump.  The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."
21 | Ken Roach | 10154918118873812_10154918156278812 | Why is this upsetting or shocking? I despise this woman and do not except her regardless of the outcome. And I am one of millions that feel the same way
22 | Renee Tedford | 10154918118873812_10154918215768812 | John Spencer said it best! "Someone asked me today how I stand up for Trump, a misogynist, a racist and a bigot. Here is my answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.Because DT has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist. ...Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.Because he fought the West Palm Beach City to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.            Because he has raised wonderful children that have turned out to be outstanding, hard working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.    Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based on what is best for my family, my friends and my country.Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinion, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?    Because I want a SCOTUS that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges that are more like political activists than law enforcers. I do not want the same fate for the SCOTUS.Because I fear for my family's safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues, which is a threat to our way of life.            Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount and, as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because he is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.          Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.And last, but not least,Because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says. I could have gone on and on, but I think you get the picture."
23 | Ada Vega | 10154918118873812_10154918142098812 | This is not the apprentice Donny. You cant keep the suspense. It's not how running for president works.
24 | Andrew Conrad | 10154918118873812_10154918147268812 | I just realized something.. Where is Hillary's American pride? She must be to good wear a flag pin on the vacuum bag material jumpsuit! #debatenight
25 | Douglas Teegarden | 10154918118873812_10154918192798812 | Did you all see how relaxed and calm trump was by comparison to Hillary. Donald had her back on her heels from the outset. You could see it on her face all night.

1 | Anthony Michael LeBato | 10154918113983812_10154918117848812 | Take a seat ABC, you've been exposed already. Your on hillarys side, no one cares for your fact checks that are never run on Hillary.
2 | Steve Lovesee | 10154918113983812_10154918133588812 | even the FBI stated there was no way to vette all those immigrants.fact check ABC you looked stupid and biased.
3 | Sheri Riehl | 10154918113983812_10154918137173812 | And we are going to believe a damn thing the news media says? GIVE ME A FLIPPING BREAK! You don't have the balls to be honest about what is really happening in our country!
4 | Mary Evans | 10154918113983812_10154918118793812 | Fact check!! Donald Trump was not for the Iraq war.You want to fact check on him then fact check on her!! She is a liar
5 | Andrea Barre Ellis | 10154918113983812_10154918143398812 | All Bout Clinton (ABC), your fact checks are BS. Trump was NEVER for the Iraq war and has been proven. And, how are refugees vetted if they have no ID, and NO way to check their background? Hillary is so full of BS! She does not stand for anyone or anything unless she benefits! God help us if she is elected!
6 | Katie Cogdill Herie | 10154918113983812_10154918151998812 | And hillary is a killer ,lier and much much more but if that's the woman you'd like fir your daughter to look up too GOD BE WITH YOU really hope you do not become the first female president.I write this not because I am some crazy, right-wing, anti-feminist conspirator; I hope you are not our first female president because it would be a disgrace to that title and a disgrace to all of the young women in our country who aspire to actually do some good for our nation.Many people believe you are the best candidate for the position because you have been doing this political thing for a while—but when was the last time that you were able to relate to the common American?You grew up in the rich white suburbs of Chicago as a young child and attended Yale. You then went on to ride Bill’s coattails all the way to your Senate seat as a former First Lady. Any true feminist would look at you and see that you are a fraud.You get on your soapbox and claim that every woman who is a victim of sexual assault should be heard—but what about Juanita Broaddrick? Carolyn Moffet? Paula Corbin? Sara Allen-James? Christy Zercher? Kathleen Willey? Monica Lewinsky? All women who were sexually harassed or exploited by your husband.Yet you stand by him continuously, defending him and helping clean up his messes. If you ask me, that’s not very appealing to me as a woman. You also stood by him after he openly admitted to having “sexual relations” with Monica. That sounds like a very conservative stand by my man move if you ask me.If you were as independent as you portray yourself to be, why didn’t you just leave Bill? Because you needed his political access to get your foot in the door.All of that aside, the sheer fact that you allowed four Americans to perish in Benghazi and then proceeded to later ask, “what difference does it make?” proves to me that you don’t care about American lives. Those were four American men who died. Four families in our country that suffered a loss. Four mothers that had to bury their sons.“What difference does it make?”“Because it’s not just a detail if it’s your kid, if it’s your family. It’s a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president, too.”A detail to you, former Secretary—but to those families, a huge difference.Not to mention you want to allow all of these refugees in. Don’t get me wrong: I am a humanitarian. However, I, as an American citizen, am guaranteed safety as well as the safety of my future children and grandchildren in the Preamble of the Constitution of the United States.The one thing, if nothing else, that you as someone running for President of the United States should uphold. I understand that we should help people, but at the end of the day, would Syria do the same for us? In our time of crisis it is our job first and foremost, and yours, to ensure our own citizen’s safety.You use your platform of charitable humanitarian but now we are learning the extent to which your foundation is a fraud. It’s nothing but a money-laundering business that you can catch a tax break from.Which, by the way, is a wee bit illegal.You took up monetary donations after the Haiti earthquake and, yes, you did build a textile factory—on the opposite side of Haiti that wasn’t even affected by the earthquake. You also conveniently signed off Uranium to be given to Russia just after Uranium One shareholders deposited $145 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. How thoughtful of them.You also claim to be against big business and fight all the big bad business bullies, but you’re in bed with them!Your daughter is, too. Your daughter married a former investor for Goldman Sachs. Your family managed to help spend some odd $3 million on their wedding. Wonder where that money really came from.You claim to be a friend of the black community and that you’re going to help bring them out of poverty. Look around! You are a part of the administration that has left them where they are and you have no intentions of changing that. You want control. Your mentor Saul Alinsky taught you that.You don’t know any struggle or strife. You are the epitome of “white privilege.” You traipse around in heinous $12,000 suits and preach about how you are for the people—how you are going to pull them out of poverty as you attend events where you give 20-minute speeches to the tune of $500,000 and eat $800 plates of food on your private plane.You have never faced financial strife. What makes you think you can help fix our national debt crisis?Above all things, if nothing else, the reason why I hope you don’t become the first female president is because you are a criminal. It does not matter if you didn’t intentionally use a server that was not secure. I may not intentionally go 55 in a 40 but the police officer is going to give me a ticket. I may not intentionally kill someone in a car accident; however, I can still go down for manslaughter. People don’t intentionally become drug addicts but you bet they still end up in prison for possession.You think you are above the law. You manipulate the system, which is not what a leader does. It’s not right.I am not some right-wing conspiracy theorist lunatic. I simply look at the facts.These facts tell me that I wouldn’t let you look after my pet rock, much less this nation.Yours truly,A Real Future Female Leader
7 | Donna Stokes Betts Layton | 10154918113983812_10154918164863812 | I have always preferred ABC News to any other. However, I am almost totally done with ABC News. You people are so biased against Trump that you make me sick. You are judgemental of him, you are unfair to him. Personally I don't give a damn about your viewpoints on any of it. Report the news but leave your personal thoughts out of it and report it fairly.
8 | Angela Heggie Grassano | 10154918113983812_10154918153353812 | So obvious the media is biased to Hillary. I have not yet made a decision who I am voting for but it is beyond obvious who the media wants. ABC I have watched you for years and your coverage after the debate was completely biased to Hillary. Disgraceful. And look at this fb page
9 | Ardalan Omer | 10154918113983812_10154918147843812 | She is too smart to go against a man with 0 intelligence. I feel so bad that she has to play in the same ballpark as him and people are actually following him. I'm with her.
10 | Terri Brewczynski | 10154918113983812_10154918192768812 | Why is it that Trump supporters seem to think that all media(except Faux news) is biased?  Could it be that your candidate is unquestionably unqualified for the job?
11 | Dee Bell | 10154918113983812_10154918171968812 | Trump has just handed the election to Hillary when he stated he will decide on election day if he will accept the results of the election. That is the most dangerous statement any presidential candidate has ever made and I believe Trump will lose because of it.
12 | Tamika Pl | 10154918113983812_10154918192658812 | The problem is we cannot turn our backs on the innocent, America never has and they never will. Trump supporters seem to forget that the recent terror attacks have been committed by Americans. Including Timothy McVeigh. At what point in Great America will people learn not to generalize populations of people?
13 | Dominick Mileto | 10154918113983812_10154918183213812 | And where did you fact check this ABC??? This administration is so crooked and clueless, hey really don't know who is in our country!! But then ABC is the Hillary network right, Stephonopolis?

15 | Bob Wambold | 10154918113983812_10154918184643812 | who would believe ABC or any other news network...we know there have been thousands brought into the US already...so, it is true...and, Lady Liar, has said, and didnt deny, that she wants to let a lot more into the US....and, fyi, in Lincoln, NE today, 2 felons with long history of violent crimes in the US, were arrested with guns....oh, muslim names....as of yet, they havent said where they are from....i think from somalia....
16 | Wendy Lofton | 10154918113983812_10154918318778812 | Really ABC? Why don't you listen to the FBI when they said there is no way to properly vet the refugees. Oh and have you missed the thousands that Obama has already let in? Trump was right on this one.
17 | Suzanne Latimer Tyson | 10154918113983812_10154918164398812 | On C-Span Congress with Trey Gowdy at the wheel, they questioned the directors of the FBI, Homeland Security and the CIA.   All three directors said the refuges could not be properly vetted, because ISIS destroyed public records.  You will never be able to convince me or Mr. Gowdy the lie they can be.
18 | Cathy Portnall | 10154918113983812_10154918180508812 | ABC are you going to fact check Clinton? Been watching you for 45 years bit have to say I'm quite disappointed in your one sided views re this election. You should be neutral and you are not!
19 | Charlie Jedi-Prick Boggus | 10154918113983812_10154918159008812 | Did you consider the TPS countries of Syria, Qatar and Somalia, whose Temporary Protected Status refugee's are overloading the resources of Mexico while waiting entry into the U.S.

21 | Miriam Gutierrez | 10154918113983812_10154918172498812 | Allow me to fact check you, the FBI has said many times they can not fully vet refugees, they come with no papers.....your fact check is FALSE with capital F

23 | James Gavlik | 10154918113983812_10154918190113812 | I think Hillary said there was no way to vet the refugees coming from Syria in a banking speech we all know they can't be veted and most of us know that they funded isis through the state department to start that war in Syria
24 | Clem Payan | 10154918113983812_10154918158043812 | Donald lost it completely, he all but conceded to Hillary, what a sorry package of human being is Trump, she got him really good when she reminded Trump how he also badmouthed Reagan, showing that That's all he does, speaks ills of others, while taking advantage of the system and not offering any real solutions for any problems. She just moped the floor with Trump!!!
25 | Richard Crismond | 10154918113983812_10154918128443812 | Funny how its always fact check on trump l, how abkut fact check on Clinton!

Donald J. Trump on Hillary Clinton: "She has taken in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees who probably in many cases, not probably, who are definitely in many cases ISIS aligned." abcn.ws/2eHIHV4 #Debates

1 | Philip Schrepel | 10154918112323812_10154918135768812 | She says she wants to ban guns so toddlers cant kill people yet she boasts about her support for abortion..that is about the most idiotic thing I've ever heard of.
2 | Jeph Odex | 10154918112323812_10154918115388812 | Hillary Clinton on Donald J. Trump: "What part of America first leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado? Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan? Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio? Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin? Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again. He could start by actually making things in America again."
3 | Sonia Y. Solla Nelson | 10154918112323812_10154918139713812 | Sorry but I have to share this! Lol. 🎃🎃🎃Q:What do Donald Trump and a Pumpkin have in common?A:They're orange on the outside, hollow on the inside and responsible people will throw them away in early November. 😂🔫
4 | Erin Lylatroid Valencia | 10154918112323812_10154918139183812 | Trump? Shut up! Just shut your hypocritical trap! You're worthless! Your wife is UGLY! Your daughter is STUPID! Your son is a MONSTER like you!! Get out of our country or you'll be FORCED to leave! If you guys get punished by YOUR KIND, GOOD!!! That'll make my day!
5 | France Eco | 10154918112323812_10154918122613812 | AMERICA WAS ALREADY GREAT, SO WE DON'T NEED TEMPER TANTRUMS
6 | Olivia Koehler Zajec | 10154918112323812_10154918143293812 | Take in the refugees, don't turn away the women and children....but wait, I support the slicing and dicing of an unborn fetus. #dumbbitch #hilaryforprison
7 | Ramon Santos | 10154918112323812_10154918132853812 | Oh God, why anyone with a 9 grade and up edu will support this Buffoon...of Donald Trump....what a clown...!
8 | Steve Cavaliere | 10154918112323812_10154918154373812 | The best one yet is when she claimed she will vet all of them when the feds already said they cannot vet any of them with the resources they have now. Either she does not have a clue or is just plain lying.
9 | Christine Gabriele | 10154918112323812_10154918132433812 | How about the three Americans that were recently arrested in Kansas for plotting a bombing on a Somali refugee camp?
10 | Shannon Asbell | 10154918112323812_10154918148533812 | I was undecided. I was going to vote for Johnson, to stand up and change our damn country. But, since most people only want one of these two people. Clinton will be getting my vote. She is so much highly educated than Trump. She acts and sounds like a President. Trump on the other hand sounds like a little kid who isn't getting his way. No. Only thing I wished for was if Clinton would have called  him a dictator in the making. Yea
11 | Rachel Lewis | 10154918112323812_10154918160563812 | It's so laughable that Trump can just fabricate definitive statements regarding refugees and the vetting process. I'd bet money Trump couldn't make it through the vetting process that refugees have to go through. His willingness to speak completely out of turn and using his baseless opinions is really the fodder we're all watching these debates for. I wouldn't vote for him with my enemy's vote and a ten-foot pole to push the button. 😂
12 | Chris Recla | 10154918112323812_10154918165253812 | She looked defeated! She's been caught in so many lies ! Hers are far more devastating then his lies , wish he would have had the families of the those who were left behind to be killed in the front row!
13 | Will Bink | 10154918112323812_10154918143883812 | Trump camp says, "I'm with you America". Clinton camp says, "I'm with Her!"Notice Hillary has yet to wear an American flag 🇺🇸 on her overcoat.
14 | Sandeep Singh | 10154918112323812_10154918179693812 | American is hating on trump thts the plan.. right under ur nose she will sell American jobs to Bussiness visa immigrants the positions which American citizen deserves. She will trade America for money for herself and corporate Americans safe havens.. she today agreed to send troops back to Syria.. damn Americans are delusional. Some time truth is not what is portrayed. She is devil not the guy who speaks his mind.
15 | Gabriel Ashton Hazen | 10154918112323812_10154918348293812 | After watching the debate all I can say is that I am ashamed for the people of the USA. Here we are on the brink of the biggest decision in our country and we are left with bigotry,deceit,disrespect and idiocy. While we stand by these faults and accusations we do nothing but assist in the moral degradation of this country.I haven't voted, and I wont vote. I will not support a country that doesnt support its people in a way of utmost care and consideration.Here and for the foreseable future we will lie awake at night hoping for an outcome worthy for a nation that has barely stood on it's own two feet since it's foundations were lain.
16 | Carol Roy | 10154918112323812_10154918320223812 | Maybe he should have watched 60 minutes this past Sunday and maybe just maybe he would have an idea about the vetting process refugees have to go through, but I highly doubt he even cares...
17 | Mark Shipwash | 10154918112323812_10154918262578812 | If only Trump could talk like a lying politician, then it would have been a walk in the park. She has had more years of training to lie and fool people with eloquent speaking.
18 | Vic Madsen | 10154918112323812_10154918191698812 | I didn't hear her say she wanted to ban guns...i heard her say she wanta more regs and vetting of people who buy then...ie. no criminals. Mental people etc.
19 | Kandy Dennison | 10154918112323812_10154918167933812 | ABC NEW you should be ashamed of yourselves you're exactly what Trump was talking about it's very apparent who you want to win and it's not him ~ we don't need your opinion we the people can make up our own minds
20 | Dario Baptista | 10154918112323812_10154918146573812 | She's taking in Mothers and children that are living scared in Syria,I don't know what Trump Calls this but how bout the word Humane.
21 | France Eco | 10154918112323812_10154918152168812 | hillary and wallace done a good job... she had the composer and with class, unlike the pervert bully, disrespectful... he thought he's still in The Apprentice 😃
22 | Natasha Wright | 10154918112323812_10154918260353812 | Toddlers with guns because of poor parenting doesnt mean you take gun rights away from the masses who have their right to the 2nd Amendment. Hillary doesnt get this issue. But i like her stance on Pro-Choice. Thats the only thing I agree with her on
23 | Dannie Culver | 10154918112323812_10154918198073812 | When he called her a " nasty women " he as good as admitted that he has no respect for women. He made it easy to believe that he did everything those victims of his sexual misconduct said he did.
24 | Mercedes Biehl | 10154918112323812_10154918151903812 | No one cares about the average American anymore! Wake the hell up people! Stoo supporting these candidates! They don't care about us!
25 | Kathryn Nana Smith | 10154918112323812_10154918155823812 | Your awful facial expressions aren't working for you anymore Trump..........how dare you make those hateful comments about ripping a baby from a mothers womb during the 9th month of pregnancy........... Have you any idea how many women have died because of some nut case actually cutting a woman's baby out of her?!?!?!?!?! You make me sick Trump!!!!!!!!!!

Debate fact-check: Hillary Clinton said 17 intelligence agencies "confirmed" Russia is trying to influence the election. Grade: True. #Debates
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jonny Stevens | 10154918085013812_10154918089258812 | Sorry. Donald may be a Nutter, But Hilary Clinton is a Massive Liar, WOW you Country is Really Screwed... This Great Debate is embarrassing for America i Can't stop Laughing...LMAO...
2 | Amberlee Sunshine Tirrell | 10154918085013812_10154918103158812 | Yes and we must believe that its true because the media said they checked for us.. Lol I am just loving this. So many lies.. I love it. Make sure y'all vote and don't be stupid. Make your own choices.
3 | Linda Hunt Flanigan | 10154918085013812_10154918101333812 | Let's remind everyone The Russians didn't write the emails SHE DID. She likes you unaware. Don't stay that way.
4 | Jenny McFall Barnes | 10154918085013812_10154918105373812 | It has not been proven that the emails were hacked by Russia. What is amazing that nothing in the emails has been debunked and the main stream media have refused to report what is in them. Let's concentrate on what is in those emails. The democrat party is essentially the new mafia.
5 | Jorgen Pakieto | 10154918085013812_10154918088883812 | They are just insulting each other lol, It should be more detailed in arguments over who has the best strategy. Statements are rather largely more detailed on who has the best roast.
6 | Eric Brizendine | 10154918085013812_10154918099388812 | I'm voting for Hillary, but honestly, it doesn't matter who helped leak the documents as much as the content of said documents. Don't blame the source, blame the corruption .... on any side.
7 | Virginia Martini | 10154918085013812_10154918099438812 | I cannot take credit for this, as I'm not the original author, but thought it is too important not to share.ALL Of A Sudden....Seven Short Years Have Passed!Before Obama, There was virtually no outlandish presence of Islam in America.• All of a sudden, Islam is taught in schools. Christianity and the bible are banned in schools.• All of a sudden we must allow prayer rugs everywhere and allow for Islamic prayer in schools, airports, and businesses.• All of a sudden we must stop serving pork in prisons.• All of a sudden we are inundated with law suits by Muslims who are offended by American culture.• All of a sudden we must allow burkas to be worn everywhere even though you have no idea who or what is covered up under them.• All of a sudden Muslims are suing employers and refusing to do their jobs if they personally deem it conflicts with Sharia Law.• All of a sudden the Attorney General of the United States vows to prosecute anyone who engages in 'anti-Muslim speech'.• All of a sudden, Jihadists who engage in terrorism and openly admit they acted in the name of Islam and ISIS are emphatically declared they are NOT Islamic by our leaders and/or their actions are determined NOT to be terrorism, but other nebulous terms like 'workplace violence."• All of a sudden, it becomes Policy that Secular Middle East dictators that were benign or friendly to the West, must be replaced by Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood.• All of a sudden our troops are withdrawn from Iraq and the middle east, giving rise to ISIS.• All of a sudden, America has reduced its nuclear stockpiles to 1950 levels, as Obama's stated goal of a nuke-free America by the time he leaves office continues uninterrupted.• All of a sudden, a deal with Iran must be made at any cost, with a pathway to nuclear weapons and HUNDREDS of BILLIONS of dollars handed over to fund their programs.• All of a sudden America APOLOGIZES to Muslim states and sponsors of terror worldwide for acts of aggression, war, and sabotage THEY perpetrate against our soldiers.• All of a sudden, the American Navy is diminished to 1917 Pre-World War I levels Of only 300 ships. The Army is at pre-1940 levels. The Air Force scraps 500 planes and planned to retire the use of the A-10 Thunderbolt close air support fighter. A further draw down of another 40,000 military personnel is in progress.• All of a sudden half of our aircraft carriers are recalled for maintenance by Obama rendering the Atlantic unguarded, NONE are in the Middle East .• All of a sudden Obama has to empty Guantanamo Bay of captured Jihadists and let them loose in Jihad-friendly Islamic states. He demands to close the facility.• All of a sudden America will negotiate with terrorists and trade FIVE Taliban commanders for a deserter and Jihad sympathizer.• All of a sudden there is no money for American poor, disabled veterans, jobless Americans, hungry Americans, or displaced Americans but there is endless money for Obama's "Syrian refugee" resettlement Programs.• All of sudden there is an ammunition shortage in the USA.• All of a sudden, the most important thing for Obama to do after a mass shooting by two Jihadists, is disarm American citizens.• All of a sudden, the President of the United States cannot attend the Christian funerals of a Supreme Court Justice and a former First Lady because of previous (seemingly unimportant) commitments. **************************************************************************************************************All of a sudden, I’m sick to my stomach. I’m not sure the majority of Americans recognize the seriousness of the situation and how much “progress” has been made by Islam these last 7 years, a very brief time compared to a 75 year lifetime!🇺🇸 Yes, this IS Obama's legacy.
8 | Stephy Jo | 10154918085013812_10154918152998812 | So Donald's wrong if he says the election is rigged but then Hilary thinks Russia 🇷🇺 is throwing the election 😡and threw out her stupid conspiracy theory and that's good! Hmmm if Russia is helping Donald they're doing a poor job since your ahead in the polls Hilary.
9 | Gabriel Ashton Hazen | 10154918085013812_10154918348788812 | After watching the debate all I can say is that I am ashamed for the people of the USA.

10 | Roni Gutierrez King | 10154918085013812_10154918205058812 | Regardless if this is true or not. I have to agree with Trump about that Putin hates Hilary so much that if it is Russia doing it, it's not because they are doing it to support Trump but because they hate Hilary that much. That makes two countries that hate the Clintons and zero that hate Trump.So far Trump is leading in foreign relations and he's never held a political office.
11 | Aaron Hoilman | 10154918085013812_10154918087828812 | Coming from the same people that said she did nothing wrong with all the emails, right.
12 | Carol Michitson | 10154918085013812_10154918162233812 | Tina fact check her lies about her speeches on open borders and trade and spun off as an energy policy. She is a liar and would ramble on and on so she could run out the clock tonight.
13 | Viki Musselman | 10154918085013812_10154918166508812 | From everything to be actually found there's still no proof of Russia releasing hacked emails. Propaganda is being used with impunity. On Dec29 2012 Obama signed the bill making the use of propaganda on Americans legal once again, overturning the 1948 Smith-Mundt Act that had made propaganda illegal. Why would he do that?
14 | Jonny Stevens | 10154918085013812_10154918209018812 | What worry's me Most about America is they think its okay for the leader of there Country to LIE.....Lying to your OWN people is not Acceptable EVER..
15 | Zeny Maninang | 10154918085013812_10154918112248812 | Fact check. Trump said tremendous 50 times, disaster 100 times, very very repeated in unlimited times. 5th grader running for president.
16 | Jeanne Clevenger | 10154918085013812_10154918225163812 | I read a story today that the NSA is exposing the DNC's emails. I believe that there are still true Americans and they don't like the corruption and the fact that Hillary and Obama lied about Benghazi, let 4 Americans die, and covered it up by using the private server. I hope it is a true story. I don't think Russia did it.
17 | Sherry Shaffer Olson | 10154918085013812_10154918088103812 | Says who?? Obama is pushing that BS and he is in the position to do so.
18 | Charlie Jedi-Prick Boggus | 10154918085013812_10154918168578812 | I'm a Cyber Security specialist with the DOD, and no one said it WAS Russia.
19 | James Funaro | 10154918085013812_10154918106848812 | Russia trying to influence the election via exposing the truth, fact!
20 | Kayla Lastof | 10154918085013812_10154918112203812 | These 17 intelligent agencies are in her pocket. The media is in her pocket. Of course they're going to side with crooked clinton
21 | Lynn Helms Runnion | 10154918085013812_10154918167663812 | Yes, we can agree that Russia hacked to get the information.  BUT, GUESS WHAT, they hacked the DNC and Hillary's illegal server that had classified information on it, that was illegal to have and that she lied about.  So I ask, "what difference does it make" who hacked it?? At least we are finding out what a corrupt liar she is and how the politicians are manipulating us and OUR government!!!!
22 | Jay Sabawoon | 10154918085013812_10154918111913812 | Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."
