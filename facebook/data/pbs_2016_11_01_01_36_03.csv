How much of an effect is the FBI news having on the last days of the presidential race?

1 | RL Grimm | 26 | 10154720630668675_10154721080453675 | Even though Trump has no experience in actual political work, painfully obviously so, we have to look at his past and critically scrutinize it as much as the other side has been. Also, I’m sorry but not having experience in the political arena isn’t a plus for Trump, if anything it’s a staunch warning as to how he will handle things as POTUS. Like it or not experience means a lot in the world. We don’t tend to trust people with little to no experience in a lot of aspects of our lives. We don’t want someone to prepare our taxes that hasn’t ever prepared and filed one for themselves. We wouldn’t want someone to build us a house that never built one before. We wouldn’t want a doctor who has never been to medical school to give us medical advice. We wouldn’t want to follow a military grunt into combat with no combat experience compared to a battle hardened marine with five years experience in active combat. We tend to trust those with experience over those with little or none, especially ones that have made mistakes because they have learned the ins and outs of the job at hand. That being said, can a person make mistakes that have severe consequences? The answer is yes and can ruin everything in their life. Since you seem to think the mistakes that Hillary has made should ruin everything in her life then we should look at Trump’s record in the same scrutiny.Donald Trump has been married three times. His first marriage was in 1977, to Czech born Ivana Zelníčková, who said in their divorce deposition that Donald had 'raped' her. She later clarified that she meant she felt violated, not that he had raped her in a 'legal' sense. Though, Ivana described a harrowing scene in which Trump held her arms back, pulled at her hair, and raped her in a fit of rage. She herself used the word “rape.” The details of the incident were made public in the 1993 book Lost Tycoon. Trump denies this incident took place, and before the book hit shelves his lawyers required that it include a statement at the front written by Ivana, in which she walks back her use of the word “rape.”During his marriage to Ivana, Trump had an affair with Marla Maples, who he married in 1993, after Maples gave birth to their daughter.In 1998 Trump began his relationship with his third and current wife Melania. The pair got married in 2005. Now let’s look at the things Trump has said and done so we can get a sense of what this man stands for. Another accusation of sexual assault comes from a 1997 lawsuit. Jill Harth says she and her romantic partner were working with Trump on a business deal, when The Donald started making unwelcome sexual advances. In a lawsuit filed against Trump, she says he leered at her inappropriately, groped her on several occasions without her consent, and even “attempted rape.”Trump denies any of this ever happened, calling the allegations “meritless.” While Harth withdrew her lawsuit shortly after Trump settled a separate lawsuit with her romantic partner over a business matter, she stands by her claims. (Harth and Trump had a cordial relationship until recently, when the allegations resurfaced and he denied them. At that point, according to The Guardian, Harth decided to speak out.) She also says Trump’s camp has contacted her on several occasions in an attempt to make her change her story and deny it ever happened. “I said I’m not doing that,” she told The Guardian.The newest case against Trump comes via a recent federal lawsuit filed in June 2016 in the State of New York by “Jane Doe.” In the suit, Doe alleges that Trump raped her back in 1994, when she was just 13 years old. According to legal docs, Doe says she attended parties with Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein—a registered sex offender known in the media as the “billionaire pedophile.” Doe, who was trying to become a model, says it was during these parties that Trump initiated sexual contact with her on several occasions and on one occasion allegedly raped her. According to the suit, Trump tied her to a bed, exposed himself to her and then raped her in a “savage sexual attack.” Doe says she screamed for him to stop at which point he struck her in the face while screaming “that he would do whatever he wanted.” In a statement filed with the lawsuit, Doe says Trump threatened to ruin her life and her family’s life if she ever told anyone about the incident. The lawsuit also includes a witness statement from a “Tiffany Doe,” who says that, in the ’90s, she was in charge of recruiting adolescent women to entertain guests at Epstein’s parties—and she personally saw the incident occur. I personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform various sexual acts with Donald J. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were advised that she was 13 years old. In her statement, Tiffany Doe also says she witnessed Trump force other minors to perform oral sex on him and witnessed his “physical abuse” on them “when they finished the act.” According to documents, Trump has denied the allegations, stating “These allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level and clearly framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated. There is absolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.”A 1994 episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous in which Trump Speculated about his one-year-old daughter’s future breasts when Robin Leach asked Trump and his then-wife Marla Maples what attributes their infant daughter inherited from her parents.In 2006, Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka appeared on ABC’s “The View” to promote their TV show “The Apprentice.” He said, “If Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her.”1997 Trump publicly shamed a Miss Universe winner, Alicia Machado, for gaining weightIn 1997, Temple Taggart, Miss Utah told the Times “He kissed me directly on the lips. I thought, 'Oh my God, gross. He was married to Marla Maples at the time. I think there were a few other girls that he kissed on the mouth. I was like 'Wow, that's inappropriate.”There is a hell of a lot more but you get the picture. I really get tired of the crap that we should vote for Trump without vetting him because he isn’t a politician and that wouldn’t be fair. We should just blindly follow Trump because the other side is so much worse is asinine. Why is deflecting an answer? Why can’t Trump stand on his own policies and merits? I’m not a fan of Hillary but I will be voting for her over Trump in the hopes we will have a better candidate running in four years that we all can vote for.

Especially since today, I heard that they don't think they'll release anything until after the elections. Suspicious? Do your investigation the first time in an efficient manner and then we don't have these issues later on. How in-depth are they? 4 tries at getting someone!
3 | Lynn Lavorgna McCrea | 18 | 10154720630668675_10154721089563675 | This is a very sick attempt to undermine Hillary...and her  quest for a historic presidency.... Hillary will survive,.this whole fiasco is outrageous..Comey deserves to be fired..and charges  brought to haul him into court..STAT
4 | Lisa Gonner | 6 | 10154720630668675_10154721095943675 | Yes, we're behind Hillary! People are so sick of drumpf - his false accusations, his unprincipled ways, his cruel nature, his bombastic personality, his narcissistic show boating every chance he gets. We're so tired of this Wiki guy, and appalled that Russia would be able to infiltrate and disrupt our election process, and we can't help but continue to question what the connection is that Trump claimed, and then denied, between himself and Russia? And on top of that - to have the head of the FBI purposely throw himself into the middle of this extremely important election 10 days before the election - unbelievable!! - where's the integrity? We want to go on with our lives - we want to forego the daily chaos. We long for some peace and quiet.
5 | Michele A Wilcox | 10 | 10154720630668675_10154721168723675 | I already voted for Hillary. I don't give a rip about emails that proved absolutely nothing. To keep regurgitating this garbage over and over again is pretty asinine.
6 | Malinda Mindy Murphy Brannan | 6 | 10154720630668675_10154721093223675 | Best thing anyone can do this time around is research both, weed out the bull, decide what YOU want in a president, which person values are closest to yours and stop watching the news.
7 | Eric Moss | 2 | 10154720630668675_10154721111153675 | These emails are not as important as the leaked Podesta emails, where there is frank discussion of privatizing Social Security, nominating Republican Supreme Court Justices, and passing TPP.  Trump is up-front about destroying the New Deal, which is an awful thing, but Clinton's big Wall Street backers are trying to do the same thing.  Bernie has his work cut out for him pressuring Clinton to not do it.

The ObombA-Clintonian Coalition OF PERDITION have by admission and behavior openly defied and denied Judeo-Christianity and Jesus Christ God Almighty, the Lord and Saviour of humanity. Their SUBVERSIVE TYRANNY through manipulation and Indoctrination has choked the life out of the AMERICAN  IDEOLOGY and is Dividing the Citizenry to be conquered internally and externally.To this end God help us and TRUMP move LEFT TO CENTER !

1 | Robert Rankin | 4 | 10154720627998675_10154720808348675 | Yes...when Brazile was giving Hillary Clinton the questions to the second debate. Then after the debate, the only thing the liberals could talk about was how Trump was hovering over Clinton. It kinda reminds me of how the democrats was accusing Trump of inciting violence, when all along it was Hillary Clinton that was hiring people to start the violence. They go low we go high. Ha! what a joke.
2 | Paul Botts | 0 | 10154720627998675_10154720906318675 | Voting for the same two parties decade after decade expecting a different result is stupid!The first requirement for a candidate is integrity neither Clinton or Trump have it.
3 | James Nelson | 0 | 10154720627998675_10154720887653675 | STEP 1)    Poisoning the wellPoisoning the well (or attempting to poison the well) is a fallacy where irrelevant adverse information about a target is preemptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that the target person is about to say. Poisoning the well can take the form of an (explicit or implied) argument, and is considered by some philosophers an informal fallacy.A poisoned-well "argument" has the following form:1. Unfavorable information (Hillary’s emails) (be it true or false) about person A (Hillary)is presented by another (Comey & the GOP). (e.g. "Before you listen to my opponent, may I remind you that he has been in jail")2. Therefore, the claims made by person A will be false. I have seen this tactic used by American lawyers many times in my career.  During or just before a big case is to be made the attorneys will poison the well against their opponents merely to discredit them.However, there is never any thought about defending the false allegations in the court of law; only in the court of public opinion.Don’t be fooled!!!
4 | George Adams | 1 | 10154720627998675_10154720819688675 | STOP Election Fraud: Do NOT use Soros voting machines. Please vote to put Billery/Killery on trial for TREASON. She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleading the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovereignty of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump. Ask yourself who is helping Hillery with the cover up and why...We want our country back!

There has been a lot of criticism directed at FBI Director James Comey for what he did on Friday. What motivated him to write to Congress?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Eileen Ward | 52 | 10154720615808675_10154720681563675 | He's. A Trump man. Probably got paid to do it this week so there wouldn't be time to clear things up. Hang him from a flag pole upside down so his 30 pieces of silver (or the modern equivalent) will fall out of his pockets
2 | James Nelson | 34 | 10154720615808675_10154720670928675 | STEP 1)    Poisoning the wellPoisoning the well (or attempting to poison the well) is a fallacy where irrelevant adverse information about a target is preemptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that the target person is about to say. Poisoning the well can take the form of an (explicit or implied) argument, and is considered by some philosophers an informal fallacy.A poisoned-well "argument" has the following form:1. Unfavorable information (Hillary’s emails) (be it true or false) about person A (Hillary)is presented by another (Comey & the GOP). (e.g. "Before you listen to my opponent, may I remind you that he has been in jail")2. Therefore, the claims made by person A will be false. I have seen this tactic used by American lawyers many times in my career.  During or just before a big case is to be made the attorneys will poison the well against their opponents merely to discredit them.However, there is never any thought about defending the false allegations in the court of law; only in the court of public opinion.Don’t be fooled!!!
3 | John L Gower | 24 | 10154720615808675_10154720713828675 | What is  republican Comey's motive?    Smearing the Democratic nominee 10 days out from the election with some kind of vague statement about someone else's emails.
4 | Ed Weigandt | 22 | 10154720615808675_10154720702538675 | BETTER QUESTION: What motivated Rep. Jason Chaffetz to tweet/leak out the letter Comey wrote then state that the email server investigation was re-opened? If anyone should be investigated for violating the Hatch Act it should be Jason Chaffetz.
5 | Yoritomo Jiriki | 16 | 10154720615808675_10154720677718675 | The reason? Rep. Jason Chaffitz. It's not a coincidence that Chaffitz flip flops and votes for Trump after saying he can't and this coming out the next day.

7 | Kenneth Viste | 3 | 10154720615808675_10154720972848675 | When is some news organization going to point out that the email "scandal" is a hoax. What crime other than deliberately passing classified material to unauthorized people? All they are going to find is some clerk or staff member mislabeling or wrongly forwarding something. That is hardly worthy of panic obsession with emails that clutters up news programs and pages.
8 | Parul Sharma | 7 | 10154720615808675_10154720713348675 | So basically it's much ado about nothing . The only statement is that Comey must have made taht decision because there has to be  soemthing substantial or else he would not done something so big. I decline the premise that Comey is an ethical and moral man. Why would you inform Congress if you have not even legal permission to read these emails. I mean warrant was taken before that. So what was the premise for that warrants urgency? Maybe Trump is right. Judges, FBI director and the entire machinery is doomed
9 | Kenneth Viste | 0 | 10154720615808675_10154720954708675 | One of the news pieces that come up when I go on the internet was of the daughter of Trump boasting that her father pressured Comey to act. I don't know how reliable that was and I saw it only once. Thought it interesting.
10 | Humberto Capiro | 2 | 10154720615808675_10154720778778675 | So the Justice Department could have stopped FBI director Comey but they did not. They chose instead to criticize him for not following their recommendations.  Very strange!!
11 | Kristi McArthur | 0 | 10154720615808675_10154720814443675 | Obviously you would have to have some pretty circumstantial evidence to just reopen an FBI case days before the FBI election so while you Clinton bots ( aka ctr) ragging on Comey you wouldn't have just done this for no reason so many days before the election obviously it's important
12 | Art Mills | 5 | 10154720615808675_10154720730558675 | There is no justification whatsoever for Comey's talking with the House about an investigation. He is not accountable to them and has an absolute obligation to maintain confidentiality until he charges are filed, and only then in the context of the trial!
13 | Dirk Willard | 1 | 10154720615808675_10154720796708675 | Fun watching Clinton's trolls at work. The zombie voters, the Clintonites just lap it up.Here goes. I will add my speculation to the mix. Comey probably got fed up with obstruction by the Obama administration ordered by the Clinton machine. The FBI was behind taking down Nixon but not in the way you imagined. It was Mark Felt, the number two at the FBI, AKA "Deep Throat" that guided Woodward and Bernstein at the Washington Post. Felt's identity was kept secret until he died; when he was outed by Woodward, an uproar from the conservatives insisted he was a traitor: he was a patriot. Even then, it must be remembered that Felt had his own agenda: he wanted to save the agency from the embarrassment of going along with Nixon's plumbers. Heroes must be allowed their own agendas.My only hope now is that we can quickly come to terms. It took two years for the Democrats and Republicans to put down their lances. I would like to see the Democrats and Republicans meet and decide that Hillary must not be allowed to take this country down that dark path we traveled during Watergate.
14 | Harry Brewick | 0 | 10154720615808675_10154720937628675 | FBI says 650,000 e-mails found on the perverts laptop, Huma Abedin claims she never used the laptop... It would take someone using the laptop 5 years, 365 days a year and sending or receiving 350 e-mails everyday... Does the FBI really think that this "FIND" is not a bit STRANGE??
15 | Sj Lag | 0 | 10154720615808675_10154721110298675 | Loretta Lynch can't complain she could have ordered the FBI Director Not to inform Congress, but then that would be even worse because She's the one that entertained Bill Clinton one week before Hillary's deposition with the FBI. Huma can clear up everything and release her Emails Herself tomorrow. She and Anthony Weiner hid the laptop from the earlier probe because of his bad sexual behavior on that laptop. Hopefully Huma will not end up in trouble all because of Hillary Clinton's e-mails. No one to blame for this but Hillary she chose to have a private server in the first place everything else is unintended consequences.
16 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 2 | 10154720615808675_10154720731743675 | What is of great concern is thatFBI Director James Comey argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the FBI's name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out, a former bureau official tells CNBC.The official said some government insiders are perplexed as to why Comey would have election timing concerns with the Russian disclosure but not with the Huma Abedin email discovery disclosure he made Friday.In the end, the Department of Homeland Security and The Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued the statement on Oct. 7, saying: "The U.S. intelligence community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations. ... These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.
17 | Janet Fredmund Kuplinski | 0 | 10154720615808675_10154721104548675 | Perhaps when his Republican peers trounced on him for not charging Hillary in the first investigation he decided to get back in their good graces by pulling this stunt.
18 | Christopher Keene | 0 | 10154720615808675_10154720995698675 | What he did at the very least was unethical. And as a voter i don't understand how he could do this without knowing that this would unfairly influence some voter unjustly as to misinform voters as if there were proven legal facts that would implement Hillary Clinton. It is not up to F.B.I. Director James Comley to be Judge , Jury and Prosecutor. This is not the Soviet Union.
19 | Elenna Larsen | 12 | 10154720615808675_10154720671733675 | This guy has to go....Wonder what "the Donald" has promised him?$?$?
20 | Bryan Chris | 1 | 10154720615808675_10154721026668675 | Meanwhile Clinton gets repeatedly caught cheating in debates and manipulating the press and the DNC is caught tossing ballots while lead by two consecutive leaders caught working as agents for Clinton...But let's whine some more about Comey discussing his investigation when it's politically inconvenient?You can ignore it all you want. But it's hard to write things off as conspiracy theories when the evidence is right in front of you.She should never have been the nominee, and if the DNC were truly impartial they would've reconsidered her entire candidacy, given the massive damage its done, creating an entire movement of progressives who now refuse to fall in line with DNC corruption.
21 | Robin Friday | 1 | 10154720615808675_10154720814668675 | I believe that he is an honest man but he allowed his own self-righteousness to carry him away. The dichotomy between his forthrightness with the Clinton question and his reluctance in the earlier instance with Trump is not making logical sense and illustrates that he has allowed his self-image to betray him and lead him into hypocrisy.
22 | Brian Boehm | 5 | 10154720615808675_10154720735413675 | Since June Comey has known about a 5 year relationship between the Kremlin and Drumpf so naturally he wants to talk about emails concerning d*ck pics

Anger about the economy has played a leading role in the 2016 race, whether it's related to trade, student debt or the aftermath of the Great Recession.

She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleading the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovereignty of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump. Ask yourself who is helping Hillery with the cover up and why...We want our country back!

Hormone injections for men have proven to be an effective birth control method, according to a recent study.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Aneetha Trikur | 72 | 10154719396558675_10154720142183675 | "Mood disorders, depression, acne "Sounds like PMS to me which women suffer every month. And the guys dropped out? Wimps!!
2 | Lynn K Luckeroth | 61 | 10154719396558675_10154720126703675 | Women have been dealing with side effects too...some even died from clots or heart attacks...it's a good thing that men share the responsibility.
3 | Ashley Connell | 9 | 10154719396558675_10154720665523675 | Copied from a friend Alisha Mitchell  but she said it better than I can: There have been a lot of posts about the male hormonal birth control trials that ended due to  common side effects women have been enduring since the pill was invented. As much as I super love to tease men for being babies, I do want to point out that from the study I read that not only was the male birth control shot significantly less effective than female contraceptives (about 96% for male, compared to the 99.9% females enjoy), one participant committed suicide in the study, and another attempted suicide, as well as the shot causing some participants to not regain total fertility for up to one year, some did not regain normal fertility even after four years. Basically, they are adjusting the drug because it is not effective enough, and has side effects that are not worth the benefits it provides. Now. I think female birth control definitely has a lot of issues, however, women do have a vast variety to chose from (if their insurance is inclined to cover it). The study results showed the participants would prefer a pill form rather than injection, much like many women prefer in their BC. So it isn't like a little acne or moodiness is making them hate the idea of male BC, they just want similar options with side effects that may not result in suicide or sterility. Ok, I'm off my soapbox, #birthcontrolforall!
4 | Stan Aylsworth | 9 | 10154719396558675_10154720226743675 | Realistically, 96% IS NOT "nearly 100% effective" when it comes to birth-control.That's a pregnancy 4 out of a 100 goes or 2 out of 50 or 1 out of 25... Not great odds really.If it rains, wear a raincoat. Wrap it.
5 | Claire Laskowski | 4 | 10154719396558675_10154720665108675 | I find it difficult to be objective about these side effects. If you want to talk side effects try taking the birth control pills women have been taking for decades. Strange it's ok for women to suffer through them but, God forbid, men should have to deal with side effects, too.
6 | Eileen Ward | 2 | 10154719396558675_10154720277433675 | I don't think we'll see a run on appointments BUT if a single guy wants to be sure or at least 96% sure it could be worth it to them not to become a father but I think it's the same percentage as a condom and they protect you from STD's too
7 | Gwyn Richard | 6 | 10154719396558675_10154720297758675 | Wonderful advances in medicine. I am sure many men would find this useful. And it would be very helpful to couples if both sides were doing their best to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
8 | Sheila Defazio | 2 | 10154719396558675_10154720523148675 | So do you think women's contraceptives don't have side effects? Seriously read the warnings on a package of birth control pills...it's going to be hard to get men to prevent something they haven't worked real hard at preventing in the first place...
9 | Elaine Lawler | 25 | 10154719396558675_10154720219243675 | Side effects are only acceptable for women? I'm holding up a finger - guess which one.
10 | Mark Maseeh | 0 | 10154719396558675_10154721117273675 | Synthetic hormones are never a good thing. These are not real bio-identical hormones, but instead are man made and can cause serious life threatening side effects.
11 | Moani Ke'ala Alverio | 0 | 10154719396558675_10154721057663675 | I don't feel sorry at all. Not all men but some expect their partners to get snipped after having kids, when most themselves won't do it. I'm not saying our awesome guys should suffer, but I think a guy got some big cahones to step up and try it. Every bcp works differently on women it might with the guys, so Guys, give it a go. Some already use viagara and that's brave! Knowing the side effect for viagara is death. Can't deal yet?  Why don't both of you get snipped? Then both of you get some needed after surgery chill time at home. What I don't get is how men let women go through depression, weight gain (then try and leave women for it when the man himself ask his partner to get on the pull), etc. If you are a brave male and would try it or something better, say I WOULD!!! Or else push scientists to come up with a bcp that has no side effects. What man will stand up once and for all for every mother, sister, friend and fix the problem for us women? WHO will finally stand? If no one will, try it guys.
12 | Mona Thornton | 8 | 10154719396558675_10154720238608675 | But men either won't do it because they are inherently babies and will complaining about the side effects; or can't be trusted ( unless they are in a committed relationship).
13 | Jeffrey Kelley | 0 | 10154719396558675_10154720137863675 | I wouldnt want this. Women have hormonal BC and it can adversely effect them in many ways. I wouldn't want that happening to me or anyone else.  I would rather wait for Vasalgel...which is an injection of a gel into the vas deferense. It is reversed by removing the gel.

16 | Alexandra Allwein | 7 | 10154719396558675_10154720196008675 | "Mood disorders, depression, acne and other side effects" wow... jeez that must be TERRIBLE!! Lmao men are weak and wack af
17 | Sarah L Mattingly | 1 | 10154719396558675_10154720619773675 | Female contraception also has side effects. I wonder if men will be willing to put up with them.
18 | Sam Lynch | 1 | 10154719396558675_10154720772273675 | Well, there only 96% effective. 4 percentage points is a big deal the medical profession.
19 | Erin Forta | 4 | 10154719396558675_10154720146063675 | Most of these side effects also happen to women on hormonal birth control. This is not surprising to me at all.
20 | Felicia Diamond | 0 | 10154719396558675_10154720802033675 | Side effects like the ones women deal with. *dead pan looks at the camera*

Here's hoping we get lots of milk chocolate in our trick-or-treat bags tonight. (from The Atlantic)
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Stephen Lloyd | 46 | 10154719964783675_10154720111673675 | Depends. British, Belgian and German milk chocolate is usually good. American milk chocolate tastes like wax. I prefer dark overall though because it's not as sweet and tastes more, well, chocolaty.
2 | Cydnee White | 27 | 10154719964783675_10154720049503675 | I prefer dark, but I wouldn't say it was "better". Why say "better" instead of "I prefer"? I think it's because people who think if you disagree with their preference, you are wrong, are insecure.
3 | James Parson | 5 | 10154719964783675_10154720361118675 | Interesting. I have always way preferred dark chocolate, but that might also just be because it's incredibly rare for me to have a sweet tooth.If ya wanna talk about chalky texture, grab some of that Hershey's...
4 | Gerard Thomas | 6 | 10154719964783675_10154720200013675 | One of  my biggest regrets is my daughters outgrowing Trick or Treat,,and trying to track down all those peanut butter cups, Snickers and Mr. Goodbars which so mysteriously disappeared....
5 | Peggy Slemp | 5 | 10154719964783675_10154720306708675 | Personally, I hate the taste of Hershey's. It makes my throat feel irritated. Belgian, Swiss and German chocolate are usually great-smooth, whether milk or dark, I love both, but I like dark best.
6 | Carolyn Buon-Cristiani | 0 | 10154719964783675_10154721041113675 | Belgian, and only Belgian, Dark Chocolate.That's it.If you are comparing chocolates by peeling the foil off those teeny American made Hershey bars, you have not lived. And don't talk to me about expensively wrapped bars or those with high "solid" content. I consume mass quantities, and it's gotta be good. Belgian.
7 | Terry Reynolds | 2 | 10154719964783675_10154720481028675 | In addition to tasting like real chocolate instead of some weak imitation Dark chocolate has health benefits that milk c. doesn't.
8 | Claire Costello | 0 | 10154719964783675_10154720860423675 | OMG! Would someone please tell MOMs, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and every major drug store and grocery chain. It's so hard to find organic milk chocolate any more.
9 | George Fredlund | 3 | 10154719964783675_10154720601998675 | Hershey's really does not contain enough cocoa butter to be called chocolate. It can be called a confection. 85 to 90% rule!
10 | Rochelle Moore | 0 | 10154719964783675_10154721080993675 | 💜💜I said better because doctors and nutritionists have said dark chocolate is more heart healthy than milk chocolate.I like them both I was just making a statement about what I have read about the two. Do ,t make a federal case out of it!
11 | Connie Thompson Jones | 0 | 10154719964783675_10154720556453675 | Nope .... Wrong..... Lol... Just my opinion on savory dark chocolate. Dark chocolate can be savored with coffee , red wine, and brandy when a girl needs a comforting friend
12 | Nicky Leach | 3 | 10154719964783675_10154720155068675 | Dark is too stimulating for me, as I have health issues; however, good quality milk chocolate I can do. Green and Blacks is very good, with organic sugar.
13 | Gary DiNardo | 1 | 10154719964783675_10154720322283675 | After seeing ANY of the dozens of videos taken in dairies by Mercy For Animals undercover investigators, a decent person will want to stay away from any 'milk' chocolate.
14 | Steve Scearce | 6 | 10154719964783675_10154720164908675 | Sacrilege! Repent, sinner! Your penance? Eat a Green & Black's Organic Dark Chocolate, 70% Cacao and tell me it isn't fantastic.
15 | Duane G. Jamison | 0 | 10154719964783675_10154721016473675 | I had 4 children stop for candy, too bad I bought peppermint patties and dark chocolate kisses...guess I'll have to eat them myself
16 | Lani Teshima | 6 | 10154719964783675_10154720115713675 | That's like saying stale vomit is better than filet mignon. Just crazy talk designed to drive Internet traffic!!
17 | Alexander Arnote | 7 | 10154719964783675_10154720123728675 | Milk chocolate in Europe is way better than American so you need to define where they are talking about
18 | Mike Guay | 4 | 10154719964783675_10154720063128675 | PBS NewsHourJudging by the comments, you've jumped the shark on this one. Lol
19 | Alexander Molisana | 2 | 10154719964783675_10154720110863675 | Chocolate is only good for you in moderation and only if it's "organic ". All major brands of chocolate and candy we get nowadays are full of GMO's
20 | Larry Moffett | 4 | 10154719964783675_10154720094793675 | That's not an indictment of dark chocolate but of Hershey's dark chocolate, which tastes like cardboard.
21 | Trish Feldmann | 0 | 10154719964783675_10154720903028675 | I am incredibly dismayed that not one person on this site is concerned about promoting Hershey ' chocolate. They purchase their ingredients from purveyors that practice child slave labor to harvest
22 | Matthew Roy | 0 | 10154719964783675_10154720810403675 | i disagree. but i am impressed the atlantic is letting a six year old write a column.
23 | Julie Newell | 0 | 10154719964783675_10154720319428675 | So pretty much I could just trade this author all the stuff I like least for most of the stuff I like best. Except Snickers; I'm keeping my Snickers.
24 | Karen Michelle Yarbrough | 0 | 10154719964783675_10154720384338675 | No way.milk chocolate is full of sugar..dark is well..a vegetable..hehe
25 | William H Boley | 3 | 10154719964783675_10154720015753675 | It's both/and, not either/or, when it comes to debates about different types of chocolate.

Climate change is a gradual process, driven by invisible pollution. So it can be hard to wrap your brain around. But these scientists have made it possible to listen to the planet changing. (from KUOW Public Radio)
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Cere Penry Gatlin | 1 | 10154719562438675_10154720156013675 | I am 58 years old. I have been hit over my head with climate change and pollution control my entire life. I can remember learning Pollution songs in first grade!  Our government -- democrats and republicans have had many many chances to get us away from fossil fuels. They won't do it. Way too much $$ in special interests. They don't WANT us to be free. The USA has been regulated to death and yet we turn a blind eye to India and China -- the worlds greatest polluter. We could have been using diesel made from trash decades ago but they won't let us.
2 | Jared Mathew | 3 | 10154719562438675_10154719799583675 | Lmao. These are computer models that have already been proven to be programmed in a bias manner. You're better off studying sun cycles, volcanic activity, and tectonic plate activity. If you're looking for pollution that's easily monitored. And our air quality is better than it was 40 years ago.
3 | Brian McChesney | 1 | 10154719562438675_10154720010473675 | Agenda 21... Sustainability... need less humans...Global Warming kills = less humans.Encourage Global Warming in support of Human Sustainability.Understand your Politically-driven Science.
4 | Antilusional | 0 | 10154719562438675_10154720843198675 | Climate change is real! Global warming is real! They have been keeping records, and very recently, all time warming records have been broken again, and again!That, in itself isn't up for debate! Evidence is not debatable. And observation is an observation. Those aren't opinions. They are measurements. Anyone choosing to turn that in itself into a fight and battle, doesn't have a leg to stand on. The thing about science (aka, evidence based study), is that it is true, whether or not you believe in it.

Democrats are relying on winning Illinois as they look to regain control of the Senate.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Marta Goodman | 72 | 10154719555563675_10154719766498675 | We have way too many crazy geezers in the Senate! How about John McCain who shamelessly declares the continuation of the obstructionism by Republicans in Washington if Clinton wins? How can anybody be OK with that? Haven't eight years been enough?Geezers out!
2 | Sheila Jaskie | 55 | 10154719555563675_10154719749448675 | Republican FL Senator Rubio recently submitted a bill to force women to give birth to Zika babies.   If you have the Zika virus (which stays in your body 180 days) you will not get an abortion if Rubio has his way.   Please vote Blue all the way down the ticket to keep the Republican agenda out of women's bodies.
3 | Judy Epp-Kelsey | 16 | 10154719555563675_10154719740508675 | You see?  Why would you do something like that when its so important to your party that you get re-elected?  They just sabotage themselves, like Ved Lekic says, showing their true colors.
4 | Ved Lekic | 33 | 10154719555563675_10154719723963675 | He showed his true racist colors. Disgrace. Get him out of the Senate
5 | Wally McQuade | 1 | 10154719555563675_10154720063388675 | Some people have spent too long in Washington.  It's just a matter of time until the public interests are disregarded for special interests.Mitch McConnellHarry ReidJohn McCainJohn KerryHillary Clintonand others from both parties should be voted out of Washington.
6 | Sally Grey Weeks | 2 | 10154719555563675_10154719879163675 | Ah.. so much political clean-up to do... and new nuts campaigning all the time. With all the mud-slinging, it's a wonder any honest person ever WANTS to run for office. That's a bad turn for our country.
7 | Kelly Jenkins | 0 | 10154719555563675_10154720563733675 | Ok people check this out my husband has lived here for 14 years, he bought this house from his family which are now deceased and have been for MANY years like 20 years I just checked the mail and we have mail from the Democratic Party wanting their votes these people are deceased have been for 20 years now you tell me they aren't using the deceased for votes!!!!! How Messed Up Is This!!!!!!!
8 | Melanie Weiss | 0 | 10154719555563675_10154721190098675 | It was a totally inappropriate and uncalled for comment and is typical of the hubris of some Republicans and Trump supporters, who feel they can say anything with no repercussions. It was especially disrespectful from someone who served in the Armed Forces to someone who made a far greater sacrifice than he did.
9 | Delores Sylvester | 0 | 10154719555563675_10154720096853675 | That remark certainly helped her down here where she didn't respond to PJStar for an interview that resulted in them endorsing Kirk instead.
10 | Sheryl Fitzgerald | 2 | 10154719555563675_10154720364608675 | good. But the best reason to not reelect him is because he spent the last eight years not doing his job by obstructing EVERYTHING. Besides Tammie is much better and an actual war hero. Already gleefully voted for her. bye Marky.

13 | Lynda Bauer | 11 | 10154719555563675_10154719787538675 | Sometimes 'sorry' just doesn't cut it when you've shown your true, base character and attitude.

15 | Bryan Evans | 1 | 10154719555563675_10154719898888675 | In case you didn't notice having a Democratic president didn't really have that much impact on actual policy. Same shyte, different administration.

17 | Marcia Tanabe | 0 | 10154719555563675_10154720797498675 | Had enough of scandals?  A vote for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka and the Green Party is a vote for a viable multi-party democracy going forward."Just 5 percent of the national vote for the Green Party Stein/Baraka ticket can be a true game-changer for American politics. It will qualify the Green Party for recognition as an official national party, and for federal funding in the 2020 presidential race proportional to the amount of votes received — at least $8 million to $10 million. It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state). It means the party can leap over the undemocratic barriers to ballot access for independent parties in many states, and help us lay the groundwork for a truly competitive challenge to the two-party system and the corporate rule it perpetuates." A majority of Americans are disgusted with the political farce we are enduring. They are desperate for a principled alternative to the predatory bipartisan establishment, and seek a positive path out of the two-party trap. Investing your vote in a 5-percent victory for the Green Party can make it happen.” -- Jill SteinThird Party Presidential Forum:One week before what’s shaping up to be an historic presidential election, Tavis Smiley on PBS will host a presidential forum featuring the third party candidates, Jill Stein of the Green Party and Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party.This forum will be taped live Monday, October 31, 2016, in the show’s Los Angeles studio and air on Tavis Smiley over two nights next week on Mondayevening and Tuesday, November 1 on PBS. An additional thirty (30) minute conversation, with questions selected entirely from social media will be available exclusively online at the Tavis Smiley PBS website.Viewers may submit questions to the candidates via Twitter, Instagram and Facebook using the hashtags: #TavisSmileyForum, #AskJill or #AskGary.

Hear what Clinton and Trump supporters are telling Judy Woodruff. Join us for more from the campaign trail on tonight's PBS NewsHour.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lynda Young | 208 | 10154719414203675_10154719537768675 | It's the well spoken well informed Clinton supporters and then we have the strange people supporting Trump because his name is on a building or he's going to close the border according to a woman who is clearly an immigrant herself. Just wow.
2 | Dan Wight | 142 | 10154719414203675_10154719502993675 | I wonder what Trump supporters would say if they knew he has laundered hundreds of millions of dollars for Russian connections through his real estate endeavors.
3 | Ruth Anne Byrns | 57 | 10154719414203675_10154719551053675 | The clear difference in the level of intelligence says it all. One group is thoughtful and articulate, and the other is quite simply dumber than dirt.
4 | Suzanne Allen Crabtree | 26 | 10154719414203675_10154719556723675 | Trump's been in 4,056 lawsuits, and found guilty of breaking federal law 237 times. He's currently under investigation for:1. Illegally using his charity for personal legal fees and fines.2. Trump University- fraud, racketeering, and misrepresentation.3. Raping a 13 yr old girl. Trial brings Dec. 16, 2016. Case 1:16-cv-04642 Filed 06/20/16.4. Illegally paying off the Florida Attorney General to avoid being investigated for Trump University.5. Illegally violating US laws under the Cuba embargo.And, he's been found guilty of rape 4 times and sexual assault 20 times, all of which he negotiated a plea deal to pay the women off.Most comprehensive research on Trump's lawsuits and criminal indictments:http://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/trump-lawsuits/
5 | Ellen Jo Hillis Tate | 29 | 10154719414203675_10154719508798675 | I guess you could hit some of these people in the face with the fact that getting money from Chinese and Russians IS foreign influence and they wouldn't believe it. That is Donald Trump in spades! So sad.
6 | Linda Booher Brooks | 20 | 10154719414203675_10154719694928675 | I wish with all me heart all of the noise would just get out of her way and let her be herself. She will make an excellent president. You go Hillary Clinton in 2016
7 | Luly Betancourt | 26 | 10154719414203675_10154719507318675 | The older blond lady with the heavy accent in support of Trump is ironically missing that she, herself is a foreigner! What if Trump decided that whatever her origin is should be deported?! How stupid some people can be is mind boggling.
8 | Susan Means Rosenberg | 12 | 10154719414203675_10154719694508675 | The people who spoke in support of HIllary seem so smart, knowledgeable...educated.  The Trump supporters should be wearing foil hats...."All you see is Wynn and Trump in Las Vegas"  Now that is a reason to vote for someone.  I am sure Judy didn't have to search very far for the Trump dummies.

All it does is prove The Stereotype that Trump supporters are stupid and Hillary supporters are intellectual. However, I know some intellectuals that will be supporting Donald Trump, but my vote is for Hillary Clinton.
11 | Bobpen Walendzik | 25 | 10154719414203675_10154719493268675 | 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin's puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals.3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade's cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said “ I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks.” Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person.4. You say you're patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution's limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin...etc5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton's history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can't ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional.8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem?9. I agree 100% if she's elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people’s money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home?11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin's little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right's anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country?12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said "Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,” and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillary's reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as "super-predators" in 1996? I don't agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don't care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.

Notice that most of his supporters are white people that want to blame someone for their misfortunes. Trump never offers solutions to the aggrieved. He doesn't have any and quite frankly he believes it sucks to be you. I feel these people need to record why they like Trump and play it back.

20 | Andrew Bugbee | 1 | 10154719414203675_10154719951478675 | Drumpf is as unsuitable for the presidency as Hillary is. That being said...These are issues which Hillary is on the record for either being involved in, supporting, flip flopping, and/or outright lying about. NAFTA, KXL, TARP, Columbia free trade agreement, Panama free trade agreement(Panama Papers), Haiti min wage suppression, UBS tax dodgers, Crime Bill, Iraq war vote, Patriot act (voted for twice), diversion of money from education to prison construction, increased foreign arms sales to human rights abusing states by 143%, bombing Libya, pushed no-fly zone in Syria, Welfare reform, three strikes legislation, DOMA, DADT, sold fracking, (one of the most environmentally damaging energy extraction processes), around the world, called the TPP the "gold standard" of trade deals, etc... Take note that I don't view Benghazi, Whitewater, or Vince Foster type Republican crap to be valid negative points against Hillary, and I haven't even brought up private servers, or DNC emails. Everything I listed here is a matter of record with no specious nor misogynistic allegations involved. Also take note that none of the Republican critics of Hillary ever mention any of these negatives because these are all things that Republicans favor. If any of you view stating things that are factual and part of her record as being negative, or as "bashing" Hillary, then maybe you might want to rethink your support for her. If you ignore her many less than admirable positions and actions, then your thinking is as corrupt as she is.GO GREEN!

Trump will go on trial in November accused of racketeering, and again in December accused of child rape. He is a sexual predator, hasn't released his tax returns, and has used his foundation's money to pay his legal fees. He has abused the family of a war hero and... oh, but let's talk about some emails Hillary didn't send from someone else's computer, that weren't a crime anyway, because that's how to choose a president. Come on, America. Focus.

I'd  comment about hunting in Maine but they've taken my firearms from me here in Massachusetts.... I'm 53 years old and 2 years ago they took all my guns (even my black powder rifle) because I had a DUI 32 years ago.2 years ago they took my guns for a DUI I had 32 years ago. They said I have to get a Doctors note saying I'm not an alcoholic. I drink about 1 or 2 glasses of wine a week. Perhaps 2 beers a month. So I meet with my HMO Doctor for the first time... and asked if she could do a blood test or something that proves I'm not an alcoholic.  This was a rather humiliating conversation... in that I had to tell her so I could get my LTC and FID back. Instead of doing any testing, she said she had to talk the HMO lawyers first. 2 weeks later she said no, the HMO LAWYERS said there's nothing they can do for me.When I tried renew my LTC/FID one of the questions on the form asked if I've ever had a DUI... I answered honestly and got all my guns taken!Mitt Romney passed that DUI take your guns away law in Massachusetts when he was Governor here. Look out, it's headed for the whole country under Hillary's rules. Just think what she'll do to the Supreme Court. Her and her band of anti-gun-nut Lefto's will enact laws that will do this to millions of more Americans.They even took my Son's Henry Mini Bolt 22!Trump 2016

We all keep seeing how much corruption comes out every day and the media keeps covering it up. Main Street Media to the Hillary supporter ignore all of Hillary’s Lies, Scandals, And Corruption, and Go Vote for Her then say Yes Master. Hillary is like the bully on the school yard that picks on the week and the naïve. She is willing to say anything and do anything to keep the money coming in to the Bill Clinton Inc. She has to use the power of the office to pardon herself and keep the corruption going on.   We have to look at all the women out of work, all the women that live in poor house, All Hillary is going is throw them under the bus after she gets their vote. Hillary has never able to pass the New York bar exam. Let’s talk about borders, if you cross the border illegally in Canada you get a $5000 fine, if you cross the border illegally in Iran you get 8 years in prison, if you cross the border illegally in North Korea you get shot, if you cross the border in Mexico illegally they have no hesitation in throwing you in jail, If you cross the border illegally in the U.S. you get a Drivers License, Medical Insurance, Housing, Career Training, the right to Vote. Obama care/Hillary care, Pennsylvania 53% increase, Arizona 116% increase, Minnesota 59% increase, Florida 20% increase, North Carolina 40% increase. Hillary has corrupted the FBI and the DOJ where we cannot trust them. She wants to fix the laws to her advantage not the American people will take it in the shorts again. If the people don’t want to take our country back then vote for Hillary is a vote for world war 3 with the Russia. There will a lot of good honest men and women black, white, Mexican; Cubans will die in a horrible and bloody death. This will come for years to come.

He has started a movement of hatred all over the country encouraging people that resonate with him to awaken old times, when humans abused even more than now the soul of our own brothers and sisters and make their life miserable. We can say that the founders of this country were high minded men, they build the nation on high principles, so high that they forged the nation we are now, I don't believe Trump's ideals, way of living or the way he approaches the world resonate with these great ideas and principles. We need to think about the changes that the world needs which is not too much, the world needs tender loving care from each of its citizens doesn't matter where they live. Look in to your heart and listen what it says, you'll find that as human beings the only thing we need and want is being happy and have joy. Forget about all politics try to look at the person's heart and based on that make your choice. Please VOTE wisely.

12 | Paula Israel | 7 | 10154719058748675_10154719524153675 | That is the most pathetic excuse to support a bigot, racist,sexist and as Sarlena below said -everything we stand for. I actually feel sorry for this guy- He must be really insecure. Does he really think he will be respected for what he is doing? Does he think his money will prove what a great person he is? What a great model he is for the future generations of our country. Bah Humbug- He just contributes to all of the evil and hatred that Trump believes in- I hope some of the attendees at the National Press Club left while he was talking.

14 | Jim Bullard | 7 | 10154719058748675_10154719329248675 | Outsider to government in the public service sense, but since our government is largely under the thumb of corporations these days I see him as the ultimate insider in the established order.
15 | Jane Chew-Bentley | 2 | 10154719058748675_10154721002613675 | “Donald Trump said he'd fight for workers and the middle class. Words are cheap, so let's look at his record: Donald Trump cheated his subcontractors, he cheated his workers, he shipped jobs overseas, he brought in foreign workers to do work that Americans could have done. He said he's worried about student debt, but he ran a fake "university" that was a predatory real estate scam designed to strip hardworking people of their bank accounts and max out their credit cards. I don’t see in Donald Trump someone who has ever woken up a single day in his life fighting for American workers. To the contrary, he has spent his life making himself rich at the expense of middle class Americans." - Jeff Merkley

19 | Dale Richner | 3 | 10154719058748675_10154719737883675 | I find his stance shameful. In what other context or industry or sector would we ever, ever say, "I'm not 100% happy with the status quo, so the best solution is to install a new leader who has the least amount of experience possible"? I wonder if that's his real reason.
20 | Wendy Mellon | 1 | 10154719058748675_10154719844798675 | What billionaire will be against Trump? He's not promising to raise taxes for the very wealthy. Hillary is.

6 | Ron Evans | 0 | 10154528076181083_10154529924701083 | The Russians now control 50% of all the uranium in the United States. The Clintons are the most corrupt politicians in American history and she may become president. American is screwed! Hillary Clinton sold the Russians uranium rights to mines in Wyoming! Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium DealThe headline on the website Pravda trumpeted President Vladimir V. Putin’s latest coup, its nationalistic fervor recalling an era when its precursor served as the official mouthpiece of the Kremlin: “Russian Nuclear Energy Conquers the World.”The article, in January 2013, detailed how the Russian atomic energy agency, Rosatom, had taken over a Canadian company with uranium-mining stakes stretching from Central Asia to the American West. The deal made Rosatom one of the world’s largest uranium producers and brought Mr. Putin closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.But the untold story behind that story is one that involves not just the Russian president, but also a former American president and a woman who would like to be the next one.At the heart of the tale are several men, leaders of the Canadian mining industry, who have been major donors to the charitable endeavors of former President Bill Clinton and his family. Members of that group built, financed and eventually sold off to the Russians a company that would become known as Uranium One.Among the agencies that eventually signed off was the State Department, then headed by Mr. Clinton’s wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.A Uranium One sign that points to a 35,000-acre ranch owned by John Christensen, near the town of Gillette, Wyo. Uranium One has the mining rights to Mr. Christensen’s property.

2 | Henry Green | 59 | 10154718761223675_10154718932743675 | "Hillary Clinton and Halloween Truth"Salem, Massachusetts - An old email server from 1692 belonging to Hillary Clinton has been found. After combing through the digital records from that year, it is clear Hillary is responsible for initiating the Salem Witch Trials. According to the emails from this server, she is a Witch and was willing to expose the other witches to remove all her competition. In email correspondence with the magistrates at that time, she was able to convince the Puritan leaders of her knowledge of the Bible and they followed her directives in convicting her adversaries in black magic and disposing of most of them before she had to stop or be exposed herself. The back story we are discovering, from these 1692 emails, is she was jealous of the other witches in Salem. She now uses her magical powers to control us for her evil ends of world domination. It is useless to resist. The power of her email servers have only increased through the centuries and her magical powers are unmatched. What people don't realize is she is responsible for manipulating Popes with her emails to exploit indulgences and prompt Martin Luther to begin the reformation, leading to centuries of division and conflict between Catholics and Protestants. Her magical powers are limitless. They have discovered her servers from 1776 and 1865. She corresponded with King George and flipped her allegiance back to the Colonies when they caught Benedict Arnold. It's all in the emails. In 1865, she was involved in the plot to kill President Lincoln. We would have never known without discovering the 1865 server! After a thorough investigation of new emails it is clear Hillary is responsible for the death of President Abraham Lincoln. The New Yorker reported this recently, but now the emails uncovered from her old server back in 1865 tell us the full story. According to the emails, she and Booth were romantically entangled, this was before Bill, and the emails are NC17 rated. They clearly indicate she wanted to get back at Abe. This had nothing to do with the war or any allegiance she had for the South. No, she was involved with Abe and he broke it off between them. She knew Booth was a Southern sympathizer and used him to get back at Abe. This is the real story of what happened. All true and now historically validated from her 1865 emails.Email evidence shows she was the brains behind the beginning of the KKK. Her email exchanges with Confederate General Nathen Bedford Forrest gives specifics to this history. While she pretended to support the Union, all of the emails from 1865 forward reveal she was a supporter of slavery and planned to undermine attempts for positive reconstruction. Forrest used instructions from her emails to set in motion the KKK. Only through these emails do we now know she was given the title Grand Wizard. This was a secret until the 1865 server was found.We are looking for her server from 1914. It is almost certain, from emails we have seen, that we will discover she was involved in the plot to kill Prince Ferdinand and helped begin WWI. Her server from 1929 is revealing to us how Hillary is responsible for the Great Depression. We knew this all along! On the same server, we see where she helped to formulate the Axis Powers of Japan, Italy, and Germany. She did this all through secret emails. We see no evidence of her involvement with Hitler or the holocaust, but that doesn't mean we won't find something later. She changed servers after WWII and went dark until she helped create the circumstances to keep Korea separated, North and South. Hillary's email server from 1959 was discovered and emails have been found to show she made the Cold War more complicated, is responsible for the fall of Cuba, and the fiasco of the Bay of Pigs operation. She is responsible for the deaths of President Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and Bobby Kennedy. As we continued to go over the emails from the 1960's, Hillary is responsible for the Vietnam War, the sexual revolution, drugs, and Rock 'n Roll. She gave us Richard Nixon and then is the one responsible for Watergate. The emails show it was Hillary all along, not Nixon! Her emails from the late 1970's show she was behind the Iranian hostage crisis. In the 1980's her emails reveal her involvement in the first Iraq War. In 1990, she got a new server and used her magical powers to get her husband, Bill Clinton, elected in 1992 as President of the United States. Since then, it is clear she has orchestrated every major event through her magical emails to bring us to 2016. In 2008, she was only outmatched by the Warlock Barack Obama! That is another story.Yes, Hillary Clinton has been planning to become POTUS since her days in Salem from 1692. In just a few short days this will become a reality. She has already set the magic in motion and there will be no resistance. I just wanted to make everyone aware of these historical facts on this Halloween of 2016. In an era of post-rationalism, I'm sure some may read this post and possibly believe what I just said is true. This makes me very sad. I'm still amazed on a daily basis how so many people are willing to believe whatever nonsense someone may say about Hillary and give a pass to a con man who is an admitted sexual predator, et al!

4 | Jim Williams | 25 | 10154718761223675_10154719054958675 | Unless the new emails reveal that Clinton cheated on three spouses, molested a dozen men, ripped off hundreds of workers and contractors and investors, defrauded hundreds of students, mocked a handicapped reporter, lost a billion on a casino in 1995 when the economy was booming, is going to court for fraud and raping a 13 year old boy, and used the money from her foundation to line her own pockets and bribe two attorneys general, I'm sticking with Hillary.
5 | Mickey LeRoy | 22 | 10154718761223675_10154718959363675 | Took them several days to find a Judge who would sign off......He is pulling what he pulled with another female candidate in NYC....Opened an investigation right before  an election..she lost and the investigation stopped...A pattern of behavior with him and women in power.....Remember Martha Stewart going to jail when others, males, got deals for what she did?
6 | Mitchell Sharp | 17 | 10154718761223675_10154718978063675 | Get ready for the next 4 years. Instead of voting to repeal Obamacare, now the Republicans will be holding hearings to investigate emails instead of doing their job.
7 | Bryan Evans | 14 | 10154718761223675_10154718884318675 | If the other thousands of e-mails didn't sink her ship, somehow I doubt they'll find a smoking gun on Wiener's PC (unless it's inappropriate pictures or sex texts from Madame Secretary).
8 | John Petrow | 9 | 10154718761223675_10154718922493675 | 650,000 emails that weren't bleached from her server! Doesn't look good for Hillary Rodham Clinton, her trustworthiness is falling fast! Why did her associate's plead the 5th amendment and refuse to answer questions? She has to much to hide!
9 | Surja Vishin | 10 | 10154718761223675_10154719057643675 | What a wastage of resources when FBI could be keeping us safe from terrorism - instead they have to play this game to satisfy congress. Shameful
10 | Stella Wilson | 4 | 10154718761223675_10154718954768675 | Why didn't they look for them when they found Weiner's dick pics. Makes no sense to me. The FBI got so fascinated with Weiner's dick they couldn't look to see if anything was from Hillary.
11 | Ralph Reinhold | 1 | 10154718761223675_10154719109283675 | Ne not-Hillary Clinton emails. The FBI said that the found metadata consistent with HRC's server. Since Wiener's wife had an account on HRC's sever and Abedin has state she had never used that computer. Why is the press not pressing forward the fact that the most likely scenario is that a wife wrote emails to her husband?
12 | Eric Turner | 5 | 10154718761223675_10154718898853675 | They need to fully investigate evidence of any and all possible criminal activity they encounter. Not limit it to a search for just classified material.
13 | Ike Udechukwu | 2 | 10154718761223675_10154719941838675 | TRUMP'S CORRUPTION IS EVEN WORSE - “Over the course of decades, Donald Trump’s companies have systematically destroyed or hidden thousands of emails, digital records and paper documents demanded in official proceedings, often in defiance of court orders. These tactics—exposed by a Newsweek review of thousands of pages of court filings, judicial orders and affidavits from an array of court cases—have enraged judges, prosecutors, opposing lawyers and the many ordinary citizens entangled in litigation with Trump. In each instance, Trump and entities he controlled also erected numerous hurdles that made lawsuits drag on for years, forcing courtroom opponents to spend huge sums of money in legal fees as they struggled—sometimes in vain—to obtain records.This behavior is of particular import given Trump’s frequent condemnations of Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, for having deleted more than 30,000 emails from a server she used during her time as secretary of state. While Clinton and her lawyers have said all of those emails were personal, Trump has suggested repeatedly on the campaign trail that they were government documents Clinton was trying to hide and that destroying them constituted a crime. The allegation—which the FBI concluded was not supported by any evidence—is a crowd-pleaser at Trump rallies, often greeted by supporters chanting, “Lock her up!”http://www.newsweek.com/2016/11/11/donald-trump-companies-destroyed-emails-documents-515120.html
14 | Rick Heinz | 10 | 10154718761223675_10154718949513675 | If I was in charge of the Clinton campaign, I would suggest the following commercial for her: (Staring into a camera and talking to you) For thirty years I have done the best I can to serve the people of this country in various positions and assignments. Thirty years...and my choice of email systems is the worst thing my opponent can do to find dirt on me? While I don't really think I needed to do so, I have apologized to the American people for my choice of email systems. As it turns out that system was more secure than the State Department, the Democratic National Committee, the IRS and Target among other systems that have been hacked. And except for two emails that apparently I missed (because they were improperly coded) nothing of even remotely national security material was ever sent to anyone. And these two emails were also considered immaterial to the FBI's overall review. If you are voting for someone else because I used a private email system (despite that facts that my two GOP predecessors also used private email systems), you probably weren't going to be voting for me anyway. Please don't use that as an excuse because that would simply be wrong. But if you are an independent voter and you really think my choice of email system was worse than the career decisions of my opponent (and that is impossible for me to conceive that would be the case), then I deserve to lose. My thirty years of service have meant something for the families of this country. My opponent's decisions did not. Internet systems in this country are an important issue. Mine wasn't. My choice of email system did not affect the job I did serving this country. And that's the bottom line. But if you elect me President, I promise that we'll work on internet security together as a priority. Thank you and God Bless the United States.
15 | Dan Erlenborn | 1 | 10154718761223675_10154721080338675 | Republicans won't stop until every device owned by all the thousands of people whoever sent or received an email that passed through Hillarys server is pried into.
16 | Liz Feeser-Regan | 2 | 10154718761223675_10154719277123675 | They are just coming after her full force, why don't they spend more time looking into Trump Univ or his rape case of a 13 year old girl.
17 | Fdra Eign | 1 | 10154718761223675_10154720093513675 | to wait after all this time and base your information off of what you "think" may be of substance instead of knowing whether it is or not but you throw it out to the American people anyways insufficiently and  unconfirmed sounds arranged and it's sloppy delivery with an intent to manipulate and intimidate  sounds like it comes with some foul play that's what it sounds like to me...that's like apple waiting to crack a code after it's already been cracked...right👍 you can probably stop watering dead plants
18 | Nancy Brockmon | 9 | 10154718761223675_10154718954533675 | When will people get over the email stuff that plagues Hillary's campaign! They find nothing much at all and make it into mountains of defamation.
19 | Barbara Crawford Davis | 6 | 10154718761223675_10154719095603675 | Comey had no information to release. He went against all precedence and advice to no useful purpose except the obvious result: an uproar just before the election when undecided voters are at last making up their minds. He clearly needs to be charged under the Hatch act. The media needed to do due diligence and give this non-information the non-attention it deserved rather than a universal feeding frenzy for ratings. The emphasis now needs to be on these facts, to prevent a blatant attempt to affect the election outcome from having any chance of succeeding. Can anyone in the media remember what journalistic integrity is?
20 | Donald D. Mittelstaedt | 3 | 10154718761223675_10154719011513675 | The amazing power of belief in a false equivalency.  While the ill-advised practice of using a private email server has been highlighted a 1,000 times, it is being equated to the 1,000 offenses of Trump each being mentioned once.  People are guilty of making a moral equivalence by acting as if the choices are similar. Bad thinking, terrible politics!
21 | Wally McQuade | 0 | 10154718761223675_10154719010223675 | This is good.  Not because of Clinton or any other biases, but rather the proper handling of of classified information.  If she is indicted, then that'll make fir an interesting election.  If it occurs after the election, I bet she'll be impeached.  Even by a Democratic majority in Congress.
22 | G.d. Hawksley | 2 | 10154718761223675_10154720107193675 | By the time this story turns out to be more smoke and no fire, the intended damage will have been done or not, and the people it matters to will only remember this headline.
23 | Sandy Stark | 4 | 10154718761223675_10154719951723675 | Oh Jesus Christ.  All the Republicans are trying to do is waste taxpayer money and delay the inevitable...SHE IS NOT GUILTY OF ANYTHING!!  If she was, don't you think the FBI would have figured it out by now??  How stupid are Republicans!!
24 | Karen Mueller | 2 | 10154718761223675_10154720303663675 | quit calling them "clinton emails". they are not. or at least , at the very least, we don't know that. quit it. really PBS. you are turning into fox news. no, wait. fox news is even defending clinton
25 | Les Samuelson | 0 | 10154718761223675_10154719230848675 | I thought they were all turned in.  Under oath, they both said that. But then again, what does "under oath" mean to a Clinton. True criminals who make the mafia look like rookies.

It's all about the money, not the person, the disease or lack overpriced insurance. The fight should be about bringing medical costs down in every area and not just about how to insure people. The entire industry is leveraged in a way to completely take advantage of the sick and the healthy. It's just stupid and inhumane. The entire industry should be regulated to ensure that everyone can afford to get sick.

1 | Kevin Kennedy | 2 | 10154718530803675_10154718534213675 | Senator Reid appeared with Clinton today to push back against the “inappropriate,” “unprecedented,” and “puzzling” move by FBI Director James Comey to suddenly go public with new emails. Roughly two months removed from retirement, Reid is waging an all-out war on Comey as he claims a “disturbing double standard” took place in the FBI’s decision to publish this misleading announcement while essentially ignoring Trump.Reid pointed specifically to information the FBI allegedly has that ties Trump to Russia – information Reid says they have intentionally sat on in order to not hurt the candidate’s chances of being elected.He expressed his ire in a blistering letter to Comey. Here’s a key passage:Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.And it’s not as though one can accuse Reid of being blindly partisan since he previously defended Comey when Republicans tried to filibuster his nomination and subsequently delay his confirmation. Reid wrote:“I believed you to be a principled public servant.”The actions of Comey were indeed politically motivated as he desperately wished to be loved again by law & order conservatives. But Reid just opened up a whole new can of worms.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images

Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that?

A majority of Floridians have already spoken. Two years ago, nearly 58 percent of voters said doctors should be able to prescribe medical marijuana for people with certain conditions. But because 60 percent is needed to pass a state constitutional amendment, the measure died.  This year, the push to legalize medical marijuana is back as Amendment 2. Once again, we urge voters to say "yes."http://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/endorsements/fl-endorse-medical-marijuana-20161003-story.htmlhttps://www.facebook.com/YesOn2Florida/https://www.facebook.com/UnitedForCare/https://www.facebook.com/JohnMorganESQ/Norml of Florida...https://www.facebook.com/groups/208044745901442/

The FBI's announcement that it is reviewing more emails related to Clinton might be this election’s October surprise.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jim Williams | 211 | 10154716408888675_10154716754508675 | Unless the new emails reveal that Clinton cheated on three spouses, molested a dozen men, ripped off hundreds of workers and contractors and investors, defrauded hundreds of students, mocked a handicapped reporter, lost a billion on a casino in 1995 when the economy was booming, is going to court for fraud and raping a 13 year old boy, and used the money from her foundation to line her own pockets and bribe two attorneys general, I'm sticking with Hillary.
2 | John Fahres | 65 | 10154716408888675_10154716757448675 | Bullsh**.  Sorry, PBS, but you know I'm right. This is just a follow up to what has already been investigated, and they'll come to the same conclusion as they did last time.  *eyeroll*
3 | Carol A. Esterley-Ruff | 45 | 10154716408888675_10154716767648675 | Did you know~ NEWSWEEK 09/12/16 Clinton’s email habits look positively transparent when compared with the subpoena-dodging, email-hiding, private-server-using George W. Bush administration. Between 2003 and 2009, the Bush White House “lost” 22 million emails. This correspondence included millions of emails written during the darkest period in America’s recent history, when the Bush administration was ginning up support for what turned out to be a disastrous war in Iraq with false claims that the country possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and, later, when it was firing U.S. attorneys for political reasons.....Like Clinton, the Bush White House used a private email server—its was owned by the Republican National Committee. And the Bush administration failed to store its emails, as required by law, and then refused to comply with a congressional subpoena seeking some of those emails. “It’s about as amazing a double standard as you can get,” says Eric Boehlert, who works with the pro-Clinton group Media Matters. “If you look at the Bush emails, he was a sitting president, and 95 percent of his chief advisers’ emails were on a private email system set up by the RNC.
4 | Rebecca Hudson | 12 | 10154716408888675_10154716762273675 | I talked to a group of intelligent people today, none of whom realized these emails weren't from her server, also heard the excuse that it's OK to vote Trump because he's not really going to do what he says, he's just saying that to get elected
5 | Mona Thornton | 17 | 10154716408888675_10154716848058675 | Shame on you PBS, for speculating about something which we have no information about, only innuendo. The media continues to act shamelessly. You should be spending more time covering the illegality of this action by Comey and review the Hatch Act for your viewers.
6 | Michele A Wilcox | 4 | 10154716408888675_10154717017843675 | This is coming from the legal counsel, Richard Painter, George W. Bush’s White House ethics lawyer from 2005 – 2007, wrote about his problems with the FBI’s latest investigation of Hillary Clinton and, most surprisingly, he’s taking legal action to stop it. According to Painter, it’s an abuse of power. The Hatch Act specifically prohibits government officials, with the exception of the President, the Vice President and a handful of others from engaging in political activities. Painter is particularly concerned about the fact that FBI director James Comey has made comments about Hillary Clinton in the past, such as his statement that Clinton’s handling of classified information was “extremely careless.”What seems “extremely careless” is the way Comey has handled this investigation.http://newcenturytimes.com/2016/10/30/bush-admin-just-got-involved-in-fbis-probe-into-clintons-emails-and-its-game-changing-image/
7 | Faye Matthews | 8 | 10154716408888675_10154716895048675 | The emails are old news. Move on. The October surprise was the audio of Trump's disgusting admission of being a sexual predator. Yes, we knew he had loose morals but this was criminal.
8 | Gerald Ott | 4 | 10154716408888675_10154716908283675 | The emails that Donald Trump has claimed will bring down Hillary Clinton are not quite the bombshell that he thinks, reports said Saturday. The revelation about new emails related to Hillary Clinton came out Friday, after FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress on the matter, a move that triggered panic and sent stocks plunging. Trump quickly swept up the story and told supporters the scandal would be “bigger than Watergate.” Yet an official told the Los Angeles Times late Friday that the emails in question weren’t sent to or from Clinton, nor did they contain any new information. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Comey’s letter to Congress was more a formality than anything else. http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2016/10/29/reports-email-bombshell-not-much-of-a-bombshell.html?via=mobile&source=copyurl
9 | Connie Atkinson | 4 | 10154716408888675_10154716839098675 | I used to have a top-secret security clearance. I went through hours of training about what was, and what was not allowed and the SEVERE penalities for breaking the rules and I was NOWHERE NEAR at her level. If this is significant enough for her to be investigated and prosecuted and Clinton is not, it will cause a Constitutional crisis of epic proportions. If she is investigated after her election we will have years of gridlock. Either way, the American people are screwed. Thank you, DNC, for ensuring BS was not your candidate!
10 | Carol Harris King | 5 | 10154716408888675_10154716941493675 | They don't even know what the emails are, just that they're on a laptop used by A. Weiner. This is Republican shenanigans to throw the election to Trump. It won't work.
11 | Carlen Arnett | 1 | 10154716408888675_10154718321728675 | OR, it might be what convinces the American public to VOTE, VOTE, VOTE in a real, functioning government over these spend and spend Republicans who gleefully and freely WASTE American tax dollars on one dog & pony Senate show after another!! GO HRC!!
12 | Bobpen Walendzik | 5 | 10154716408888675_10154716863688675 | 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin's puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals.3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade's cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said “ I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks.” Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person.4. You say you're patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution's limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin...etc5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton's history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can't ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional.8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem?9. I agree 100% if she's elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people’s money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home?11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin's little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right's anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country?12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said "Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,” and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillary's reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as "super-predators" in 1996? I don't agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don't care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.
13 | Jane Chew-Bentley | 0 | 10154716408888675_10154717280673675 | “Donald Trump should have been kicked out of the Republican Party the moment he began talking about violating the Constitution.The first time he hinted about assaulting the journalists covering his rallies, he should have been shown the door. When he openly advocated torture (“worse than waterboarding”), he should have been ushered away. When he began speaking of closing houses of worship, he should have been expelled.He has solemnly pledged to violate the First, Fourth and Eighth Amendments of the Constitution, at the least. If someone’s platform is unconstitutional, it boggles the mind that a major American party would put him or her up for president.How can he take the oath of office with a straight face?" –Juan Cole
14 | Sofia Jane Lugo | 0 | 10154716408888675_10154720191313675 | Looking at a different PBS story linked to this one, the relevance Comey spoke of has become quite clear. Apparently, the wife openly admitted that she never cleans out her email box so all the stuff she had when she worked at the state department is still there even though she swore, under penalty of perjury, to turn over any classified or otherwise sensitive info she had when she left the job. So what the FBI is investigating is whether or not she retained any emails from Clinton and if so whether any of those emails contained classified info. You can complain about the timing of this and that's valid, but the investigation itself is legitimate.
15 | John Scholz | 0 | 10154716408888675_10154719106768675 | Apparently there is a secret investigation to determine the link between the Russian Government and the Trump Campaign, where are your investigative reporters? It was just discussed in a Katie Couric interview on Yahoo News.

19 | Mercedes Amelia MC | 3 | 10154716408888675_10154717003728675 | Anyone who equates Hillary Clinton’s “issues” with Donald Trump’s Corruption has no idea of the facts. Consider, for example, Trump’s illegal contribution to Florida’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, after she received multiple complaints from Florida students that they were cheated by Trump University. Once she received a $25,000 donation from Trump, her office dropped the inquiry.Or Trump’s solicitation of campaign funds from foreign officials, in clear violation of federal campaign laws.Or Trump’s refusals to pay contractors who have done work for him, many of them small businesses.Or Trump University’s repeated scams.Or the Trump Network, a pyramid scheme in violation of federal securities regulations.Or Trump Model Management, which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U.S. illegally.Or Trump’s employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts, claiming he couldn’t find Americans to do the work.Or Trump’s history of being charged with housing discrimination.Or Trump’s illegal dealings with Cuba while it was under embargo.Or Trump Foundation operating illegally.The list goes on. Donald Trump has a proven record of corruption. Hillary Clinton does not. Anyone who equates the two hasn't been paying attention.It would be nice to have an FBI investigation into these facts on Trump.(Jere). I agree! with Jere and I don't understand why Trump's errors and corruption are constantly ignored and this man laughs all including the FBI that instead of doing their job, create intrigue to favor Republicans. I VOTED FOR " HILLARY CLINTON " BLUE ALL THE WAY.

A vote for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka and the Green Party is a vote for a viable multi-party democracy going forward."Just 5 percent of the national vote for the Green Party Stein/Baraka ticket can be a true game-changer for American politics. It will qualify the Green Party for recognition as an official national party, and for federal funding in the 2020 presidential race proportional to the amount of votes received — at least $8 million to $10 million. It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state). It means the party can leap over the undemocratic barriers to ballot access for independent parties in many states, and help us lay the groundwork for a truly competitive challenge to the two-party system and the corporate rule it perpetuates."Third Party Presidential Forum:One week before what’s shaping up to be an historic presidential election, Tavis Smiley on PBS will host a presidential forum featuring the third party candidates, Jill Stein of the Green Party and Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party.This forum will be taped live Monday, October 31, 2016, in the show’s Los Angeles studio and air on Tavis Smiley over two nights next week on Mondayevening and Tuesday, November 1 on PBS.
