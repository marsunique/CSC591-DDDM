1 | Jill Boccuzzi | 8 | 10154992200143812_10154992229188812 | I am so disgusted with ABC for littering the airwaves with repetitive Clinton ad campaigns highlighting Trump's profanity during the time periods in which children might be present. Thoughtful. Thanks.
2 | Eric Gunesch | 3 | 10154992200143812_10154992240148812 | #Trump When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. --

That's what will happen according to WikiLeaks numerous documents. Her foundation took a huge cut of the 80billion the Saudi's invested in US arms. They are all destined to end up in Isis fighters hands.

5 | Heine Inge Graawe | 0 | 10154992200143812_10154992236993812 | We believe Trump is a grave threat to democracy, freedom, human rights, equality, and the welfare of our country and all our people.We have witnessed Trump inciting hatred against Muslims, immigrants, women, the disabled. We have seen him evidencing dangerous tendencies that threaten the bedrock of democracy: unleashing a lynch mob mentality against protestors, calling for the expulsion of Muslims from the country, bullying, and fear-mongering.History has shown us what happens when people refuse to stand against hate-filled leaders.We pledge ourselves to speak out in every way possible against the politics of hate and exclusion he represents.

25 | Cheryl Gage | 0 | 10154992200143812_10154992223898812 | Trump has a shocking number of pending charges & legal cases against him. They are both civil & criminal in nature.1. When Trump asked his supporters to vote for him on November 28th, this Freudian slip revealed the depth of his concern with that date. November 28th is the day on which Low v. Trump University LLC, a jury trial, goes forward under U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, born in Indiana. Yes, he is the same Federal judge that Trump insulted. 2. There is a 2nd pending California case, Cohen v. Trump. Judge Curiel allowed this case to go forward under the Racketeer Influenced & Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). This is huge for a lot of reasons. First, this case will disclose Trump‚Äôs actual net worth. Second, he would have to pay back everyone he defrauded. Third, RICO carries criminal penalties!3. In NY, State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is suing Trump University for fraud. 4. The sleeper here is his BLATANT violation of the federal election laws.  ‚ÄúContributions and donations may not be solicited, accepted, or received from, or made directly or indirectly by, foreign nationals who do not have permanent residence in the United States. This prohibition encompasses all US elections; including federal, state and local elections. 5. Jane Doe v. Trump involves the rape of a 13-year-old & his 'terrific friend',  convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. The statute of limitations has expired for the criminal aspect but this would involve civil penalties. It is now set for December 16th in New York City. {UPDATE: DUE TO DEATH THREATS BY TRUMP SUPPORTERS, THE PLAINTIFF WAS FORCED TO DROP HER LAWSUIT}6. Senator Barbara Boxer has asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate his modeling agency for illegal importing women. 7. Not yet filed but within the Statute of Limitations is that minor matter of bribing the Attorneys General of FL & TX not to prosecute Trump University & the fact that Trump paid the bribes from his 'Foundation'.

In order to win the presidency, a candidate has to secure a majority of electoral votes, which is 270. In every state except for Nebraska and Maine, the presidential candidate who wins the majority of the popular vote wins the state's electoral votes.

1 | Vincenti Vincenzo | 22 | 10154992162948812_10154992169243812 | Trump might clearly lose this election but he will have only his stupid rhetoric to blame. Many people are voting for Clinton because they think Trump is a clown.
2 | Hayley DeeAnn Vaughn Johnson | 12 | 10154992162948812_10154992172448812 | Hillary isn't guilty, prove it without Anonymous, youtube, Wikileaks ( run by a rapist that ran from the consequences; Innocent men don't run ) or Fox News. Snopes the information. Actually back your words up with facts, not just things you heard from people and agree with.
3 | Karen Franklin Pledger | 2 | 10154992162948812_10154992197883812 | What if Trump votes for Hillary?ü§î and reality has set in and he knows beyond a shadow of a doubt, he can't run this country..hmmmmmmm think out loud
4 | Holly Bailey | 4 | 10154992162948812_10154992199588812 | Not exactly intentional voter fraud but local polling location attendant stupidity. I went to vote and the gentleman in front of me (behind the curtain) selected a write-in but apparently hit the wrong button so he called for the attendant who did not know how to correct the situation so she called over to the other attendants and the man (in his best Nancy Pelosi voice) said push the button and "see what happens." Really? That's the level of competence at the polling location here. Well what happened was it registered part of his voting selections but they had no idea to to correct it and couldn't figure out whether to let him vote again or allow his partial selections. Not one attendant there knew how to handle the situation which was unfortunately not a surprise. Run Forrest Run!
5 | David Hersh | 4 | 10154992162948812_10154992177263812 | MANY of my friends ( and my own family ) depend on the Earned Income Tax Credit each year to boost their tax returns. For many of us, it is the only time during the year when we get even a tiny boost to get things we all depend on. ( and also help to catch up with Xmas bills )What many of them don't realize is that Trump's tax plan does away with the Earned Income Tax Credit which so many struggling, working Americans depend on for a big tax refund check each February.But Trump does give an average extra $1.3 million back to the top 1%. Yes, THAT is who he is looking out for.Your vote for Trump means no big tax return next year or the year after that or the year after that.Don't vote against your own self interests. #VoteBlue

8 | Joe Middleton | 3 | 10154992162948812_10154992209048812 | What this fails to mention is you only need 12 states to win the election. So you don't need every state. And again you can win the popular vote and still lose the election, so that is again a false statement ABC News.
9 | Jack Ardrey | 20 | 10154992162948812_10154992168993812 | I can't wait until this is over and TRUMP wins. Clinton the racist did support mass incareration of black youth. #ImWithHim #TRUMP

11 | Sandra Marv | 1 | 10154992162948812_10154992208183812 | Trump is the WORST thing to ever happen to America. He has made people HATE again.

15 | Michael Angelo de Castro | 6 | 10154992162948812_10154992167208812 | One thing Trump has proven is that unconditional love, being nonjudgmental, and moral relativism really does not exist for the left. Of course many of us already knew this. Watching it play out bigly is comical. Enjoy!

He even said  in an interview that his mind hasn‚Äôt changed since the 6th grade!!!SNIFFIN‚Äô LOOSE CANNONWe have seen him sniffing like a loose cannon when Hillary was critical of him in the debates. His wife Melania has said several times that he hits back 10 times harder when someone opposes him.

1 | Emma Ginder | 34 | 10154992061168812_10154992112558812 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏è

She deleted these documents AFTER she received a federal subpoena...her intent was criminal!!

4 | Carlos L.

Is that democracy? What if they belong to the same group or organization and a vote for any of them means the same? Democracy would be to write on the ballot the name we wanted. That would be to exercise our right correctly.

A child can see the dishonesty on his face. Chosen to be a running-mate only because he's from a Swing State, has a son in the army, speaks Spanish, etcetera. Sad.
6 | David H Craig | 5 | 10154992061168812_10154992108313812 | Hillary has no credibility, Regardless of what Hillary Clinton says she is still under investigation by the FBI, one by the Public Corruption Group the other by the National Security Group. The Email is the only Scandal is closed for now.
7 | Keren Candiotti-Dombrowski | 7 | 10154992061168812_10154992084783812 | It's a sad commentary on American society when uneducated voters are influenced by celebrities who have been paid by foreign money to induce your votes so they can gain access to the White House, instead of educating themselves on the real issues. Beyonce vs Wikileaks. How big of a moron are YOU? #neverhillary

10 | Roger Lee Lewis | 3 | 10154992061168812_10154992117258812 | A VOTE FOR HILLARY IS A VOTE FOR SHARIA LAW...when she allows all the Muslims here most may believe in it and one day this country might too and thats bad for everyone especially women.

17 | Cathy Clare Bowers | 7 | 10154992061168812_10154992070753812 | Kaine is a rambling idiot. Hillary should be in prison and not allowed to be running for Commander in Chief.
18 | Russell Parker | 1 | 10154992061168812_10154992196163812 | After watching this race for two years now, I know exactly the things Trump wants to do for America. Honestly, I can't name one thing Hillary wants to do except be elected. #MAGAAnd Tim Kaine should come out of the closet.
19 | Gordon Gabaree | 0 | 10154992061168812_10154992206213812 | Hey go look at Mr. Trumps Contract to the American People!.Wow!.......He's got real answers to real problems and remember that I lock my doors at night and I've own homes with walls and so do alot of us for many different reasons.That doesn't make us racists! So listen to me, Millions of Trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Radical Islamic Terrorists are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that sometimes he changed a position.He's showing us he can be a flexible leader as we show him are concerns.We don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Kasich, McConnel, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Radical Islamic Terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.Great businessmen built this country of ours in the likes of Rockefeller,Vanderbilt and Carnegie! They had bankruptcy's.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND  JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.He even asks groups of us what we want him to do regarding issues that all of us live by.Wow, For the People,By the People!We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing,Obamacare needs to be replaced and State borders need to be opened up for real healthcare competition and even the phoney Pay for Play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a Non-Politician. He's not perfect, he's 70 years old and made his fortune and I think he's Truly  Genuine in his love of our counrty and wants to make things better for All.... Despite his flaws try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country and remember that Mike Pence is a Good Man and Politician standing beside Mr. Trump."

Mothers and daughters went to the polls together, celebrating what could be a historic moment if Hillary Clinton becomes the first female president of the U.S.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kevin Arnold | 756 | 10154991995713812_10154991998713812 | Of all the amazing women in the world that could have been the first female president - we are stuck with this corrupt career scum politician.
2 | Carlos Fernandez | 249 | 10154991995713812_10154992013003812 | My wife and daughter voted for Trump. Maybe they didn't get the DNC memo or maybe they felt the criteria to choose a president should go beyond what the person's sex is.
3 | Chris Matthes JD | 355 | 10154991995713812_10154991999153812 | The United States of America is on the brink of collapse. The United States cannot afford more debt, the United States cannot afford more entitlements, the United States cannot afford to open our borders to 550,000 Syrian refugees, the United States cannot afford to allow the murder of perfectly viable babies in their 3rd term, the United States cannot afford Hillary Clinton!
4 | Ashley Hill | 200 | 10154991995713812_10154992004968812 | ??? If you vote for her because she's a woman and so are you, you really just don't get it. I'm amazed by this mentality.
5 | Christian Gore | 235 | 10154991995713812_10154992001868812 | If I had been under FBI investigation I wouldn't have been able to get a job at Arby's. She's the embodiment of ELITISM and ESTABLISHMENT.
6 | Tim Turner | 123 | 10154991995713812_10154992013643812 | Trump is the clear choice but if Hillary wins we will not regard her as a president but a piece of trash criminal that is never welcome here. Oh yes lets fight sexism but display it by voting for her based on sex. Hypocrites
7 | Diane Cicinnati Grippo | 94 | 10154991995713812_10154992019228812 | ABC....give it up! No one is buying the whole Mothers and Daughters are going to the polls to proudly vote for a corrupt poor excuse for a woman. That will happen when a woman who women can be proud to vote for runs.
8 | Tammy Nodurft Mathews | 78 | 10154991995713812_10154992023703812 | As I WOMAN, I am appalled that THIS is our first female nominee! And I can say without hesitation that any women I know who vote for her should just go ahead and cut ties with me. Because I think it is the MOST ignorant thing an American can do!
9 | Lauren Miano | 75 | 10154991995713812_10154992019303812 | Makes history?? To be the first criminal elected President....I'm all for having a female President but not this fool. WAKE UP AMERICA....you can not deny the corruption that surrounds her and involves her. Don't vote for her just because she will be the first female President for Christ sakes....she has lied and lied and lied and put our nation's security at risk...lied under oath...has blood on her hands from years of corruption. Let's make history by showing the world we can rise up as a country together to throw a government so corrupt and incestuous and take it back for WE THE PEOPLE! We are a laughing stock to rest of the world....and electing her will bring ZERO positive changes...for the love of baby J WAKE UP!!!
10 | Jake Woodall | 42 | 10154991995713812_10154992027978812 | My mother and I went to vote together as well!!! Just to make sure that evil woman doesn't step foot back in the White House!
11 | Tony Longoria Jr. | 25 | 10154991995713812_10154992008558812 | I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic of Donald Trump for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty Injustice For All. #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN
12 | Jimmy Colachicco | 15 | 10154991995713812_10154992041578812 | Hopefully someday an honorable woman that we can all be proud of will be elected President  instead of this career criminal and habitual Liar.
13 | Kathie Termyna Wolfe | 27 | 10154991995713812_10154992013588812 | The mom/daughter I am, pretty amazing, I went to the polls and voted all by myself and voted for the AMERICAN and not the politician,,,,, NOW THAT in itself is HISTORICAL,,,,
14 | Stephen Vaughan | 20 | 10154991995713812_10154992017723812 | I understand now why people are voting for hillary. They want to be a part of history. If she wins we can kiss our beloved country goodbye.
15 | Shirlene Bailey | 12 | 10154991995713812_10154992061023812 | My daughters and I went to the polls, separately, celebrating what could be a historic moment of electing Donald Trump For President, in spite of voter fraud, non citizens being encouraged to vote and non stop cheating by the Democratic regime.
16 | Lindy Ducker | 10 | 10154991995713812_10154992059093812 | Yes hug your mother who used foundation money to support you and pay for your wedding while people in Haiti still live in tents. How can someone like this, pure selfish evil run for president. How are people so blind.
17 | Chassy Ellis | 13 | 10154991995713812_10154992034858812 | ABC you are so paid off and so liberal but you see that we the people can see through Hillarys lies and corruption. She's going straight to hell and what a glorious day that will be for America
18 | Renee Johnson Futch | 17 | 10154991995713812_10154992044368812 | My 13 year old daughter is going with me and my husband to the polls today and watch us vote for TRUMP!!!!
19 | Eileen Todahl | 7 | 10154991995713812_10154992149078812 | Never will I vote for some just because they are a women. Hillary is not a women, she's a demon... She would do nothing good for us, but will line her pockets at our expense if she is elected. She will have us under NWO, we will suffer as a nation...
20 | Dawn Baird-Chastain | 6 | 10154991995713812_10154992088813812 | This is not an honorable thing ladies!get off the fixation on the first female prez doesn't the persons character mean an thing to you? Dear God are you blind to who she is and what she's done? This woman is a corrupt beast!
21 | Vanessa Griego | 20 | 10154991995713812_10154992010963812 | Wtf already with the corrupt clinton support ABC...., YOU SUCK ABC
22 | Leo Decaj | 52 | 10154991995713812_10154991996698812 | Keep this in mind before you Vote please .Donald Trump did not steal your money. Donald Trump did not raise your taxes. Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food. Trump is not stirring a race war. Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims. Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda. Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East. Trump did not betray Israel. Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. Trump did not cripple our economy. Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars. Trump did not ruin our credit, twice. Trump did not double African American unemployment. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans. Trump did not set free all of terrorists in Guantanamo bay. Trump did not steal your rights, violate US Constitutional law, or commit treason, hundreds of times. Yet Trump is being ripped apart in the news, non stop. Barrack Hussein Obama, Hillary Clinton and the criminals occupying our government, are not. The media is the Democratic Party. Save our culture. Stop listening to them..!!
23 | Carol Rickett Charles | 7 | 10154991995713812_10154992083873812 | Whether you are for Trump or Hillary hearing people say they are voting for Hillary to have the first women president is the worse excuse I've heard!! You don't vote just because of the Gender !!
24 | Samuel Kalode | 5 | 10154991995713812_10154992071908812 | Breaking News: Hillary Clinton has just been declared winner of the 2016 media person of the year. .....Breaking: Trump wins 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Hillary Clinton supporters are suiting up to the polls this morning in homage to the Democratic candidate's signature look.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Krissy Dicorcia | 347 | 10154991938313812_10154991950308812 | So are trump supporters.  We are wearing red but abc wont cover that . Because trump, wikileaks and anonymous are right. You're biased.
2 | Andrew Carter | 261 | 10154991938313812_10154991943718812 | they are so excited to vote for someone who sold us out to corporations and foreign interests, I would rather love my country and be deplorable than vote for another establishment politician like Clinton, Bush or Obama.
3 | Hillary Bayne | 165 | 10154991938313812_10154991975183812 | Every time I see a female Clinton supporter I feel like that parent who's child wants an art degree: I love you, I support you and I'll defend you, but God Damn you're stupid.-American Veteran.
4 | Maria Perez | 112 | 10154991938313812_10154991945423812 | I'm all about live and let live. But this is getting crazy! For example, I have a friend who gets about $800 a month in social security. Her spouse can't work at this time, and his monthly insurance premium is jumping from @ $230 per month to about $750 per month. If she didn't take on a part time job, that would leave them with less than $50 a month to live on. So while the wealthy celebrities are stumping for Clinton, and the people on subsidized health care are voting for Clinton, the people who have worked all of their lives, and those of us in the middle class are getting screwed. I've seen people's names changed because they bought a new social security card illegally, I've been to the richest cities in the country with people sleeping on the sidewalks, I've been called racist because I don't agree with this administration, I've seen towers fall, and I've seen my hometown county turn into the 2nd most affected by meth and heroin in NY state, (of which Clinton was a Senator). I've watched videos of Clinton saying she was against gay marriage, that she was for a border wall, called young black men "super predators" and her outright lies about a little place called Benghazi. As I've said before, I don't know if Trump is the answer, but this woman, with all of the opportunity she has had to affect change, is definitely not the answer. She walked into Washington 40 plus years ago with the sole purpose to gain the Presidency. It's been about her the entire time. Kicked off the Watergate case for taking home documents, lying under oath, and the most recent admission of accepting an unreported gift of 1 million dollars from a foreign nation (that which you need to report). They left Haiti, still in ruins. This woman can't even wear an American flag pin, as to not offend her foreign counterparts. This is not the America my ancestors came here for. Scared to speak your mind, less control over your children's upbringing, and a new database with your private healthcare information going straight to the government. All true. All evidence based in fact. When Tuesday is over, one way or another it's gonna be scary. I just hope. I don't know what I hope. But I'm gonna have a back up plan.Trump 2016
5 | Steve Walton | 88 | 10154991938313812_10154991952018812 | Hillary Supporters, You think you are right about voting for Hillary Clinton, but the children in your family will suffer tremendously in a country with no borders and no guns to protects ourselves. I am assuming that when you go to bed at night that you don't lock your doors and that there is a sign in your yard saying "Come on in", coz that is exactly what Hillary represents for this country. No security while we go about our daily lives and inviting all terrorists, drug smugglers, and hardened criminals to come on in. Shame on you for not thinking about the future of your children a little harder before you made this crucial decision. If she wins, you will see the America you have created for them.
6 | Shelley Penderson | 65 | 10154991938313812_10154991975928812 | My husband wears proudly "I'm a Hillary deplorable ". On back "NEVER HILLARY." People stop him on the street to tell him they love his shirt. So you women wear your Nasty Woman shirts. It fits Hillary perfect.
7 | James M. Fabiano | 5 | 10154991938313812_10154991995728812 | Said prayers, blessings, chants and good energy to the Universe. May love and hope win today. May equalities prevail and grow. May women around the world be proud and stand tall. For equal pay, equal rights and for our planet and allies may we elect our countries first woman President Hillary Clinton <3 Blessed be, Amen and think I have my bases covered
8 | Brandi Whitford-Turnage | 23 | 10154991938313812_10154991964988812 | Wake up America, Christians!! Not that I'm Trumps #1 fan but it's a sad day in America that we even have to worry about who will win this election. I stand firm on my morals, character and religious beliefs and although I don't approve of all of Trumps comments, etc. I still choose HIM! My brain can't even process everything Hillary stands for and never will! No one is perfect by any means and definitely not him, but IF we want America back, we MUST VOTE TRUMP! Praying for our country. üôèüèºüá∫üá∏We will be voting for Trump today. Our number ONE reason is because he is the only person running who seems to value the life of an unborn child and to me, that is enough in itself.However, besides pro life, he is pro police, pro 2nd amendment, pro military, and pro business. All of which I support. I will not debate anyone on this so if you do not agree, it is a free country (so far). If you do not plan to vote or are undecided then please take a minute to read this.....Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald J. Trump for President
9 | Kelly Gooding Mika | 9 | 10154991938313812_10154991972183812 | Is it just me or when ever I see someone reply it's always that they are for Trump. So why is Hillary gonna win? God help us all I don't even thing I'm gonna turn on the TV!
10 | Diane Cicinnati Grippo | 11 | 10154991938313812_10154991977283812 | Wow....All 4 of her supporters are wearing pantsuits...Good for them! Good Luck Hillary...you're going to need it...if I were you I'd have my bags packed and ready to flee the country....because you are going down after Trump wins, along with ABC who refuses to report actual truth and facts.
11 | Matthew Thomas Goodness | 9 | 10154991938313812_10154991965738812 | Not in New Hampshire. It's been made illegal here to wear clothing supporting your candidate to the polls. You'll be turned away apparently. But we can open or conceal carry our weapons.
12 | Mickey Cheech | 7 | 10154991938313812_10154992054368812 | LOL what a joke.And who could vote for Pantsuits McCriminal with a clear conscience? Its amazing how people don't care about all her criminal behavior.I guess morals are really a thing of the past.
13 | Lana Mary | 3 | 10154991938313812_10154991971088812 | Haters haters haters ! It's unbelievable! Reading the comments and it's the exact reason for the group. If you don't like it just move on.
14 | Kelly Reagan-Robery | 4 | 10154991938313812_10154992083478812 | So sad that THIS is the woman to run as the first female president when there are so many other women with actual integrity and ethics who know what it means to tell the truth... The fact that so many female voters are choosing her based solely on her gender while ignoring all the dishonest acts she has committed in her past almost makes me embarrassed to be a woman.
15 | Donna Whitters Plechaty | 4 | 10154991938313812_10154992065438812 | Oh isn't this just cute! Democratic party basically picked your candidate with super delegates.  The DNC was okay having the Socialist run against her thinking that it would be an easy victory  in the primaries, and they still had to rig it against him since it got a little dicey after all!  Yeah that seems fair doesn't it.  #DrainTheSwamp
16 | John McAuliffe | 29 | 10154991938313812_10154991947693812 | Hillary has molded your gender and your race into insecurities and has told you to base your vote on those insecurities only. Shameful

21 | Pamela Danner | 0 | 10154991938313812_10154992213088812 | Think about this before you hit the polls today please. This country has immigration policies in place which are there for anyone who wishes to legally become a citizen of our great country. They key word here is legally. Granting amnesty and sanctuary to people who enter our country illegally is promoting a crime. They are called illegal immigrants because they have broken a law. They have committed a crime. Our laws are in place to protect the CITIZENS of the United States. Providing these criminals with health, food and housing benefits will seriously deplete our economy and divert monies that could and should be used to take care of our own people in need. On top of that, it will be opening the flood gates for anyone and everyone to pour into our country further depleting our resources. If your argument is that they are living in a depressed country with little or no opportunity for employment then maybe you should think about ways to help out those countries. Don't sacrifice ours. Our economy is in serious trouble right now folks. Think long and hard before you cast your vote. Our children's and grandchildren's futures depend on it.
22 | Brian Eubanks | 4 | 10154991938313812_10154991963758812 | When this election is over will you be proud of how you acted? Will you be able to say you showed dignity and were honest or did you hurl insults and spread lies? I don't mean will you be satisfied with the results and think that the ends justified the means but will you truly believe that you showed respect, dignity and honesty.
23 | Timon Ingwersen | 0 | 10154991938313812_10154992267263812 | ABC, you better get out some chopstick with all the a $$ kissing you been doing with Hillary. Why not try and be unbiased and cover both sides equally? Every Trump story is so big bad wolf and every Hillary story is the next Disney movie.

This all started because someone stood up to this little man and fired shots back at him and embarrassed him.

If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten.  If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

21 | Henry Bubba Hollingsworth | 8 | 10154991876243812_10154991910158812 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏è

2 | Beverly Miller | 1 | 10154991736183812_10154991963763812 | A friend started this conversation & has thousands in agreement including myself:One of my big pet peeves is that, on election day, the news calls the election way to early, before west coast polls are even closed. When I lived on the west coast, I used to work with a guy that would change his vote based on who was winning, so that he could say that he had voted for the winner. I found that to be pretty shallow.It is unfair to both the candidates and voters to have an election "called" while people are still voting. Other than unofficial exit polls, no state results should be announced until after midnight.

6 | Shirley C. Woodard | 0 | 10154991736183812_10154992058018812 | - This station on "Good Morning America" this morning had little brain-washed kids stating that we need gun control and something about having more interaction with other countries!!  How dare they brain-wash little children with these ideas!!  Globalists!!  And everything they say or show about Donald Trump, the one person that could save our country and put it back on course, is negative.  I usually watch Fox News (which is now also going off course recently), but like to check in once in a while with other stations. GMA is not a program that I normally watch.  I need to see and hear pro-America stations.
7 | Shirley C. Woodard | 3 | 10154991736183812_10154991832753812 | - A "Friend" on Facebook took the high road and says we should not get angry at people who do not vote the same way we do! Here was my answer: "- Forgive me if I do get mad at fools that would vote to open our borders to all foreigners, vote for a person who is corrupt to the very core, for a person that would double again our national debt, who will appoint judges that will take away our second amendment and keep barbaric laws that allow unborn babies at full term to be torn apart in partial birth abortions and will take our weapons away so we cannot protect ourselves nor our families, a person who will give our citizens' and our vets' money to foreigners who have not put in one dime, a person who encourages lawlessness and puts criminals who have murdered our citizens in "sanctuary cities", and a person who will be unable to protect us from China, Russia, Iran, and ISIS with a weakened military!! Here are the categories I put people in that vote for that low-life woman: Criminals, career welfare people, Muslims, Hispanics, African-Americans (some blacks are REAL Americans), Globalists, and idiots (includes college people - they can be educated fools)! I AM ANGRY AT THESE CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE living in my United States that ARE NOT REAL AMERICANS, and are voting to destroy my country!! There are a lot of them today. 50 years ago, the majority here loved this country and would never vote for a foreign muslim to lead it, nor vote to put this corrupt, globalist woman in charge!

9 | James M Lowe | 3 | 10154991736183812_10154991812563812 | Issue; Don Trump efforts: Thank you Don Trump for YOUR efforts in the primaries and the election campaign, win or lose. I started out as a Hard Charging worker for Ted Cruz although, inside, I expected Scott Walker would be the primary winner and the ultimate November election winner. I voted for Ted Cruz in the Michigan primary election and the Trump Team slaughtered us. 2 weeks before the Indiana primary, figures clearly showed that Trump would win the primary and the nomination. I had to decide THEN whether to Move On to the Trump campaign and waited until the Indiana primary was done and went Full Bore to work for the Trump campaign. It was surprising to see clinton and Sanders come out for a virtual Progressive, Socialist, Communist agenda and I decided to "switch into 3rd gear" for the Trump team. It has cost me a lot of money, for my income level, I don't know exactly how much and OVER 1,000 hours of Personal Time out of My Life to work his campaign. Many times I fell asleep on my key board and had to take breaks from working the campaign and when I woke up and Came Back, I found out Trump had been working all the way through my rest time. If Mitt Romney had worked like this, 4 years ago, Don Trump would NOT have had to run for prez. I hope the Christian Evangelists will pray and vote for an election victory TODAY for Don Trump. God speed.

13 | Sydney Nichols | 2 | 10154991736183812_10154991754558812 | America is at a crossroads, If you are considering writing in a name or voting 3rd party, America is in JEOPARDY! Todays electionSome people have brought up the fact that they won't vote if the eventual nominee is not the person they want. I just want to put something in perspective. Justice Scalia's seat is vacant. Ginsberg is 82 years old Kennedy is 79 Breyer is 77 Thomas is 67.Nowadays, the data shows that the average age of a Supreme Court retirement or death occurs after 75.These are 5 vacancies that will likely come up over the next 4-8 years.The next President will have the power to potentially create a 7-2 Supreme Court skewed in their ideology. Think about that  7-2.If the next President appoints 5 young justices, it will****guarantee control of the Supreme Court for an entire generation. And 7-2 decisions will hold up much more over time than 5-4 decisions which are viewed as lacking in mandate. Hillary has made it clear she will use the Supreme Court to go after the 2nd Amendment. She has literally said that the Supreme Court was wrong in its Heller decision stating that the Court should overturn and remove the individual right to keep and bear arms. Period. Anyone and Everyone who is saying that they won't vote for one candidate or the other if they are the GOP nominee, please realize this. Hear this! If Hillary Clinton wins and gets to make these appointments, you likely will never see another conservative victory at the Supreme Court level for the rest of your life.Ever.Whoever is the GOP  nominee, go VOTE for the GOP Nominee! Remember Romney?Three million conservatives who had voted for McCain did not cast a vote for Romney (for whatever reason and the result was four additional years of B.H.O.) AND ONE FINAL THOUGHT, Hillary''s already on the record as saying that her buddy, B.H.O. "would make a great Supreme Court Justice."  DID YOU JUST READ THAT LAST SENTENCE?  NOW ARE YOU SCARED?I am not crazy about either candidate, but I look at it this way, our freedoms, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to bear arms, which candidate will protect those freedoms or which one will put those freedoms in jeopardy?  Who is pro life? Who has been successful financially?  Who hasn't lied to the American people about Benghazi?  Who hasn't lied to the American people about 30,000 emails?  The list of questions goes on and on, and at the end of the day, it is like Rick and Bubba put it, vote for flawed or evil?  I simply cannot vote for evil. If I choose to stay home or write in someone, it is a vote for Hillary. Crazy messed up system, but that is what we get as an American voter. So for this gal I will take flawed Trump!From that standpoint, on the vote your conscience, I understand, totally. An American with a clear conscience simply cannot vote for Hillary, that is an oxymoron!Hilkary has the SAME AGENDA as Obama to destroy America. Hillary took $$$ from both domestic & foreign donors, Hillary OWES them...think about it!  Copy and paste and SHARE with everyone you know that America is in JEOPARDY!

Yet she is still just neck and neck with Trump who has pretty much gone it alone. WTF does that tell you America. IT IS TIME FOR THE CORRUPTION TO END AND TIME TO PUT AMERICA FIRST.

3 | John McAuliffe | 157 | 10154991652248812_10154991659043812 | If you are heart-set on voting for genitalia, then vote Jill Stein. At least that way, you won't be electing all the baggage of terrorist-linked finance and corruption you get with Hillary. You want your sons and daughters to read in the history books about the first woman president actually being worthy of the role and seeing it through to the end without legal issues and possible impeachment.
4 | Pernell Rodocker | 86 | 10154991652248812_10154991681938812 | Hillary Clinton has already lost. Her staff already knows it. Most of her supporters are distancing themselves from her and the campaign against Trump. They don't want to take the fall for her. It will be a great fall!

We can either vote to keep the same corrupt system, the same stagnant economy, and to continue our decline in standing on the world stage, or we can vote for change and send a message that we've had enough of business as usual, that we are tired of the corruption in Washington, and that We The People have had enough. If you think that this is as good as we can do, then vote for Hillary Clinton. If you think that we can rise to greater heights, greater aspirations, and to better our nation for ourselves and our children, vote for Donald J. Trump. The choice is clear.Most importantly get out and vote!!  Your vote can make the difference in what's to come!  Have a good day and thank you for caring about America!

Corrupt wicked people.
19 | Adolph Mejia Jr | 0 | 10154991652248812_10154991956618812 | Just a REMINDER.... How quickly we forget!  If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten.  If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

No BUT we are sick & tired of the career politicians that do NOTHING for us but do everything to line their pockets. If you don't like that he didn't pay taxes - then change the law, if you don't like all these illegals, then change the law. Has he said things he shouldn't have? Yes but he hasn't KILLED anyone, like Hillary. He doesn't have a Pay for Play foundation, Hillary does. As a woman, I can handle being called fat and ugly, what I can't handle is having Hillary get a rapist off and then laugh about it. SHE BELONGS BEHIND BARS. There is PROOF that she has given money to ISIS. What about all the people that "commit suicide". How many people do you know that has committed suicide. I know of 1 but Hillary knows about 27.

14 | Autumn Snead | 2 | 10154991597178812_10154991878998812 | I'll say it and keep saying it I voted today and guess what she DID NOT get my vote today! Mr.Trump will make America great again! He had my vote today! All the women who are voting for her just because she's a woman get your head out of the clouds. I'm a woman and I didn't see I had to vote for her just because she's a female. I do not care of she's a female or male. She's not good for America at all! All the lies she's told and she keeps telling them! I will believe a single word she says. If anything she's gonna get us all killed!
15 | Heather Hester | 4 | 10154991597178812_10154991647838812 | I mean, does she vote for herself? Lol! I was taught to never vote for yourself. Does she just leave it blank? These are questions I need to know!
16 | Paul King | 0 | 10154991597178812_10154992070048812 | I hope the people that voted for or going too vote Hillary have a good 401(k), because if she wins and lets in the people she wants to let in with open borders, you will not have any Social Security. So think about that before you vote.
17 | Russell Parker | 15 | 10154991597178812_10154991622833812 | Remember in the debates when Hillary accused Trump of using some of his foundation money to buy a portrait at a charity auction? She was APPALLED! Well... it turns out the Clinton Foundation paid for Chelsea's wedding. Maybe that fact slipped the lying hypocrite's mind.#DrainTheSwamp
18 | William Toro | 3 | 10154991597178812_10154991639983812 | To read comments like "if you vote for Clinton you deserve to die", is exactly why I didn't vote against trump. His followers now have their renewed hate platform to spew this kind of garbage! This election has brought out the worst in some Americans and rather than disagree and move on prefer to target and hate! This is the sad reality of why it will be hard to unit as a nation tomorrow. How sad!

The tipping point is 20-22 US$ trillion. More people from the Gulf to China will sell the dollar as interest rates are low. As a result 90% of the depreciation of the US dollar is predicted by Gerald Celente ( 2019 end of 2013 to 2019 bull market just like 2003 to 2008) , hyperinflation as dollar would be worthless ( 2019-2031) just like the Russia ( 1991-2003) and food riots ( non-vegetarian food consumes more foodgrains and water as the output is only 10%. Further on Trump would increase borrowings and US will experience a longer and hard landing and Hillary Clinton would engage in wars ( Marc Faber the famed Austrian economist called her a war monger as she funded and trained the ISIS). A bad businessman can be reformed faster than a bad politician.
8 | Judy Kay | 0 | 10154991538708812_10154991553628812 | BREAKING: WIKILEAKS JUST RELEASED FULL ISIS DONOR LIST WITH NAMESBarack Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are the founders of ISIS. We have proven that through emails and documents leaked from WikiLeaks, but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it.After all, they are still more focused on what Trump said eleven years ago than what Hillary has actually done.Because of brave patriots like Julian Assange, we have been given more evidence that Hillary Clinton is more connected to ISIS than we originally believed.An email was leaked between Clinton and John Podesta indicating that: ‚ÄúWestern intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region‚Äù to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of ‚Äúproviding clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.‚ÄùCiting the need to ‚Äúuse our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets,‚Äù said Hillary to Podesta while arguing the current developments in the Middle East were ‚Äúimportant to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country.‚ÄùOdd that Clinton argues Saudi Arabia and Qatar are helping fund ISIS when Hillary‚Äôs largest donations come from those two countries.She Is Funded By Nations That Fund ISIS. Coincidence?In another correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai, set up a meeting with Bill Clinton for five minutes in exchange for a $1,000,000 ‚Äúbirthday check.‚ÄùThe email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would ‚Äúwelcome [the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs] suggestions for investments in Haiti ‚Äî particularly on education and health.‚Äù Desai added that while Qatar had already ‚Äúallocated most of their $20 million ‚Ä¶ [they were] happy to consider projects we suggest.‚Äù

The long-awaited election of 2016 is finally here, and it could be a historic one for a number of different reasons. Here are 10 of the biggest storylines to watch as the results come in.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Peggy Christopher | 83 | 10154991398573812_10154991408168812 | I'll be watching, but I won't be watching it on ABC News! Your biased reporting has left a bad taste in my mouth ...  #TrumpPence2016 #MAGA Go to #FoxNews for fair and balanced reporting of the election!
2 | Alexander Ortiz | 69 | 10154991398573812_10154991399878812 | Atleast Trump didn't need super-delegates and George Soros' money to win his party's nomination. There is a big difference between him and Killary Rodham Clinton. #VoteTrump
3 | Alexander Ortiz | 42 | 10154991398573812_10154991403483812 | Killary Rodham Clinton calls African Americans "super-predators", calls Catholics "severely backwards" and calls Latinos "needy" and yet she tries to paint Donald Trump as a demagogue. She cannot have it both ways. #VoteTrump
4 | Jack Rougeaux | 18 | 10154991398573812_10154991513168812 | The one thing I've learned from this election is ABC can't be trusted to tell the truth an report the correct and honest news and not their own agenda of lies and propaganda.
5 | Alexander Ortiz | 25 | 10154991398573812_10154991407198812 | Killary Rodham Clinton violates the 2009 Federal Records Act by mishandling classified information and deleting 33,000+ emails and  she is allowed to run for President. David Petraeus mishandles classified information and he is court martialed. Give me a break! #VoteTrump
6 | Laurie Miller | 9 | 10154991398573812_10154991489813812 | Everything Crooked Hillary has done all the Lies, E-mails and Corruption she has caused Our Country the real truth will catch up with her just like it finally did after all of her Husbands Affairs he had before his Presidency and when he was Our President he finally was Impeached for Perjury because he was having a Affair with his Intern... One day her Justice will come!!! You can only Run so long
7 | Larry L Spence | 11 | 10154991398573812_10154991459318812 | Today is Our Judgement Day...Only God knows the Outcome and it will be his will...This Country will not Survive 4 more years of Corruption and these political Criminals...Vote for Real Hope & Change..Under a Hillary Clinton Administration:Healthcare costs will skyrocket out of necessity to fund all the illegals getting relief. The system will ultimately collapse and we'll be forced into a single payer system. Socialized Medicine. The goal all along.Lawlessness will reign. The Clinton's will rule the Department of Justice with a compliant Loretta Lynch at the helm. Laws will only apply to the little people while the elites will run wild with no consequence.After much "debate", the Second Amendment will be repealed. An unarmed citizenry is a compliant citizenry. We will become "subjects" instead of citizenry.The economy will continue to crumble. Our pathetic GDP will become "the good old days", as more and more jobs are lost and sent overseas with the TPP.No more borders. We will be flooded by socieltal burdens. Some just lazy; some good, hard working families; some very, very, very bad. It won't take long before we start seeing the results.Say so long to Freedom of Speech. Expect the return of The Fairness Doctrine to silence contrary thought. The UN will be given control of the internet and all "unapproved content" will be banned.The media will become emboldened to lie even more blatantly. They will direct the message for their masters in the White House.The Supreme Court wil be filled with Activist Judges. Our freedoms will gradually disappear. Not all at once. Bit by bit. So we hardly ever notice.She will finish what Obama started. Namely, the destruction of our beloved Republic. I know some don't believe this. But the writing is on the wall. You will see. And like Obama, regrets are an expensive thing.
8 | Emilio Testa | 4 | 10154991398573812_10154991527913812 | The Red Cross pulled their people out of Benghazi before the attacks happened it's really insane that the leaders of the Red Cross has more sense than our Secretary of State What difference does it make at this point? It'll be our lives on the line next Please don't make a big Mistake here VOTE TRUMP
9 | Jennifer Reding | 5 | 10154991398573812_10154991510558812 | Hillary won't destroy America's relationships with Allies as Donald will. Donald is a liar and a pervert. He's stupid. He never answers a question. He says nonsensical things AND he is not TREMENDOUS which is apparently the biggest word he knows although this narcissistic bozo says he's the "smartest, has the biggest vocabulary..." hahahahahahaha What a freaking clown he is and so are his followers.
10 | Teresa Cooper | 10 | 10154991398573812_10154991452258812 | Hillary Supporters, You think you are right about voting for Hillary Clinton, but the children in your family will suffer tremendously in a country with no borders and no guns to protects ourselves. I am assuming that when you go to bed at night that you don't lock your doors and that there is a sign in your yard saying "Come on in", coz that is exactly what Hillary represents for this country. No security while we go about our daily lives and inviting all terrorists, drug smugglers, and hardened criminals to come on in. Shame on you for not thinking about the future of your children a little harder before you made this crucial decision. If she wins, you will see the America you have created for them.
11 | Stephen Vaughan | 4 | 10154991398573812_10154991456203812 | People who still haven't voted: When you go to your voting center ask for paper ballots. Digital voting machines can easily be modified to turn your vote into a Hillary vote no matter who you voted for. Vote smart and your votes will count.
12 | Pernell Rodocker | 1 | 10154991398573812_10154991687468812 | Hillary Clinton has already lost. Her staff already knows it. Most of her supporters are distancing themselves from her and the campaign against Trump. They don't want to take the fall for her. It will be a great fall!

If you‚Äôd like to continue the destruction of our manufacturing base, and the jobs that went with it. If you like the uncontrollable immigration, if you like the string of stupid wars from Iraq to Libya to Syria. If you want to say yes to all of that, if you want to keep this all the way it is, fine, then vote for Hillary Clinton. If you don‚Äôt like the way things are headed you got a chance to really shake the system the system at its roots. If you wake up on Election Day and it‚Äôs the same as it is today, if its the same 4 or 5 or 8 years from now, remember you had a chance really change it up but you were to dainty to do it.
14 | Jennifer Lyn Brande | 1 | 10154991398573812_10154991597578812 | Today is Election Day. Over the last 15 months we have been bombarded by hateful, distasteful and quite frankly outright embarrassing comments, debates, advertisements, and unbelievably horrible and vindictive bashing.I am a firm believer that our two-party system is broken because despite there being more presidential candidates available they are a complete non-factor and I blame the American people for being where we are today, on the precipice of choosing between two unbelievably abhorrent candidates to the highest position in the nation.I fear for this nation and when I go into that booth to vote later I will probably be crying because I know my vote will not count for anything because I'm not voting for either of the major candidates, but hope that my voice and others who are not voting for the major parties will be enough to break up this horrible system we have evolved into. It is so incredibly important to get out and vote today but think about our world reputation and for the future of our nation and vote with a clear conscience that you may have made this nation a bit better.
15 | Renee Schroeder Middagh | 0 | 10154991398573812_10154991989373812 | Shame on ABC news you only put out negative moments for one candidate on your look back. Both sides hade some horrible moments.  P.S. I have not voted yet and will pick the best candidate based on provable fact.  But you are supposed to be neutral and fair and true. Disappointed.
16 | Michael Braxton | 2 | 10154991398573812_10154991534013812 | Bill Clinton gave away millions of jobs with the North American trade agreement which resulted in a recession.The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) dates the beginning of the recession as December 2007. According to the Department of Labor, roughly 8.7 million jobs were shed from February 2008 to February 2010, and GDP contracted by 5.1%, making the Great Recession the worst since the Great Depression.Wikileaks emails have revealed that Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the DNC, provided Hillary Clinton with debate details that would give her an edge over Bernie Sanders.How quickly we forget!  If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten.  If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.   I wish it was.)WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT. (January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

2 | Robin Sewell | 767 | 10154991352743812_10154991366683812 | Wow ...that's a little overboard right there.... I don't believe a stupid election sign needs an electric fence... especially since it's all over after today...and is that their kid climbing on "said" electric fence???
3 | Sarah Moore | 516 | 10154991352743812_10154991375943812 | Trump supporters are really unique. I don't want to use offensive words, but there is something dangerously wrong with 'most' of them. I can't wait for this whole thing to go away. I choose hope and love.
4 | Mitch Schuller | 247 | 10154991352743812_10154991386463812 | The day after the election the story will end up being either him or the kids are accidentally electrocuted because idiot dad thought he turned it off but it wasn't. People are such idiots. Perhaps if they spent just half as much time understanding what their candidate stood for, they wouldn't be so quick to get that sign up.
5 | Chris Finch | 239 | 10154991352743812_10154991366518812 | Lol...what a waste of time, resources, and money....seeing as how he's about to be relegated to the trashcan of political history.....good riddance to bad rubbish
6 | Koral IJuan Mata | 139 | 10154991352743812_10154991411113812 | Aw how adorable a family project. Start teaching your boys that disrespecting others is good.

10 | Matthew Doyle | 50 | 10154991352743812_10154991384793812 | Who would waste money on electric fences to guard their signs? What they do with their money is their business but that's a bit far. Can't they just move their signs a little closer to the lawn??
11 | Siobhan Gaffney | 37 | 10154991352743812_10154991409028812 | Well you can protect his signs all you want but if Donald Trump doesn't like you he won't do anything to protect you let me tell you that for sure. He'll be the new Hitler if he wins.
12 | Paula Adams | 19 | 10154991352743812_1167096556699757 | That is stupid! They could have spent that money on a poor family for Christmas, or donated to a homeless shelter!  Put the damn sign on the roof!
13 | Donna L. Yetman-DeJardine | 24 | 10154991352743812_10154991473478812 | If you have to build an electric fence to protect your TRUMP sign, then that should say everything to you!!! You obviously have more money than brains, lol! Just think what you will have to build if he should become your President! Lord help us all!!!
14 | Gary Ricker | 25 | 10154991352743812_1167093636700049 | Remember folks. If you're voting Trump make sure you show up to the voting booths very early on Wednesday November 9, 2016!

17 | Diana Presley Alver | 10 | 10154991352743812_10154991460293812 | Give me a break. My signs kept getting stolen 8 yrs ago, I just kept replacing them. No need for the media to get involved. More Trump supporters in search of their 15 min of fame.

19 | Denise Walker-Roberts | 19 | 10154991352743812_10154991388173812 | im not voting trump but i like their determination. great job on showing support of their choice. its a shame that some of us felt we shouldn't use signs or bumper stickers anymore. i still have an old Obama bumper sticker on my car. but people are meaner this time and i didn't feel safe putting a Hillary one on my car.
20 | Gil Gall | 9 | 10154991352743812_10154991431698812 | If you have to go to that extreme to protect a sign about your candidate, it's time to reassess your support for the racist, sexist, imbecile that is Donald Trump.
21 | Dexter L. Smith | 7 | 10154991352743812_891618344273138 | I actually don't blame them. People have been stealing and vandalizing Trump yard signs. I proudly and enthusiastically vote for Hillary. But NO ONE has the right to damage another person's property.
22 | Dennis Moore | 17 | 10154991352743812_10154991384428812 | Those signs must be so precious that other Trump supporters without signs would do anything to have one for themselves. Tomorrow it goes back to being a piece of paper.
23 | Jessey Earl | 11 | 10154991352743812_10154991475408812 | So a sign you get for free from any campaign office requires over 100 bucks with of fencing and probably another 60 bucks with of wiring that will be wasted and thrown away after the election...... I've had plenty of campaign signs stolen not once did I think "hey let's electrocute someone for taking my free sign" I just went to whatever headquarters I needed to so I could get a new sign.
24 | Mark Thompson | 12 | 10154991352743812_10154991371748812 | ABC, biased media.. " after they say six signs were stolen " casting doubt on their statements. I see right through your agenda.
25 | Rosalie Gruenemeyer Suggs | 8 | 10154991352743812_10154991387353812 | They could have saved themselves a lot of money by just putting the sign in their front window. When Trump signs began disappearing in our city, that is what residents were told to do.

2 | Greg Amerson | 3 | 10154991265498812_10154991487108812 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

A husband and wife in Omaha, Nebraska, have officially changed their names to Santa and Merry Christmas Claus. "There are smart little kids out there that will say, ‚ÄòLet me see your driver‚Äôs license,‚Äô and now we can do that."

1 | Kasey Rage Kage Jung | 8 | 10154991197228812_10154991305318812 | I have questions. Is Merry the first name and Christmas second? Or are they both first names? Why wouldn't she at least make it Mary so she at least gets a name and not a phrase? Is he going to keep the beard year round? Do they only listen to Christmas music? Just, why? üòÇSStephanie Jables Hall
2 | Chris Byrd | 5 | 10154991197228812_10154991378113812 | I don't think children are typically going around carding people, and kids young enough to believe in Santa don't even know what a driver's license is, or an ID, so... Lame excuse for being silly, or wanting attention, or whatever this is. To each their own.

10 | Ravi Shankar | 1 | 10154991197228812_10154991337313812 | A majority of the world should realize the harmful non-vegetarian food. All animals are bred in captivity and are raised in fear as it makes them release toxins which contain carcinogens which cause Cancer, Parkinson's disease and other modern illnesses that did not exist in the early part of the 20th century. The reason is people used to eat a lot of vegetables, less meat, better family relationships and belief in God. The reason why USA gets attacked by Russia and China in the third world war that begins in 2041 and ends in 2064 after a comet, asteroid and meteor impact Europe and USA is because Americans lose their faith in God. People with belief in God live longer, healthier and have rich family relationships.It was good to see one of your anchors while holding forth a discussion say this year the 2016 is actually 2005. I was the one who predicted through numerology that there were three bull markets in the 21st century from 2003 to 2008, 2013 to 2019 and 2031 to 2037. Even today the companies that I helped from the Tatas and Reliance,etc ( see the section- Cheiro's numerology in my website www.war2037.com) by sending emails...........I did not receive a cent or even a dime pf praise. These channels, companies are controlled by lower castes and they are not unduly praised in our texts. Being a person from a higher caste I should have migrated to the US with my knowledge just like any higher caste and helped the two superpowers the countries of USA and China. That will be my regret.Cotton, Copper ( Metals), Maize, Groundnut, Orange Juice, Coffee will see higher prices together with Tea seeing moderate increase in prices from 1999 ( Jim Rogers predicted the start of the com. bull market) to 2019. Pharma industry has to go generic to meet the low purchasing power of 325 mn Americans ( in 2019) as wealth destruction would be immense. Further Africa will see increase in demand and hence resources will deplete faster. Further on sectors for 2017 and 2018 are Metals, Paper, Autos, Oil Exploration/Gas, Telecom, Sugar, Paints and Textiles. Crude oil is headed higher as it has not seen any new discoveries and terrorism is decreasing in the world with peace in Africa. Gold and precious metals will rise as crisis after crisis hits our shores.

1 | Lillian Young | 22 | 10154991068293812_10154991070808812 | Make America Great Again. Vote for Trump November 28th 2016. Thank you and may God bless you‚úå‚ù§
2 | Alexe C Nwankwo | 1 | 10154991068293812_10154991107983812 | How did the snake managed to get inside the plane? Now if we're turning the snake political. It's obvious that hillary Clinton will win with high merging. Maybe ur racist nd hate Trump should change and prepare for the next election
3 | Shawanna Kendrick | 5 | 10154991068293812_10154991364523812 | I do believe I would have inadvertently started a mannequin challenge all by myself had I been on that plane. I mean I just passed out twice while watching the video with no sound. By the way, if you add sound it magnifies the intensity of the situation. I'll be back. I'm going to get my heart checked.
4 | Kyle Sekenski | 3 | 10154991068293812_10154991538918812 | Everyone should write in Samuel L. Jackson today and vote for him. Not only will he make America great again, but he'll also make our planes snake-free again...
5 | Greg Amerson | 1 | 10154991068293812_10154991488303812 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

From press conferences to ad spending, review the 2016 race to The White House by the numbers: http://abcn.ws/2exBeTk
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Matt Nett | 289 | 10154990973493812_10154990983633812 | No candidate should ever get that much in contributions. So people have money to spend on political hags... yet they refuse to spend a dollar on helping a person in need.
2 | Wess Garcia | 205 | 10154990973493812_10154990988963812 | I like how you had to add 'media gatherings' in order for Hillary to come close to Trump. Her gatherings were not only highly controlled, but her team even controlled the questions the media asked Trump. How long did she go again without a press conference?
3 | Draco Edmonds | 155 | 10154990973493812_10154990991753812 | The money thing alone shows who should be president of the country with a economy that is floundering like ours. Took half the money, and spent almost 2/3rds less while doing the same job
4 | Marina Winter | 146 | 10154990973493812_10154991017523812 | She spent 253 million in tv ads and still is pretty much even to him in poll numbers, that is if they are even true because his rallies were way more populated than hers. That will tell you how much more capable he is. Go Trump!
5 | Shannon Naylor | 63 | 10154990973493812_10154991035523812 | And she will pocket the remaining money raised as her and her families expenses, laundered through their web of crooked organisations.
6 | Mahfuz Haider | 51 | 10154990973493812_10154991061948812 | Donald Trump a racist, liar,sexual predator, fraud,phony who doesn‚Äôt pay taxes for 20 years.He calls for ban of an entire Muslim religion from entering US.He files for bankruptcy 6 times.He calls Mexicans rapists.He makes fun of disabled people.Trump calls global warming a Chinese hoax!Only extremists right-wing, white nationalist want to vote for a idiotic vulgar foul that everybody knows is a stupid!#ImWithHer#Hillary2016
7 | Josh Russell | 33 | 10154990973493812_10154991271123812 | Just goes to show who is more responsible with money. More importantly, other people's money. Think about that tomorrow while your at the booths.
8 | Jorge Rodrigues | 49 | 10154990973493812_10154991033178812 | All those media gatherings must of been on her plane or her bedroom while she napped! ABC must be really delusional since Trumps been holding rally's everyday!
9 | Michele A Baumberger-Smith | 30 | 10154990973493812_10154991050198812 | If you're counting the press conferences Hillary had on her airplane , those don't really count when her press campaign advisor feeds the questions to the reporters.
10 | Kera Pederson | 15 | 10154990973493812_10154991418938812 | Look, just look all over the internet, Hillary is scared, she doesn't want to lose to Trump. But everywhere I look people are supporting Trump because they are tired of the current corrupt system. Hillary is investigated by FBI and money from bad donors with only 1% at interest. She is a killer, nasty woman. I will not vote for her. Get some real journalists like Tomi Lahren!!! So glad that after today the ads stop. If Killary wins we are screwed.
11 | Lisa Patterson | 14 | 10154990973493812_10154991295748812 | I'm just amazed at how people just believe whatever Trump says. They don't check facts. They just assume that he's telling the truth. Yet the man lies almost all the time. They believe everything he says about himself and everything he says about Hillary and they don't seem to check anything. It's obvious as they are so off on the facts. People, please educate yourself before you vote.
12 | Todd Priest | 17 | 10154990973493812_10154990987648812 | And the fact that this is going to be a very close election is a statement of how sad this country has become. Out of all the candidates that we could have had, we are stuck with these two idiots.
13 | Caridad Promes | 14 | 10154990973493812_10154991106943812 | There is no other country in the world wasting that much money on bullcrap! There are people living under the bridge, people can't afford healthcare. This is insane!!!
14 | Alan Shelton | 15 | 10154990973493812_10154991275753812 | Today is the day, all we can do now is pray that Trump wins or we will see our beloved Nation become part of the Third World and completely unable to defend its self. All of you undecideds get out today and vote Trump. Hillary is a Criminal and a big part of what is wrong in America today. Please go VOTE TRUMP.
15 | Anita Mueller Covington | 14 | 10154990973493812_10154991282248812 | Wow!  With that kind of money being spent, you would think we could have Universal healthcare, Veterans be cared for, homeless off the streets, all kids fed and clothed! !
16 | Kathleen Baumiller | 10 | 10154990973493812_10154991337328812 | This process needs to be changed! That is a ridiculous amount of money and doesn't take into account the millions spent on the senate races. This money could be better spent on our country's needs
17 | Sue Ann Robinson | 3 | 10154990973493812_10154991593598812 | That's a Lie,  Trump held many press conferences from the Beginning.  Hillary waited until the last moment so she didn't have to answer Email and Benghazi and other criminal questions.
18 | Brian Woody | 5 | 10154990973493812_10154991105818812 | I live in Florida and there will be a Clinton ad, a Trump ad right after and another Clinton ad all in a row LOL.

19 | Gary Plummer | 24 | 10154990973493812_10154990979953812 | Bigotry, hatred, racism, misogyny, fear, dishonesty, bankruptcy, tax avoidance, sexual assaults and cowardice have never made any nation great ever and they never will. These are Trumps only characteristics!
20 | Ned Kelly | 5 | 10154990973493812_10154991548088812 | That graphic is not true. How can the media legally just make things up? ABC NEWS your reputation is damaged beyond repair. You're a joke and have the credibility of the National Enquirer. Ethically, Muir is below Jerry Springer.
21 | Carol Cardaci Cuccia | 5 | 10154990973493812_10154991303493812 | Who are you kidding, press conference from the lying liberal...when where how, lying, spinning, cheating, just like her.and that's why I don't watch any news on ABC CBS NBC AND WON'T...
22 | Jeannieand Ken | 12 | 10154990973493812_10154991178738812 | How many millions went to the entertainment at her rally's ?? Beyonc√© Jay Z Bruce Springsteen?  Do you really believe they did it for free?
23 | Amber Cheney | 7 | 10154990973493812_10154990982323812 | So much for wanting to help the less fortunate. Imagine how many this could have helped. That publicity alone would have kept a candidate in the headlines. To much is spent on elections in this country.
24 | Makayla Faye Craddock | 0 | 10154990973493812_10154992021498812 | She spent a lot of money on ads that are a bunch of money. Hahaha! If she can't learn how to be responsible for money, she can't be responsible for presidency. Trump knows how to save money unlike Hillary. Trump is more educated and smart.üòÇüòÇ

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email system rather than a government-run account while serving as secretary of state has been a major sticking point throughout the presidential campaign.

1 | Sarah Creutzinger | 102 | 10154990922218812_10154990963068812 | I have always wanted a female president... she is NOT who I want as our first female president. She lies about everything, sounds like she is searching for answers when she speaks and stayed with a man who essentially abused and cheated on her. She has the resources, money and support to leave and instead she chose to threaten and coerce bills other women inti dropping charges against him. While I don't necessarily love everything trumps platform is based upon, I'd rather give him a chance. Hillary has her chance, and then had another and another. She's a weak pathetic woman who stayed with her husband while he abused other women's rights. She's pathetic. When she was practicing law, Hillary Clinton defended a man who raped a 12 year old girll. She tore the little girl apart on the stand, got the rapist off with a light sentence and later laughed about it with a reporter.What message would it send to young women if someone as corrupt, dishonest and incompetent as Hillary Clinton were elected President? That morals don‚Äôt matter? That you should hang in there with a husband who‚Äôs banging everyone in town but you because it may benefit you? It's absolutely disgusting. She thinks she is above the law. For Christ's sake, she's nearly 69 and hasn't driven a car in, um, almost 20 years. She's out of touch with the American people, she stole money intended to go to my close friends in Haiti where I have been multiple times to install solar grids with work and provide clean drinking water initiatives and she lied about things that shouldn't even allow her clearance with the president let alone allow her to walk the streets freely and not sit behind bars. I surely do not want her as a role model for my daughter...

The republicans cut spending even after the embassies asked for more help and security. The republicans admitted that military couldn't reach there in time.

The system will ultimately collapse and we'll be forced into a single payer system. Socialized Medicine. The goal all along.Lawlessness will reign. The Clinton's will rule the Department of Justice with a compliant Loretta Lynch at the helm.

Our pathetic GDP will become "the good old days", as more and more jobs are lost and sent overseas with the TPP.No more borders. We will be flooded by socieltal burdens.

Expect the return of The Fairness Doctrine to silence contrary thought. The UN will be given control of the internet and all "unapproved content" will be banned.The media will become emboldened to lie even more blatantly. They will direct the message for their masters in the White House.The Supreme Court wil be filled with Activist Judges. Our freedoms will gradually disappear. Not all at once. Bit by bit.

I get suspicious when someone like him runs for office, for a salary of 400k a year, and he's suppose to be a billionaire, he's all I it to gain power to benefit him, he's already been not paying taxes, he uses the system to file bankruptcies. I don't understand why anyone wants him to run the economics of our country, his temperament is another issue, I just don't think he would diplomatic, and could risk hurting our relationships with our allies. He just made this election unbearable for folks. I'll be glad when it's over.

Jobs CreationAt the top of Clinton‚Äôs first-term to-do list is revitalizing the employment market, an undertaking she hopes to accomplish with her 100-Days Jobs Plan. The strategy, which she has touted as ‚Äúthe biggest investment in new good-paying jobs since World War II,‚Äù would create 10.4 million jobs during her first term, according to Moody‚Äôs Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi. With this strategy, Clinton has vowed to:‚Ä¢ Invest in infrastructure, manufacturing and clean energy, putting Americans back to work in industries that rebuild the country.‚Ä¢ Strengthen trade agreement enforcement to keep U.S. jobs from moving overseas.‚Ä¢ Cut taxes and remove red tape to fuel small business growth.‚Ä¢ Dedicate resources to research and innovation that will create new industries of the future.Trump, who prides himself on having created thousands of jobs as a businessman‚Äîupwards of 34,000, according to a CNNMoney analysis‚Äîhas sworn to be ‚Äúthe greatest jobs president that God ever created.‚Äù During a September 15, 2016, speech at the Detroit Economic Club. However, facts to consider‚Ä¶‚Ä¢ He bought the Trump Plaza hotel for $400 million and it was repossessed by the bank.‚Ä¢ He bought his yacht for $29 million and it was repossessed by the bank.‚Ä¢ He built 4 casinos at a cost of $3 million and filed for bankruptcy then went out of business.‚Ä¢ Started Trump Airlines and never made a profit.‚Ä¢ Trump Mortgage, Trump Vodka, & Trump Steaks ‚Äì All went out of business.He shared his plan to add 25 million jobs to the market over the next 10 years. His strategy, albeit devoid of many details, involves:‚Ä¢ Negotiating fair trade deals that will lead to more jobs on U.S. soil.‚Ä¢ Narrowing America‚Äôs trade deficit and increasing domestic production.‚Ä¢ Reducing taxes on businesses so products can be sold more easily around the world.‚Ä¢ Replacing bureaucrats who ‚Äúonly know how to kill jobs‚Äù with jobs-creation experts.‚Ä¢ Reviewing regulations, like the EPA‚Äôs Clean Power Plan, and repealing the Obama administration‚Äôs executive actions, like the Climate Action Plan, which inhibit hiring.Now, think about it‚Ä¶

And while working class people are all paying taxes, he calls us stupid because he's never paid any taxes! That right there, it's a reason to not vote for him! He wants to continue the loopholes for the very rich like him so he'll never have to pay taxes! He won't do one darn thing for the working class if he gets in office.  Don't forget this fact when you vote.

"The senator taught us that if we want things to change, if we want to fight against the status quo, we have to start at the grassroots level...this is a process that doesn't end on November 8. We're going to work to keep people engaged, so we'll see a new generation of Bernie-crats in cycles to come."

5 | Dan Jensen | 0 | 10154990855323812_10154992202713812 | Laughing hysterically. This individual turned turtle and emphatically endorsed the very same candidate that manipulated the system to screw him over... as soon as he was told to. There aren't many more glaring examples of being a puppet of the "system" than Sanders. The only bigger jokes are the jokers that still trust this bloke and take him seriously. Bernie's movement turned into a leftist bowel movement.

14 | Greg Amerson | 2 | 10154990855323812_10154991490543812 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

That's all they know what to do. They have been in politics all their lives. They don't know what you need for your family and your family's future and the future of America.They don't know what you need to be happy and the happiness of your family. They love to be in power.

The man is a joke, and anyone that believes anything from this puppet's mouth is just as niave as those who think Killary is a good wholesome person. This man pried on the heartstrings of the most idiotic babyish generation of our existence, and now the millennials think they are something special. News flash kiddos, you weren't part of anything but an old obsolete man lining his pockets before the real change comes. Have fun when your government honey goes away, and you are forced to man up and get a job like the real Americans.

If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.) Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign. However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency. Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours. Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House. Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents. Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?  But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?

She is trying everything racism, division, making Hollywood videos with the famous Islamic supporter and actor Mr. Khan. It is insulting to the public. Hillary, You've been exposed! You, and the entire criminals called government. Hillary is a criminal, a proven liar and unfit to be president. She will only further her corruptions and put America for sale.

We need someone new with ideas and has stamina and strength. Not somebody who is constantly resting at her house, and having everybody else campaign for her. We need TRUMP because we don't need a tax increase, or an increase of illegal immigrants. We need lower taxes and have borders! What is a country without borders? The world is already eating our country economically dry. We need a businessman who will make trades with other countries and bring our economy back. I voted for Trump. We need to make America Great Again! Vote for TRUMP! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

As they say once a snake always a SNAKE,. Donald Trumps crude words are just words. Bill and Hillary Clintons actions as well as nonactions are far worse than anything Trumps ever been accused of and no doubt the lesser of the two evils. Wake up America!!
10 | Devon Stoddard | 0 | 10154990756163812_10154991840588812 | DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCEMENT ~ REGARDING THE NEWSWEEK REPORT:TRUMP IS A ‚ÄúHUGE‚Äù NATIONAL SECURITY RISK BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL TIES TO RUSSIA, CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN, ETC‚Ä¶..In a stunning and damning expose just released, the truth behind the ties between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are revealed, and American allies in Europe are growing increasingly concerned by Russian espionage and its interference in the U.S. election.A Friday Newsweek article by Kurt Eichenwald reveals the truth behind the Trump campaign and its ties to Russia‚Äôs President Vladimir Putin. It also shows the history behind Russia‚Äôs support of the Republican candidate through espionage and cyberattacks discovered by both U.S. and allied European intelligence agencies.According to Eichenwald, American allies are concerned about Russian interference in the U.S. election and that Donald Trump‚Äôs statements denying any collusion in recent cyberattacks have only encouraged Putin to become more aggressive in his espionage against Western countries. Eichenwald cites the input of government officials, law enforcement officers, and intelligence agencies in both the U.S. and Europe.According to information gained by Western allied intelligence sources, the Kremlin‚Äôs interference into the U.S. election is aimed more at crippling Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in revenge for what Putin felt was interference in Russian elections. Clinton‚Äôs statement in 2011, saying the Russian election was ‚Äúneither free nor fair‚Äú in regards to obvious cheating, has sent Putin into a rage and made him determined to destroy Clinton. Putin was also enticed by Trump‚Äôs compliments of his strength as a leader.Some of the information gained by Western intelligence sources reveal that Donald Trump has been surrounded by a number of advisers with ties to Putin or with financial and family ties to Russia. Former campaign manager Paul Manafort was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had ties to a pro-Russian Ukraine official. Carter Page, another former Trump adviser, is being investigated by U.S. and European intelligence agencies for engaging in back-channel discussions with Russian officials. Intelligence has also revealed that Trump adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn is intimately tied to RT, a Russian news agency involved in distributing Russian propaganda.Donald Trump and his campaign have also been found to be spreading Russian propaganda. The Kremlin has been distributing misinformation as part of their normal activities via various networks, through both anonymous internet trolls, RT, and Sputnik, another propaganda news source. A manipulated document from one of the anonymous internet sources found itself being recited by Trump at a campaign rally. The campaign has also been spreading rumors from Sputnik, including a piece attacking Newsweek that was forwarded by Trump staff to a number of reporters in the U.S. with requests that those reporters pursue the false story.In accordance with his position as presidential nominee, U.S. intelligence agencies have briefed Trump about Russia‚Äôs attempts to influence the election, but Trump has persisted in publicly denying these serious allegations, calling them unreliable, and dismissing them as possibly being perpetrated by some ‚Äú400-pound guy sitting on their bed‚Äù or even a child.European officials have told Newsweek that Trump‚Äôs statements have alarmed our NATO partners, because Trump refuses to believe the intelligence briefings he received or simply doesn‚Äôt understand them. They are also convinced that Trump could be misleading the American people for reasons of his own.One British official said that members of the U.K. government who are fully aware of Russia‚Äôs interference find Trump‚Äôs response ‚Äúquite disturbing.‚Äù They‚Äôre concerned that should he be elected, Trump would ignore and dismiss his own and allied intelligence services.Western law enforcement and intelligence agencies say that the Russian hacking and disinformation campaign includes tens of thousands of people in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk. They say there are also operations inside the United States, working from New York City, Miami, and Washington D.C., mainly using Russian immigrants, although other foreign nationals and American citizens are also involved. According to intelligence received, those involved are being paid via a Russian pension scheme. One U.S. official told Newsweek that evidence shows that many of the Americans and other foreign nationals involved are unaware that they are part of Russia‚Äôs propaganda machine.American intelligence is also aware that Russia used cyber espionage and propaganda to interfere with other elections in the West, including the German elections last month and the June Brexit vote in the U.K., the results of both of which weakened the ties between those countries and the EU and NATO.According to a European intelligence expert, Russia is releasing its disinformation to disrupt the U.S. election through WikiLeaks, but states that the ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù through which the information flows contains numerous steps and so many filters that it is likely that the WikiLeaks organization itself does not know the source of the information.Interestingly enough, despite the Russian president‚Äôs support of Donald Trump, at one point, support for the Republican nominee was halted due to his volatile and unstable nature. According to intelligence sources, the Kremlin backed off supporting Trump when he attacked the Kahn Gold Star family publicly. The Kremlin assumed that the nominee would be forced to withdraw from the race due to his psychological unfitness, so put the hacking campaign on hold. According to reports provided to Western intelligence sources, even Putin thought Trump was unfit to be president, despite the advantages to him of a Trump presidency.According to information provided to Western intelligence agencies, Putin is satisfied that his campaign of cyber espionage has turned the tide in his direction. Putin has told his associates that even if Clinton wins the White House, she will be too busy rectifying the chaos that his leaked misinformation has wrought to interfere with his plans in Syria, Ukraine, and elsewhere.European allies are particularly stunned by Donald Trump‚Äôs refusal to credit his own intelligence services, and British officials were particularly horrified when Trump dismissed the validity of those sources. According to one British official the most disturbing evidence of Trump‚Äôs negligence was during the third presidential debate. In rebuttal to Clinton‚Äôs accusation that he was encouraging Russian cyberattacks, Trump said that she had no idea where the cyberattacks were coming from.‚ÄòHillary, you have no idea‚Ä¶ Our country has no idea.‚ÄôAccording to Newsweek, all of our intelligence sources and those of our NATO allies know that Russia is behind the hacking. Although Trump has been briefed, he continues to dismiss the information. Eichenwald sums up the exposes with some chilling thoughts:‚ÄòShould the United States, the last remaining superpower, tilt its policies away from NATO to the benefit of Russia, the alliance between America and Western Europe could be transformed in unprecedented ways. And so, for perhaps the first time since World War II, countries in Western Europe fear that the American election, should Trump win, could trigger events that imperil their national security and do potentially irreparable harm to the alliances that have kept the continent safe for decades.‚ÄôIF YOU CARE, SHARE!

We don't respect the Lord, Our Government, the laws, our Police, our Vets, the life of the unborn child in the womb, our Parents, our self and each another.We have a candidate Hillary Clinton who wants to be our President but she doesn't respect the law. What is this teaching our children? That there is no consequences for such behavior. You can lie, sneak, and deceive. How can one trust and look up to someone like this? Hillary is not worthy to be our Commander and Chief.In a couple of hours the polls will be opening and we all are left with a decision that is so very important to our families and a life changer to America.Don't stay home today and say I can't vote, pray, be a voice, to stand up for you future, your Country, your children and to fight for a better world, because your life does depends on it.Is Donald Trump a perfect candidate? Absolutely not. Is there a chance he could screw things up? Sure. But is it possible that he‚Äôs been placed in this position to do great things, expose the corruption, improve this country‚Äôs standing in the world, get our economy back on track, and help turn back the progressive tide in this country that is threatening our way of life in America? It sure is.And that‚Äôs why Donald Trump gets my vote.
