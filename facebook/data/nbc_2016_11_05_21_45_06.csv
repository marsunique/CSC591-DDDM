7 | Cheryl Ann | 149 | 1558987420787949_1558992720787419 | And then his followers went violent on the media - nothing good ever comes from Trump and anything he does or says

12 | Barbara Smith Teatero | 26 | 1558987420787949_1559002334119791 | That's what happens when you incite violence, sometimes it backfires.  On the other hand when a DT supporter tried to incite when POTUS was speaking, Obama showed him respect!
13 | FredCandy Quinney | 8 | 1558987420787949_1559005540786137 | The ignorance of Hillary supporters is truly amazing. It's hard to believe so called educated people can be so ignorant and duped into being a lemming marching off a cliff.

Along with abortion, innocent babies taken bc people like you think they don't deserve a chance, I wish some of your parents thought about aborting you during the 9 month a few weeks before you were due.
22 | Cindy Singer Thomas | 4 | 1558987420787949_1559009257452432 | I'm not a Trump supporter, but stuff like this is ridiculous!  If you have a problem with a candidate, carry your behinds to a polling station and vote!
23 | Solomon Xavier Tolley | 5 | 1558987420787949_1559001937453164 | When you invite violence, you shouldn't be surprised, and you shouldn't be given special protection just because you're a "rich" Cheeto hellbent on making life suck for anyone who's not a skinny, straight, white, cis, Christian male.

You call this qualified? Clinton cannot follow basic laws. A lifetime of controversy. Distorted so called Trump's issues are petty compared to Clinton's actions. Clinton has become a multi millionaire through unethical, shady, and maybe illegal means.Trump has become a multi billionaire through ethical and legal means. (any significant wrong doing or finding against Trump would be front page news 24/7. Most of the minor accusations of wrong doing are false, spun or made up, or settled. Anti Trump people are desperate for dirt). Trump, a Global Business Leader (whether you have an appreciation for what that is or not) has a history of mostly success. Clinton, a career politician has a history of mostly failure. I look at accomplishments and performance, not rhetoric. Business leaders compete daily. Politicians compete at election time. Seek truth. The self serving government cartel needs to end. Our country is desperate for a real leader that will serve the people.

Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the fantastic Trump Strong t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/trumpstrong .And let's Make America Great Again!

According to investigative journalist Jerome Corsi, what Clinton and her close associates have done is “an obvious violation of the law”…But this isn’t the only investigation that could lead to a Hillary Clinton indictment.  According to Fox News Channel’s Bret Baier, the FBI investigation into corruption at the Clinton Foundation is also “likely to lead to an indictment”…TRUTH It's the new hate speech"During times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act."

Brent Bozell III.  Commenting on the fact that at least two FBI sources have disclosed that a criminal indictment of the Clinton Foundation is likely and yet the networks ABC, CBS, and NBC are not reporting this news confirms there is a "media cover-up," a network "blackout," said Media Research Center Brent Bozell in a statement on Thursday.“The networks’ blackout of the news that two FBI sources said there will ‘likely’ be indictments related to the Clinton Foundation is beyond the pale," said Bozell."If there was a report about likely indictments related to the Trump Foundation, there would be an immediate flash mob of reporters camped in front of Trump Tower breaking away from regularly scheduled programming and offering play-by-play commentary," he said.  "No one in the so-called ‘news’ media can deny this without lying through his/her teeth," said Bozell, whose media watchdog group has been documenting, exposing, and neutralizing liberal media bias for 29-plus years."The stench of corruption between the Justice Department, the State Department and the Clinton Foundation machine and now the leftist ‘news’ media is overpowering," he said.  "This is a media cover-up."

4 | Adam Wise | 7 | 1558937434126281_1558949477458410 | I can't believe that so many people have been swindled by this pipeline protest. As if it has anything to do with the environment. It's about money people. The tribe wanted too much money for the rights to lay the pipeline through reservation land, so the pipeline company went around them. Now they're protesting it crossing north of the reservation to try and force the pipeline to go through their land and cross the river further south. Then of course they'll get paid. It's just about greed.

7 | Nick Grasso | 1 | 1558937434126281_1558980920788599 | The pipeline is on private property on the same path as an existing gas line installed in 1982. The corps of engineers asked the tribe to sit down 6 times to discuss any concerns, but they refuse all 6 times. It was not sacred ground in 1982, and it's still not sacred ground. Just a convenient excuse. To top it off, George Soros is paying democracy now protesters to start problems. It really is a non story.

2 | Patricia Woods | 18 | 1558892947464063_1558914477461910 | This man purchased all that land only to make it a burial ground, they stopped a serial killer in the making if he already hadn't started, scary right here in S.C.!
3 | Mary Guillen | 3 | 1558892947464063_1558938020792889 | PBD might be just one diagnosis could be much more. Prison wasn't the answer should have been in a long term mental health facility for criminal offenders. He might have stayed longer in custody. People need to understand, that most offenders will not be locked up for life. They all eventually come back out to the community. The Local authorities should have been aware and monitoring him. Wasn't he required to register as a sex offender?

2 | Kate Arbore | 720 | 1558821167471241_1558823664137658 | Oops, is Jay Z running for president? Or talking about sexually assaulting women?? Oh, right. No, and no. Shut up and crawl back in your hole.
3 | Michael Raymond Gall | 833 | 1558821167471241_1558822457471112 | So he goes on Howard Stern in the past and he complains of an artists language? Is Jay Z running for  President?
4 | Catheigh Rizzo | 448 | 1558821167471241_1558823407471017 | He's delusional!!!! HIS mouth is disgusting!!  What a hypocrite!! Goodbye douche ! Can't wait to watch you lose!! THEN we will hear HIS language about how rigged everything is 😂😂 Jay Z isn't running for president!! This coming from a man that says "grab that pussy"
5 | Marissa Peart | 410 | 1558821167471241_1558824310804260 | Isn't this the same guy who's always cursing at his rallies and promoting violence against others? You and your wife must be running for the irony award
6 | Kate Riggs | 196 | 1558821167471241_1558826124137412 | Yes since Pussy is such a great word. Can he please stop attacking everyone. I'm so sick of hearing him say awful things at every single person in the country. Be careful, if you criticize him he will threaten a lawsuit!!! It's his only defense. That and his middle school behavior!!! To bad money can't buy him any class!!!!
7 | Andre Morell | 155 | 1558821167471241_1558828310803860 | Jay Z got 99 problems, but grabbing pussy ain't one...I understand you got girl problems I feel bad for you son, 99 problems but grabbing pussy ain't one.....
8 | Mike Williams | 138 | 1558821167471241_1558822744137750 | Imagine if Trump would have had a rapper who sang about bi***** and ho**... at his rally..lol the world would have exploded
9 | Cindy Brown | 145 | 1558821167471241_1558827174137307 | Let me get this straight....you can openly to thousands of people and on National TV, tell people to go F......themselves and JZ has the potty mouth?   Your pathetic.
10 | Pedro Alejandro Alvarez Santiago | 121 | 1558821167471241_1558828174137207 | I find it ironic for Trump to talk about anyone else's bad language, hey Trump, we know all about your dirty language so don't even bother. #iamwithHer
11 | Amy Serrano | 69 | 1558821167471241_1558831824136842 | Trump is just jealous, Jay Z has built his own empire, no huge start up loans from daddy, and he continues to make money not lose it, not filing bankruptcy, and can pay his bills and doesn't have to stiff people!!!
12 | Melinda Echols | 32 | 1558821167471241_1558821680804523 | If an American votes for a candidate just because he/she loves, loves, loves the celebrities paid to entertain, take off your star stuck glasses and come back to reality. Celebrities get paid to entertain NOT win you over on who to vote for in a Presidential Election. Wake up America! Celebrities are invited to the White House State Dinner, YOU won't be.
13 | Kerrigan Womack | 38 | 1558821167471241_1558832557470102 | Nobody's asking the complainers to buy Jay-Z's album. He's not running for president but you want us to elect king cheeto when he wants to grab women by the privates?! Hilarious
14 | Chris Momdjian | 29 | 1558821167471241_1558832607470097 | Interesting, when Trump was caught on tape his supporters defended him saying he was just using bad language and we don't need a boy scout for president but a rapper cursing is offensive to him?
15 | Stephen Mckiernan | 15 | 1558821167471241_1558835957469762 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.
16 | Mark Hockett | 23 | 1558821167471241_1558836874136337 | Donald Trump should be the last one in the world to ever talk about someone's language. Because he's said a hell of a lot worse than anyone. And it's obvious that he doesn't know anything about the Constitution because Jay Z has the right say what he wants to say. But at least he's not sexually assaulting women or encouraging violence against people or throwing a temper tantrum like petulant child.

18 | Michelle Delude | 6 | 1558821167471241_1558835694136455 | oh yes, and bill clinton openly screws women while in office....at least trump was behind closed doors and was recorded without his knowledge while talking with another guy...like all guys do when they are together......and then we have hillary and lets see all those emails and all that money spent on themselves.....well guess democratics are  worse......and then again, we have the democratics letting all those refugees in that rape children and stone women....I will vote for Mr. Trump!!!

23 | Jc Chavez | 12 | 1558821167471241_1803864473190014 | I'm with Hillary Clinton because FACTS do matter. She is brilliant and honestly does the work to provide better policies. I am amazed at the people who say she's a criminal. Based on what? Hearsay? We are a country of laws and very few people could withstand 30 yrs of investigations and have zero arrests or convictions. She's good, but she's not magical and the naysayers are buying into the lies. Thank goodness Beyonce and J understand the long term implications of not having a prepared and intelligent leader.
24 | Brandon Jones | 5 | 1558821167471241_1278490805554663 | She needs big names to draw people in.. Only problem is just like the other day., right after the concert was over the big crowds left.. They didn't show up for her, just the show.. Even liberals don't want to hear her speeches.. Fact
25 | Melanie Smith-Dehorta | 5 | 1558821167471241_1803879939855134 | Jay-Z may have 99 problems but Trump aint one! Nobody should take trump seriously. He is a terrible republican candidate and an embarrassment to the country.

1 | Mark Thomas Hastings | 67 | 1558770364142988_1558780007475357 | Lance Armstrong was a hero after winning the Tour de France multiple times.  That is, until people found out he cheated.  He went outside of the rules and his fall from heroic to cheater was swift.  Hillary should be judged the same way.  She received the questions prior to at least one or more debates (there aren't that many debates), she and her campaign planted violent protestors at Trump rallies, and fabricated things like a Russian connection later proved inaccurate.  In addition, she was exposed for corruption in many areas along the way.  How can Americans stand by her side?  She won't be my President, just as Lance is no longer our bicycle champ, due to all of this...no matter the outcome.  Winning without cheating is graceful and the opposite is disgraceful
2 | Esther Romo Trevino | 40 | 1558770364142988_1558788487474509 | I read the whole article...its bad either way. BUT medicare n social security are NOT entitlements, we paid our whole life for our MEDICARE N SOCIAL SECURITY RETIREMENT FUNDS AS DID OUR EMPLOYERS!

4 | Joanie Einaoj | 16 | 1558770364142988_1558806660806025 | This is one of the reasons trump will NOT get my vote: TaxesUnder Clinton's tax plan, 90 percent of the tax increase will be borne to people in the 1 percent tax bracket or higher. The top 0.1 percent will have about an $805,000 tax increase, and she says she'll extend a tax cut to the bottom 80 percent.Related: Who are Trump and Clinton's Smart Money Picks to Head Treasury?Trump would like to cut individual tax rates across board and decrease the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. He'd also allow businesses that don't pay the corporate tax (like partnerships and "flow-throughs") to elect to be treated as a business instead of being taxed at the individual rate, thereby saving money.A recent report from the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group in Washington, D.C., cited by Weiner shows the typical "1 percenter" with an average tax cut of $214,000 under the Trump tax plan. Almost half of his total tax cuts go to people in the top 1 percent. As for the top 0.1 percent? They'd see taxes reduced by an average $1.1 million cut.
5 | David Halahmy | 22 | 1558770364142988_1558774734142551 | In just a few days our nation will take a another step back. Regardless of who is our next president. We have endured 8 years of rising debt (from 10 -20 trillion), growing Islamic radicalism, massive increases to our heath care and sadly a more divided nation then I have ever seen in my life. And neither of the two folks who will be sitting in the white house will do much about those issues. But I still have hope that one day our nation will find its path again. Neither Hilary or Trump will make your life better. That is up to you. I suggest a heavy dose of individual responsibility for the next stage of American History. If you work hard, be a good husband, wife, neighbor you will hopefully stay on your feet. It will be a historic day, we will elect a reality t.v. star celebrity to be president, or a person under FBI investigation who should be indicted. I pray one day our nation will find its exceptionalism again. And no one should look at either of these people as a "role model"

They don't understand what will happen when we are a One World Order, a Socialist nation that will run every aspect of their lives with regulations and take more of their money. Free college? Who is paying for free college? Help blacks and Latino, she has had thirty years to do it, what makes you believe her. She has had too many scandals to list here, too many lies, and then there are all the FBI investigations, all this doesn't matter, just that she is a woman and she is Democrat.
18 | Steve Thames | 4 | 1558770364142988_1558812227472135 | Is this true? Hillary’s Niece Is Voting For Donald Trump On Tuesday“I have been a Democrat my entire life, but Trump is what we need right now — somebody who is going to stand up for us. I think at this point Hillary just wants it for the history books — to be the first woman president for selfish reasons,” the 25-year-old Tampa hairstylist continued.Smit said that she’d never met Clinton, partly because she believes that side of the family looks down on her.

20 | Leslie Kay Kolhoff | 0 | 1558770364142988_1558890214131003 | Of course t-rumps numbers on jobs and tax cuts are entirely inflated. In his book he says he does this intentionally all the time. Reason? It sells. (always the barf bag salesman)
21 | David Gregory | 0 | 1558770364142988_1558904387462919 | Trumps contrived "trickle down" Keynesian scam to shove all cash to a few at the top works for him and a few large corporate pals but once again drives the shaft to Worker America.
22 | Betty Lamp | 0 | 1558770364142988_1558991527454205 | So you think you aren't voting or you think they are both the same... consider this: Trump has never shared government secrets, he has never heard 4 Americans beg for help and send no help, in fact, order men going to help to turn back... so they die! Then lie to the American people and the parents and loved ones of those men about how they died! Trump has never sold 30% of americas uranium to Russia, trump didn't double our national debt. Trump didn't put a private server in the basement of his house to hide what he was doing from the American people! Trump hasn't funded ISIS! .... I could go on and on. But, no! Trump didn't do all these things..... HILLARY AND THE DEMOCRATS DID!!!!! It's time we the people ran this country, not the big money elites!!! Trump said he won't take a salary while Obama spent $65,000 of taxpayer money to supply pizza and hot dogs be flown in from Chicago for one of his private parties!!! I can tell you right now, trump would never do that. Oh, but trump said a mean thing.... right. WAKE UP AMERICA!!!!!

24 | Jotsarup Singh | 2 | 1558770364142988_1558859167467441 | Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (and has cheated on his wives). Elect him. Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. Put her in jail. 2 Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem. Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State).  So savvy... Put him in the white house. Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz. Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible. Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is. Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support him and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact. Your memes are not news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform.#trumpisapieceofshit
25 | Terri Leighton | 0 | 1558770364142988_1558813344138690 | So an article in, The Economist, this week stated that Hillary's plan will increase taxes to ALL households over $250K..... That's two working parents, taxed at 35%, 2 cars with payments and insurance, state excise tax, possibly/probably a mortgage, interest, property taxes, etc.....with maybe two kids that will never qualify for student aid.... That is well below the Top 1% in any State in the country....Does this sound like "millionaires or billionaires," to anyone?

I don't like Hillary Clinton and it pains me to cast my vote for her but I am legitimately worried about Donald Trump having that responsibility though.
2 | Patti Lewis | 58 | 1558741194145905_1558769854143039 | There are so many misinformed people thinking trumps the answer...wrong..if he doesn't start a nuclear war which would be the end of the world. We would under putin control.. you don't admire a dictator...get real

5 | Chip Bailey | 22 | 1558741194145905_1558755940811097 | Donald Trump will be the best President to prevent a nuclear war because other leaders will respect him and not back him into a corner. Hillary will ruin us.

Its everything bad if Clinton doesn't win...or the Media who' obvious bias is so bad the phrase it ain't paranoia if they really are out to get you actually is true...Or the video of Hilary's henchmen's saying they had paid people to be violent at trumps rally which kinda proves you don't like the constitution (the nasty free speech and right to assemble thing ya know). With all that why wouldn't they be stocking food .Heck I should be stocking food!

1 | Denise A Spencer | 6 | 1558679844152040_1558711614148863 | It is the oligarch like Trump that pays the republican and conservative politicians to write our tax policy for their benefit. This is the corrupt fascist policy that republicans have pushed for 50 years. Democrats and progressives stand for freedom, labor rights and fair markets in policy.

According to investigative journalist Jerome Corsi, what Clinton and her close associates have done is “an obvious violation of the law”…But this isn’t the only investigation that could lead to a Hillary Clinton indictment.  According to Fox News Channel’s Bret Baier, the FBI investigation into corruption at the Clinton Foundation is also “likely to lead to an indictment”…TRUTH It's the new hate speech"During times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act."

1 | Adem Tumbo | 2 | 1558462230840468_1558666267486731 | You believe that none is perfect except God The Almighty. You believe that you are the change that America needs. Go and vote for Hillary. You believe in love. Vote for Hillary Clinton. You believe in tolerance. You believe in sobriety. Vote for Hillary Clinton. You believe in Progress. You believe in a stronger American economy. You believe in harmony, peace and better security in your neighborhood. Then vote for Hillary Clinton. You believe that together, we are one, our political diversity is our strength. Vote for Hillary Clinton. You believe in forgiveness of sins. You believe that America is the greatest country in the planet Earth. Then vote for Hillary Clinton. You believe that everyone in this country can work harder to make America even better. You believe that Americans and American President must be accepted by the all countries in the Face of The Planet. Then vote for Hillary Clinton. But if you believe that one person can finish America problems, vote for Trump. You believe that Trump is god, then vote for Trump. You believe in hatred, racism, use of vullger language, vote for Trump. You believe in hatred, religious classifications, vote for Trump. You believe in wars, fighting and blood shed, vote for Trump. You believe in recklessness, vote for Trump. You believe in great plans that cannot be substantiated, then vote for Trump. You believe in rejection, mocking of fellow Americans, vote for Trump. If you are a clueless person, miss informed and has no inch of God given wisdom, vote for Trump. A vote for Trump has serious consequences. The whole world except Russia will reject America and Americans. America will be split right in the middle; moderates on the one side and radical deplorables on the other. Trump presidency will make America worst than Somalia. With Trump as President, America might experience the worst ever civil war in our generation. Only Jesus can win any war against Satan. Trump is The Anti Christ. Satan will prevail over America if Trump becomes your President. Trump does not even believe in God. He cannot even recite one single verse from the Holy Bible. America of all the countries in the Earth surface want to elect Lucifer's representative as President. Trump praises Putin, Lt Gaddafi, Lt Sadam Hussein. Trump will soon tell the world that Osama Bin Laden was his hero. If you vote Trump, America is headed to the worst ever direction, pit of hell. Use your vote, let God's wisdom prevail upon you. Allow God to direct your inner soul by the power of The Holy Spirit. The light in Trump is not God's light. It's Lucifer's light. Go out and vote Hillary Clinton The Queen. Go out and vote now. Trump deplorables are planning to bring chaos and turmoil in America on 8th of November. Go and vote now. Don't wait for Tuesday. Go and vote now. Vote Hillary Clinton. God bless America. The whole world is watching you. You can prevent this dangerous disaster of Trump becoming POTUS. You have the power. Go and vote for Hillary now. Go Hillary. Go Hillary. VOTE BLUE.
2 | Marlin Johnson | 0 | 1558462230840468_1558931747460183 | Anyone seriously considering voting for Hillary? What are Hillary’s accomplishments, besides becoming a 1%er as a corrupt public servant? How about her inability to properly handle classified documents? Why is the world in more political turmoil after her Secretary of State tenure? What about her well documented lies, e.g,. the Benghazi video, landing under sniper fire in Bosnia, Named after Sir Edmund Hillary, etc.? How about her vicious personal attacks on Bill’s sexual assault victims? The Clinton Foundation is under investigation by the FBI. Geez, this woman is the devil incarnate.

THIS ALL SOUNDS LIKE A DICTATOR TO ME, NOT A PRESIDENT AT ALL! SHE IS NOT ABOVE THE LAW! SHE IS GUILTY OF TREASON AND SHOULD HAVE HER SECURITY CLEARANCE REVOKED IMMEDIATELY AND ALSO HAVE HER HEAD EXAMINED BY A SHRINK! SHE IS TOTALLY LOONY BINS! IT"S REALLY SAD THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE IN THIS MADNESS! EVEN A SITTING PRESIDENT, FLYING IN THE PRESIDENTIAL JET, SPENDING MILLIONS OF OUR TAX PAYER DOLLARS TO CAMPAIGN FOR THIS EVIL WITCH! SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT WITH ALL OF THIS AT ALL! That is why I already VOTED in EARLY VOTING FOR DONALD J TRUMP, SO THIS EVIL CORRUPTION IS CONSUMED ONCE AND FOR ALL! TRUMP WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT WHO CLEANS THIS MESS UP AND THAT'S WHY THESE LIBERAL RADICAL DEMOCRATS ARE TOTALLY PANICKING AND SCARED AS HELL! TRUMP WILL BE THE WINNER IN A LANDSLIDE VOTE!

17 | Thad Cardine | 30 | 1558597777493580_1558635954156429 | 🇺🇸I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste from a fellow deplorable Trumpian🇺🇸

HRC laughing and hugging foul-mouth rappers and celebs is proof that she is somebody but Trump taking pictures with kids in the campaign trail is pandering. Stop it.
22 | Jerri Thomas | 17 | 1558597777493580_1558648144155210 | Just like I said if you want to see a change you better vote for Mr.Trump  or we all will be in trouble Hillary Clinton is another Obama think about your kids and grandkids

24 | Mario Arroyo | 9 | 1558597777493580_1090767014372734 | You know how you Trump supporters are always saying, “He tells it like it is”? Let me remind you of something. Racism is not new. Xenophobia (the dislike or suspicion of anyone not from your country) is not new, either. These things have been around for centuries. We all have them inside us, but we keep them under wraps. You know why? Because we are civilized! Civil-ized! We know not to walk around mouthing obscenities or insults or racial slurs…we know we have to live together on this one planet; there is nowhere else to go. In the past, when we let those racial insults enter into our daily interactions with other human beings, wars happened…people were killed or maimed; horrors of ferocious magnitudes were unleashed upon ourselves. So we learned to keep our mouths shut and be civilized toward each other. There is no other way! Those suspicions and disdain will always be with us; what keeps us as decent civilized people is we keep them under control. Under control! Donald Trump urges you to let those racial and xenophobic emotions loose, and you have forgotten why you kept them under control originally. He is not, “telling it like it is”; he is telling it like it isn’t! And like it should not be! We have come a long way toward being a civilized society; and the rest of the countries in the world all participate in the maintaining of a civilized society. Why would you even consider letting Donald Trump undo that? Don’t regress into the cave-man anarchy where everything is uncivilized. Get yourself under control…and vote blue.
25 | Linda Marrs-Patterson | 10 | 1558597777493580_1558655724154452 | Say what you want no one is going to change anyone's mind about who they have already chosen to vote for. No matter what he does or what she says it's already been determined in each persons mind who they are voting for. I am just thankful that this election is almost over.

1 | Dale Vossen | 279 | 1558597194160305_1558603154159709 | She needs big names to draw people in.. Only problem is just like the other day., right after the concert was over the big crowds left.. They didn't show up for her, just the show.. Even liberals don't want to hear her speeches.. Fact
2 | Jerry Lane | 183 | 1558597194160305_1558604654159559 | Beyoncé, Jay-z, Katie Perry, and Bon Jovi huh!! I wonder how much she had to pay them😂😂😂 They have sold their souls to the devil! Killary is desperate!
3 | Anthony Piluso | 53 | 1558597194160305_1558608530825838 | Were are the working people on the stage the taxpayer if this country. Why don't we have policeman, mail man, roofer, plumbers, construction workers, teachers, sanitation workers etc etc on the stage with her. But no you want the wash up singer bob jovi give me a f break
4 | Jim Connole | 74 | 1558597194160305_1558599504160074 | Hope Katy Perry does another witchcraft performance. The last one was great.Her and Hillary have something in common, a interest in aliens.
5 | Blakeney Adams | 54 | 1558597194160305_1558602737493084 | The desperation is getting old. The Democratic Party's had eight years to do something good and they've done nothing but frack it all up and screw the living frack out of Americans. I'm so happy I switched over and as soon as the election is over,  I'm going independent voter. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
6 | Ted Talevski | 28 | 1558597194160305_1558612760825415 | Why does Donald Trump not have any celebrities endorsing him? Because he does not need them when he has the backing of many middle-class American people! Celebrities like Beyonce, Jay-Z, LeBron James, Bon Jovi, and many others have a name worth millions, and under Obama/Hillary's policies they would not need to pay any of that to the government. Not for taxes, not for health care, not to have to take out a loan for anything! Under the promises of Trump that "the rich would pay their fair share of taxes" that would change for them. Of course you can only expect the rich elite would only go for the person that would not make anything change for them. They have it perfect with the system as is.
7 | Daniel Guard Patenaude Jr. | 36 | 1558597194160305_1558605517492806 | Because we should care what multi million dollar singers and celebrities have to say or vote for? Give me a break lol. They're life wont change. But the middle class working person? Definitely will.
8 | Brenda Brenza | 24 | 1558597194160305_1558628100823881 | From the barely dressed Jennifer Lopez, to the letting it all hang out with bedroom attachments Miley Cyrus and topless Katy Perry and Madonna, who even went so far as to offer oral sex to voters to Beyonce who is usually running around with half her rear hanging out, what this campaign says to my daughters is the way to win in life is to exploit women and their bodies for your own benefit. I am disgusted by the tactics used in this campaign and cannot believe for one minute this person is a champion of women. If she was, she would have encouraged these women to have more respect for themselves while attempting to share her "message". #nothanks
9 | Patrick Young | 25 | 1558597194160305_1558605514159473 | Can't take any more of MSNBS' foolishness and one-sided so-called reporting. They have yet to post one unbiased article on this election, the BLM and their domestic terrorist activities, the treason committed by this administration, and all the corruption that has taken place during and by Hillary's campaign. Anyone who buys into anything MSNBS puts out is totally brainwashed.

12 | Gina Gladden | 13 | 1558597194160305_1558619990824692 | I think she is Insulting voters' intelligence. Voters (young and old) don't need to be entertained. Informed voters vote based on the issues that they care about.  Obviously Hillary has a real problem motivating people to vote for her based upon her own merit. Her entertainer  campaign makes her look weak and desperate.
13 | Edward Ganley | 16 | 1558597194160305_1558606884159336 | Sweet, 2 people that sing good, but think not. Hillary just brings a show now to her rallies. She is so dishonest that Hillary can't just talk to her followers about her accomplishments. No Hillary can't, she has none. So her plan is to bring in a show, then give her speech just to scare her followers with lies, and scary rhetoric tactics. America can't have this dishonest person in the White House. EJG out. God Bless America.
14 | Jeremy Smith | 10 | 1558597194160305_1558655334154491 | Don't forget all of jay z profanity used last night with Hillary.Just think if Trump done this the liberal media would be ripping him a new one.But Hillary does it and she is a hero.Why can she not keep it professional like Trump and draw thousands of people like he does by his self without the help of rappers or other public figures. This should tell you somthing about Hillary and more reasons to vote Trump.

16 | Valerie Tomasevic | 6 | 1558597194160305_1558762164143808 | And since when do celebrities have any qualifications to talk about politics? Jay Z and Beyonce? Bon Jovi? Lol I didn't know that Jay Z's drug dealing experience qualifies him to be an expert in politics. LMAO! I understand the rapping, filled with profanities, gutter talk, talking down to women, talking about violence, drug use and on and on as he must be used to, but presidential matters? NO. But KILLARY likes that because rap suppresses people even more and keeps them in the ghetto where she wants them.

I was just wondering since Hillary didn't seem to mind when Jay-Z/Beyonce cursed up a storm and used the "N" word so a little nudity and crotch grabbing shouldn't bother her as long as she gets their money and votes.
19 | Patrick King | 8 | 1558597194160305_1558653590821332 | Now lets see were getting close to elction day and we still have people supporting Hillery so lets see what she would do her first day on the job first she will inform the justice dept to tell the FBI to hand over all records and evidence that they have for any investigation against the Clintons and there foundation next she will have them destroy so there will be no more ivestagations. so this will mean that she is now above the laws of the United States then she will make sure that judges are apointed that she controlls she all ready controlls most of the news networks and papers. then she will make everyone get rid of there guns that way only the crooks will have guns she has all ready down sized the military so much that our national guard has to fight wars because we dont have enough solders to do the job Police will have there hands tied and she will start giving favors to the dictators that have supported her and she will raise everyones taxs a lot she needs more money to donate to the clinton foundation as her nest egg she will srink the military to such a small size that we wont be even able to defend ourselfs Now all of you Clinton suporters just remember this you decision to elect Her will affect your kids and grand kids how will you tell them when they ask what happened to the United States will you tell them you elected a person that should have been tried for treason and you helped her distroy this country by voteing for her will you tell your kids that you didnt care about this country and you must want a trator to lead you she will be the first dictator
20 | Debbie Clouse Zachary-Barnett | 7 | 1558597194160305_1558608420825849 | Chelsea Clinton's in-laws:.......... Get this out soon, He is Edward “Ed” Mezvinsky, born January 17, 1937. Then you’ll probably say, “Who is Ed Mezvinsky?”Well, he is a former Democrat congressman who represented Iowa ’s 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives for two terms, from 1973 to 1977.He sat on the House Judiciary Committee that decided the fate of Richard Nixon.He was outspoken saying that Nixon was a crook and a disgrace to politics and the nation and should be impeached.He and the Clintons were friends and very politicallyintertwined for many years.Ed Mezvinsky had an affair with NBC News reporter Marjorie Sue Margolies and later married her after his wife divorced him.In 1993, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, then a freshman Democrat in Congress, cast the deciding vote that got President Bill Clinton’s controversial tax package through the House of Representatives.In March 2001, Mezvinsky was indicted and later pleaded guilty to 31 of 69 counts of bank fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud.Ed Mezvinsky embezzled more than $10 million dollars from people via both a Ponzi scheme and the notorious Nigerian e-mail scams.He was found guilty and sentenced to 80 months in federal prison.After serving less than five years in federal prison, he was released in April 2008 and remains on federal probation.To this day, he still owes $9.4 million in restitution to his victims.About now you are saying, “So what!”Well, this is Marc and Chelsea Mezvinsky:That’s right; Ed Mezvinsky is Chelsea Clinton’s father-in-law.Now Marc and Chelsea are in their early thirties and purchased a 10.5 million dollar NYC apartment Has anyone heard mention of any of this in any of the media?If this guy was Jenna or Barbara Bush’s, or better yet, Sarah Palin’s daughter’s father-in- law, the news would be an everyday headline and every detail would be reported over and over.Yet they say there are no double standards in political reporting.People are already talking about Hillarious as our next President!And then there is possibly Chelsea for President in our future!The cycle never ends!Lying and corruption seem to make Democrat candidates more popular.

22 | Keenan Reese | 1 | 1558597194160305_1558773534142671 | Hillary's just s bad as Obama in their support of locking up people for victimless crime, ( the majority poor minorities ), costing Americans billions, and wasting millions of police hours, which could have been used solving real crime. Trump is saying he will legalize marijuana in all fifty states. Now that would be a legacy to be proud of.
23 | Krysta Marberry | 3 | 1558597194160305_1558693130817378 | Bon Jovi just released their new album. Them performing for Hillary Clinton could have serious consequences for them such as low album sales in stores and on Itunes.

His own party hates him, look at Kasich, Romney, Mccain...You'd all be speaking differently if he did have this support. The majority of the world hates him.
25 | Bill Simmens | 0 | 1558597194160305_1777309949208857 | Four preventable American deaths in Benghazi, failed policies in Libya, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia, rise of ISIS (how many deaths has ISIS committed), illegal server, unsecured classified and top secret State Department emails, subpoenaed emails destruction, Clinton Foundation connections, scandals, investigations. You call this qualified? Clinton cannot follow basic laws. A lifetime of controversy. Distorted so called Trump's issues are petty compared to Clinton's actions. Clinton has become a multi millionaire through unethical, shady, and maybe illegal means.Trump has become a multi billionaire through ethical and legal means. (any significant wrong doing or finding against Trump would be front page news 24/7. Most of the minor accusations of wrong doing are false, spun or made up, or settled. Anti Trump people are desperate for dirt). Trump, a Global Business Leader (whether you have an appreciation for what that is or not) has a history of mostly success. Clinton, a career politician has a history of mostly failure. I look at accomplishments and performance, not rhetoric. Business leaders compete daily. Politicians compete at election time. Seek truth. The self serving government cartel needs to end. Our country is desperate for a real leader that will serve the people.

Im not a black lives matter, I'm a all lives matter cause this does happen to all Americans of every race In This case they signaled out the Black Community & it's not right.

It seems to be a word thrown around all the time these days when someone sees or here's something they don't like but this is seriously messed up. I find it hard to believe this guy wasn't involved in the actual beatings, but even if you choose to believe he wasn't you honestly cannot believe he wasn't aware of it which would make him just as liable as the other officers. However saying that I totally think he is guilty of everything he was accused of doing and what idiots really believe that a handcuffed man in the backseat of a cop car shot themselves

17 | Dan Miller | 0 | 1558569190829772_1558931034126921 | so it's OK for rappers like Jay Z to call out the N-word at his performances and it's OK for comedians to use the N-word's as long as they're black even sports athletes can use the N-word with each other but it's not OK for any other person of any other race to use the N-word regardless of what position they hold?this is why the black community does not have a lot of sympathy among nonblacks when there is a double standard such as this. The non-black community expects all blacks to support one standard and not use the N-word at all and call out other blacks were doing so

It is almost impossible to do anything otherwise to them during their term. Want to get this muthafucka out, remind the country he is working for when he is up for re-election how he feels about our black brother.

We cannot allow Obama's presidency to be de legitimized by the alt right who will be emboldened by a Trump win. We cannot let this epic misogynist be the example for our children.
15 | Peter Geedman | 0 | 1558501484169876_1558716880815003 | How quickly we forget! If you’re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane—you won’t believe what you have forgotten. If you’re under 35, read on—I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn’t a joke.  I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"By Bill Snow Jr.

17 | Robert Hansen | 0 | 1558501484169876_1558977170788974 | Woe to the nation that succumbs to cynicism. It is a poison that suffocates hope, extinguishes the light of intelligence, and severs the common bonds of humanity. I fear we are facing an epidemic of cynicism in the United States and it is an infection that could send our democracy onto life support. When I came to Washington as a young reporter to cover the Johnson Administration, I entered a small White House press corps that was almost exclusively made up of men. The most influential, the leaders, were old men.  Some of them often reeked of whisky, cigarettes... and cynicism.I respected the fact that they were survivors of long wars in the journalistic trenches, and they were--in the main--good reporters who could write well, quickly, and under deadline pressure. But I was a bit aghast at their deep, abiding cynicism and I remember going home to my greatest font of wisdom, my beloved wife, Jean, and in the earnestness of a young couple eager to sow the seeds of long-term success, I told her I don't every want to become like that. Webster's defines "cynical" as: "believing that people are generally selfish and dishonest." All the fiber of my being, all my life experience up to point, led me to the opposite conclusion. Sure some people were bad, but not most, and certainly not categorically all - even in Washington, let alone the many millions spread across the vast continental expanse of our great nation. I remembering desperately thumbing through a thesaurus searching over a list of synonyms for "cynical" to come up with something more akin to what I felt my profession as a journalist should demand. After a while, I came to the word "skeptical" and it struck me. Webster's defines "skeptical" as "having or expressing doubt about something (such as a claim or statement)." That seemed to be the job of a reporter, saying "I hear what you have to say but I am going to check it out." I was happy to march under the banner of skepticism, and I have ever since. Many young colleagues of mine have heard - more than they can probably count - some version of my professional credo: "A reporter's job is to be skeptical but not cynical." And it turns out this approach to life doesn't just benefit journalists. I have heard some version of it from scientists, police detectives, military generals, judges, and so many others. Cynicism is a downward spiral. Skepticism is a healthy way to find truth in a complex world. And yet today, we, as a nation, are in danger of losing the battle to cynicism. We have a broken government because some have decided to play to cynicism for their own political gain. We have a press corps that has too often confused cynical slogans with prescient analysis. We have had the motives of experts from science and industry challenged with cynicism by those who do not like the conclusions based on fact. The great wit Oscar Wilde once said: "“A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything, and the value of nothing.” Stephen Colbert addressed the notion with a fuller definition in a commencement address at Knox College: " Cynicism masquerades as wisdom, but it is the farthest thing from it. Because cynics don't learn anything. Because cynicism is a self-imposed blindness, a rejection of the world because we are afraid it will hurt us or disappoint us. Cynics always say no. But saying "yes" begins things. Saying "yes" is how things grow. Saying "yes" leads to knowledge."I know which world I would rather live in and I hope a less cynical world can await us after November 8.Dan Rather..........

If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your Facebook status if you support and will vote Donald J. Trump for President

You call this qualified? Clinton cannot follow basic laws. A lifetime of controversy. Distorted so called Trump's issues are petty compared to Clinton's actions. Clinton has become a multi millionaire through unethical, shady, and maybe illegal means.Trump has become a multi billionaire through ethical and legal means. (any significant wrong doing or finding against Trump would be front page news 24/7. Most of the minor accusations of wrong doing are false, spun or made up, or settled. Anti Trump people are desperate for dirt). Trump, a Global Business Leader (whether you have an appreciation for what that is or not) has a history of mostly success. Clinton, a career politician has a history of mostly failure. I look at accomplishments and performance, not rhetoric. Business leaders compete daily. Politicians compete at election time. Seek truth. The self serving government cartel needs to end. Our country is desperate for a real leader that will serve the people.

This is sensationalism by the attorney to get this person off of the sentence that has already been passed. Doing anything they can to get media attention to get the sympathy card into play.

She should not have leaked those details(.)   -Everyone is all cool with that idea because of the current politics but as a nation, we should never be ok with individuals leaking anything to anyone. Really when the material leaked potentially impacted others.On the other hand, to keep a person who is mentally unstable in the same condition that's contributing to the conditions doesn't seem America great either.
9 | Jessie Fay | 17 | 1558460564173968_1558624537490904 | Well if HE wants an expensive operation to mutilate his body so he can play the role of female in spite of his internal anatomy and chromosomes which cannot be changed then he needs to find a way to raise the money for the treatment himself since taxpayers don't owe him that and shouldn't be coerced out of their tax money just so it can be squandered on crap like this! Many LAW ABIDING people are being screwed out of actual life essential medical care like chemo or organ transplants and laws are not being written that force tax payers to cover those much more needed procedures for those much more deserving people and until the funds are there for that much more noble cause than this guy should just have to such it up!!!

And, on top of that, transgender people are far more inclined toward suicide due to their mental problems that lead them to the gender confusion.

13 | Ben Thigpen | 5 | 1558460564173968_1558667994153225 | He was arrested for treason and he wants to mutilate his body. Now you people want to give him hormones. Then you can't figure out why he has mental problems? Really.  He needs psychiatric medication not hormones. Putting on a dress and cutting off your genitals doesn't make you a woman. It makes you a guy in a dress with no genitals. For all the men out there that are saying this is a woman you need to join him and have yours removed too. You obviously don't need them!  Get this poor man some psychiatric help and quit encouraging his behavior before he kills himself.

1 | Jerry Pease | 22 | 1558410737512284_1558507127502645 | Smoking some weed should not be a crime.   Smuggling hundreds of thousands pounds of pot for a foreign drug lord?  He wasn't doing a anything good except to make himself rich.  He would of just as easily smuggled in cocaine or heroin.  Let him stay in jail.

You believe in harmony, peace and better security in your neighborhood. Then vote for Hillary Clinton. You believe that together, we are one, our political diversity is our strength. Vote for Hillary Clinton. You believe in forgiveness of sins. You believe that America is the greatest country in the planet Earth. Then vote for Hillary Clinton. You believe that everyone in this country can work harder to make America even better. You believe that Americans and American President must be accepted by the all countries in the Face of The Planet. Then vote for Hillary Clinton. But if you believe that one person can finish America problems, vote for Trump. You believe that Trump is god, then vote for Trump. You believe in hatred, racism, use of vullger language, vote for Trump. You believe in hatred, religious classifications, vote for Trump. You believe in wars, fighting and blood shed, vote for Trump. You believe in recklessness, vote for Trump. You believe in great plans that cannot be substantiated, then vote for Trump. You believe in rejection, mocking of fellow Americans, vote for Trump. If you are a clueless person, miss informed and has no inch of God given wisdom, vote for Trump. A vote for Trump has serious consequences. The whole world except Russia will reject America and Americans. America will be split right in the middle; moderates on the one side and radical deplorables on the other. Trump presidency will make America worst than Somalia. With Trump as President, America might experience the worst ever civil war in our generation. Only Jesus can win any war against Satan. Trump is The Anti Christ. Satan will prevail over America if Trump becomes your President. Trump does not even believe in God. He cannot even recite one single verse from the Holy Bible. America of all the countries in the Earth surface want to elect Lucifer's representative as President. Trump praises Putin, Lt Gaddafi, Lt Sadam Hussein. Trump will soon tell the world that Osama Bin Laden was his hero. If you vote Trump, America is headed to the worst ever direction, pit of hell. Use your vote, let God's wisdom prevail upon you. Allow God to direct your inner soul by the power of The Holy Spirit. The light in Trump is not God's light. It's Lucifer's light. Go out and vote Hillary Clinton The Queen. Go out and vote now. Trump deplorables are planning to bring chaos and turmoil in America on 8th of November. Go and vote now. Don't wait for Tuesday. Go and vote now. Vote Hillary Clinton. God bless America. The whole world is watching you. You can prevent this dangerous disaster of Trump becoming POTUS. You have the power. Go and vote for Hillary now. Go Hillary. Go Hillary. VOTE BLUE.

I am disgusted by the tactics used in this campaign and cannot believe for one minute this person is a champion of women.

6 | Michael Shippole | 85 | 1558361177517240_1558369327516425 | Sad really, so much death surrounds the  democrat party. Whether its mass public attacks like the Boston Marathon bombing, the Orlando or san Bernardino massacres, or school shootings like sandy hook, or homicde epidemics like in Chicago, or race related ones like the Dallas police assassinations and the Roof assassinations. Of course that's just the domestic loss of lives. The failed foreign policies in places like Syria have led to unprecedented loss of life. Sad really, but the democrats will send the wrong message and celebrate. It's important to remember how this kind of violent society could have developed in the 21st century. The answer is politics. When individuals in politics try to control society from the top down it becomes corrupt. No longer are the people's voices being heard, instead their voices are silenced by a system that is no longer of the people, by the people, for the people.

The language Trump is demonized for is front and center in these stars' lyrics that play over and over again on radio, TV, Pandora, infiltrating our kids' minds. I find Trump's language offensive, there's no way to defend it, but to have the Clinton campaign showcase people whose language and influence is even worse reveals so much. It should disturb us all.
19 | Elaine Marie | 11 | 1558361177517240_1558386754181349 | The woman who falsely accused Donald Trump of raping her two decades ago has again dropped a federal lawsuit over the alleged assaults.The accuser's lead attorney, Thomas Meagher of New Jersey, filed to dismiss the case Friday evening in federal court in Manhattan.
20 | Sara Em | 7 | 1558361177517240_1558402974179727 | Beyoncé and Jay-Z are tax paying citizens (unlike trump) who have a voice and are allowed to vote just like rest of us. Hillary has several famous people who support her. You trumpies are just angry because no one wants to be anywhere near the orange groper.
21 | Monica Es | 5 | 1558361177517240_1597755353865905 | Heres a little background on this thug....Jay-Z was a crack dealer in Brooklyn at the age of 13. During an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2009, he called drug dealers in Brooklyn his “role models” growing up.He also has a history of violence. When he was 12, he shot his 16-year-old brother and he stabbed a record producer in December 1999. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation for the assault. Jay was even shot three times while growing up. There's your role model.
22 | KeithandBecky Breaux | 4 | 1558361177517240_923050737839227 | This concert was an embarrassment to the American people. It was full of foul offensive language and gestures. Hillary keeps saying she goes high.... but the Democrats are getting shovels for their candidate this morning. This Democrat is voting Republican and changing parties after this election.
23 | Bobby Dubre | 11 | 1558361177517240_1558396637513694 | What I find offensive is that Trump and Fox news can say flat out LIES in their ads, and not be held accountable. If Trump gets elected I should file a civil suit against them for election tampering. Trump is complete trash.
24 | Stacey Reichart Keys | 5 | 1558361177517240_1597731193868321 | You will report this bs but won't report Trump bring on stage a mother and father who lost their son of only 19 that supports Trump. He gave this mother 20mins to talk with the crowd, she's not a entertainer nor a star. Trump has a heart for everyone!!
25 | Jordenn Morrow | 4 | 1558361177517240_1558409667512391 | People big mad about this yes she got celebrity are y'all mad??? If Trump did the same thing y'all wouldn't be saying anything so go ahead Hillary you better get JayZ and Queen B

NBC News senior political editor Mark Murray tells TODAY that Donald J. Trump needs to “win all the toss-ups and then pick off someplace where Hillary Clinton is strong and leading in the polls.”

1 | Angela Semeta | 381 | 1558306934189331_1558308360855855 | He might as well pack up his bags and go home now..bye bye Mr. Trump..Hello President Clinton!!
2 | Jennifer Hajdics | 284 | 1558306934189331_1558309257522432 | Imagine this:In the White House Situation Room, a huge covert military op is is progress. Lives of our servicemen are at stake, timing is critical. The military official asks President Trump what his order is......and he can't answer until someone explains what's happening because he was elected having ZERO experience and ZERO qualifications to do the job. And people end up dead. Trump is unfit in every way to lead this country. You hate Hillary Clinton? Fine. Hate her, but don't be blind to the fact that she's the only candidate who DOES have the experience and qualifications to lead this country.
3 | Dave Peet | 157 | 1558306934189331_1558308070855884 | Notice he is only going to Tampa? Polk, Pasco,Hillsboro, and Pinellas counties are his strongest support in FL. Miami, Orlando, The Keys, and most of Northern Florida will vote for Hillary. Trump can't win Florida with just Tampa Bay Area alone.
4 | Heather Rutledge | 78 | 1558306934189331_1558312624188762 | Again NBC who are you/they polling? The Giant Center in Hershey filled to compacity for Trump yet Clinton can't even fill a high school gym in the Harrisburg area???
5 | Cheryl-Anne Simoneau | 83 | 1558306934189331_1558335124186512 | "If we elect a bonafide sociopath who's a self-admitted sexual predator, a bully and a puppet for Russia because of how Hillary Clinton dealt with emails over four years ago...We're the dumbest nation on Earth." - Allen Clifton
6 | James Laubhan | 68 | 1558306934189331_1558321524187872 | Clinton starts with the blue wall 243, everyone knows that. She can afford to lose Florida but she may take it anyway. Her path to 270 has many options, Trump needs a lot, and a clean sweep of the swing states. Not impossible but Obama/Romney was closer at this point in 2012. Just be sure to vote and we should be fine for Hillary
7 | Sky Zig | 42 | 1558306934189331_1558325197520838 | Complete BS, Lies by the media. All polls rigged by 10% to favor Hillary... FBI wants to lock her up, but corrupt Obama won't let them! Only Donald J. Trump can save us
8 | Manny Ortega-Prieto | 14 | 1558306934189331_1558363167517041 | Clinton will not take Florida, we won't give her the electro vote that she needs, for example my family is divided in democrat and Republican but most of the Democrat are voting for Trump and the rest are not voting, in Miami Dade county you can't see a bumper sticker on the car for Clinton but in 2008 and 2012 it was all over the place , that mean she has a big problem in Florida
9 | Travis C DeFalco | 26 | 1558306934189331_1558313237522034 | It's funny how one media outlet says states are turning red and another say they are turning blue. The media has no clue. In couple days the will find out what the people want not the media.
10 | James D. Chua | 24 | 1558306934189331_1558329330853758 | Trump's most humiliating defeat will come from the state who knows him best- his home state of new york. Hillary- 71%, trump- 20%. Only those who dont know him will vote for him.
11 | Guy Snider | 12 | 1558306934189331_1558437920842899 | To all of the Trumpers out there. Be prepared to be a living example for the rest of your life to be on the wrong side of history. I've seen it first hand when you're families kids study this election in school you'll be the one everyone in the family says "uncle Scott really voted that Guy over our first woman President?" What a pathetic legacy. Desperately clinging to the past and tired disproven ideals.
12 | Rocky Borreson | 12 | 1558306934189331_1558317664188258 | Don't know about that, but here in Vegas they kept the polling place open all night for the big influx of Latino voters. And in Florida they have 150,000 new Latino voters joining the rolls..I'd say that's good news.
13 | George Arvanitis | 5 | 1558306934189331_1558444354175589 | Florida will be easy for hillary with all the hispanic vote along with the african/american vote, the 70 percent rednecks in tampa area will help trump but the 30 percent there will vote clinton.
14 | Todd Cowart | 8 | 1558306934189331_1558318920854799 | This is a thought for those GOPers. Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016
15 | Joseph Fedorko | 11 | 1558306934189331_1558336994186325 | He won't. Early and Hispanic voting will clinch FL, NC, and maybe even AZ (unlike Drumpf, Hillary has data and resources and knows what she's doing) and GA (the Carters are going to campaign this weekend for Hillary), and PA/MI will stay Democratic. OH may wind up closer than we think. The Comey smear effects are wearing off and don't be surprised if his stupid crazy random travel schedule combines with the Melania/National Enquirer/who knows what else oppo bombs cause one final meltdown on the stump or on Twitter ...
16 | David Kenneth | 15 | 1558306934189331_1558320434187981 | He's avoiding the major cities in most of his cult tour. Here in Colorado he hardly has even been near Denver and hits the crazy places like Colorado Springs and Greeley. Not a great path for him.
17 | Don Kephart | 6 | 1558306934189331_1558330857520272 | If Trump wins all the states he is leading in according to neutral Real Clear Politics and Florida. Trump hits 270. NBC has Ohio as Toss up. Ridiculous Trump has consistently led there.
18 | Steve Chmielorz Sr. | 2 | 1558306934189331_1558360357517322 | It probably is just the opposite if rallies are any indication of who is leading in the poles. Trump has thousands of people attending, while Clinton has had to cancel some for lack of attendance.
19 | David C. Nasworthy | 3 | 1558306934189331_1558465724173452 | Don't know where these guys got their training but there's landslides going on in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and especially Florida.
20 | Eddie Cox | 3 | 1558306934189331_1558474364172588 | I call B.S , Hillary's turn out is low and she has George Soro's election booths. If she wins it's because she cheated with dead voters. How can she get away with all of her corruption
21 | Bill Teichgraber | 2 | 1558306934189331_1161321870647855 | What does the DNC, BHO, MO, JP, HA, WJC and HRC know about lying and misleading voters? It's an everyday method of operation in their playbook. No role models or examples of integrity to be found. When all the facts and truth finally surface, people will either be elated, devastated, relieved, enraged, or engaged in various forms of denial. The truth will be a tidal wave felt around the world.
22 | Michael LaPlante | 1 | 1558306934189331_1763142470619913 | Let's just put it this way: If Hillary wins Florida  she most assuredly would win the election; whereas if Trump doesn't win Florida he would most assuredly lose the election. That's how important a win in Florida would mean to each candidate. That's why there has been such a surge of campaigning going on in the waning days of this 2016 election season; Where both Repubs and Dems are sending in their heavy hitters to different parts of the state to garner more votes. Obama is slated to speak in Kissimmee Sunday with Stevie Wonder. It's still a close call here where we have a heavy latino vote and lots of military and retirees. A record number voters have participated in early voting. And may I remind you polls stay open one hour later in the western part of the state because Florida has two time zones.
23 | Jeanne Brooks-Miller | 2 | 1558306934189331_1161411620638880 | Jennifer Hajdics...yep Hillary had experience with allowing Americans to die, lying under oath, stealing from The Peoples House, both hiding and destroying evidence in 5 federal investigations & breaking house rules while serving on Watergate committee. Yep she is experienced. And unlike her opponet Hillary has called millions of Americans derogatory names or made derogatory statements...she has hit just about everyone...blacks, latinos, gypsies, muslim, catholics, christians, Martin Luther King and Ghandi...yep what experience she has...
24 | Debbie Reed Ramey | 2 | 1558306934189331_1558424967510861 | In a couple days you will get to see what the voters want, not what the media wants, or the polls say. I hope this election makes a laughing stock out of some news outlets & analysts. It happened in the primary & it will happen again.
25 | Belinda Gibson | 3 | 1558306934189331_1558355544184470 | You guys are a joke..,I watch live rally videos.... YouTube....in my personal life... comments on the major news networks on social media and there is NO WAY Hillary is ahead or going to win...No way,!! Except for cheating.

1 | Donna Clark Wood | 122 | 1558271857526172_1558277770858914 | What the heck...... Get out of here I think that 95% of woman that voted for Hillary is only because they want that first woman President. It doesn't matter to them about all the things that she has done and does
2 | James Martin | 88 | 1558271857526172_1558280557525302 | Hi ladies  my mom is a lifelong democrat an her an i have been talking about this an she's 68 years old an would love to vote for the first lady president but in this election she's passing on Mrs Clinton just to much baggage to overcome for her with Mrs Clinton,she said she wish Mrs Obama was running she be a shoe in  an my mom may be right there ,so after ALOT of thinking an talking she going to vote for Mr TRUMP she knows that this nation needs change right now so we ask that you all truly take the time an consider Mr TRUMP real change GOD bless you and the USA
3 | Dina Kirkconnell | 53 | 1558271857526172_1558279550858736 | Don't be naive! Why is her campaign not being run by a woman? Donald's is!!!!! Enough said! Actions speaks louder than words!
4 | Liberty Never Sleeps | 19 | 1558271857526172_1558279907525367 | What about Christians? Or the Irish? Or Blacks? Or any ethnic group for that matter. Do we based hiring on these factor or on the requirements of the job and who is best suited to do them. I'm tired of these politics of division in which no one wins. I want someone who is running for President to talk about all of America as equals; about all Americans instead of this special interest group or that one. What is good for Irishman is good for the African American folks. Clinton is always talking about a dark, depressing, vision for America that Trump has. What about her own, where women and minorities are too dumb, weak and lazy to do things on their own and without government intervention?That's not the America I know.
5 | Kishor Drone | 14 | 1558271857526172_1558328280853863 | The woman already lived in the White House for 8 yes eight years. America , like I phones, computers and technology thrives on change. And for change it has to be Donald Trump. He is not as stupid as he is made to look like, by the democrats. Wake up America.
6 | Janine Lea | 14 | 1558271857526172_1558322460854445 | Voting for a woman ONLY because she's a woman is as stupid as voting for black man BECAUSE he is black turned out to be.Vote for the PERSON. Not the race/gender/nationality. Trump/2016.
7 | Susan L Whitesall | 6 | 1558271857526172_1558374230849268 | I grew up in this country with men leading the country and major businesses, has anyone thought for one moment "and look where we are now?" What have they done with all that power and money? All these years? I am for the most part a traditional woman, I have watched many wrong decisions made by many men, and have voted both parties, but I'm not voting for Clinton because she's a woman, I'm voting for her because I know she has the ability to do a much better job than trump, America is not a business, and while he's made money, he's also lost and failed at even that. He can't seem to keep a marriage together, or formulate an intellegent thought without a promptor or someone writing it down for him. Without his money and businesses, what does he have that qualifies him? He's an authoritarian dictator type in business, what kind of president is that? Go ask those who have leadership like that around the world, it's not pretty. And those are the leaders he actually admires!! VOTE BLUE ALL THE WAY, SHUT HIM AND HIS KIND DOWN! FOR GOOD!
8 | Thomas Dalgaard | 7 | 1558271857526172_1558295124190512 | France has more of age men working or looking for a job than the US does...can you imagine what means? How many men are completely out of the workforce in the US....No wonder 'the unemployment rate' is only at 4.9%. Should Obama and Hillary be proud of this???
9 | Karen Sargent | 10 | 1558271857526172_1558322760854415 | Everyone vouching for the WOMAN should go to jail with her, vote policies, not gender. Notice she has to get people to speak for her, because she can't speak for herself. Embarrassing.
10 | Barbara Nelson | 2 | 1558271857526172_1558773494142675 | I dont want my granddaughter growing up thinking the only way a woman can get anywhere is by lying, riding a mans coattails, or belittling other women. Wheres the interviews of the massive amount of women employed by Trumps companies? Nope only ex employees with a grudge. Wheres the numbers of women employed by Clinton oh ya her daughter works for their foundation and her advisors are paid by our taxes.  How many women have always had employer paid health care before Obama care. (Think that was 78 % but they didnt report that just that Trump didnt have the exact number) How many Clintons are stuck on Obama Care. None the get free government healthcare( my taxes pay for that also). I want my granddaughter ti know you can be anything accomplish anything with honesty integrity and hard work (something the media forgotten to practice). To stand by her beliefs not matter the cost because self respect is the most important thing she will ever have. And if a person can stand in front of you and bold face lie that is not a role model, anyone who uses mistakes as a way of life is not a role model, a person that uses women and the issue of sexual assault lightly and for political gain is NOT a role model. A person who drags people of different ethnic backgrounds and pays them to show up for political gain is not a role model. I hope my granddaughter has a chance to see a woman President she can be proud of, not ashamed of as a woman. I hope my granddaughter gets to live in a world not ruled by hate, lies, and truth. Thank god shes to young to see and understand this election and all the negative media circus crap we have had to endure.
11 | Monica Es | 2 | 1558271857526172_1558912610795430 | Voting for Hillary Clinton because she is a woman is not a step forward, but a step backward. We are slowly but surely working our way toward the world that Steinem and Albright imagined when they struggled for gender equality. Hillary Clinton is married to a sexual predator rapist, she is certainly not a champion for women.
12 | Ann Kimoto | 0 | 1558271857526172_1558511310835560 | Personally, I'd like to see more women in the Senate and house. Women are more flexible than many men. Especially the older men, need to be in charge, fragile egos, single minded, etc. The younger men I think are more flexible, easier to reason with. Cheers, guys.

15 | Richard Pennick | 1 | 1558271857526172_1558444780842213 | i see a lot of wrong in all this ..we as a peoples should want the best and the brightest running things ..not people just because they are a certain sex or what ever ..its not a race ..especially when you have dishonest people in their as such as it is now ...most of those women pictured i wouldnt trust any further than i could see them ...
16 | Giselle Szpicek | 1 | 1558271857526172_1558487030837988 | About time, we can't make it any worse. I'm not voting for Hillary because she's a woman. I'm voting for her because Trump is an idiot. Neither one appeals to me, truly. What is really disappointing about this election is how nasty and hateful people are being. Shameful.
17 | Thomas Rollins | 0 | 1558271857526172_1558362360850455 | U don't think that the gender of a politician is important at all.  I think what is important is what and how they plan to do. Far too often these reports are made to say there is a sexism problem,  but then there aren't any transgender politicians that I'm aware of.  Is it because people don't like them,  or more likely that they aren't running?
18 | Vicente Izaguirre | 1 | 1558271857526172_1558331424186882 | Para los que se olvidaron de como nos dejaron los republicanos hace 8 años..y esto que soy republicano pero no ciego ni fanático, porque yo voto por la persona y su plan de gobierno, no voto por votar .Cuando el presidente Obama tomó la presidencia la bolsa de valores estaba por el suelo, los republicanos nos dejaron una recesión , el desempleo estaba al máximo,los precios de las gasolinas por las nubes, nuestros soldados estaban muriendo en las guerras del medio oriente, la gente no tenía trabajo, las familias estaban perdiendo sus casas, apartamentos, etc.. las empresas estaban cerrando por todos lados, las empresas automotrices casi cerraban por falta de dinero , etc,etc.. era un desastre..pero llego el presidente Obama y poco a poco fue arreglando las cosas ...despues de 8 años, tenemos una recuperación económica, el desempleo esta bajísimo como al 4.9; el precio de la gasolina es el mas bajo, 2.59 por galón; en Miami hay construcciones por doquier, se ofrecen ofertas de trabajos por todos lados; no estamos en guerras,etc. A los radicales les encanta criticar al presidente Obama pero si olvidan del pasado que nos dejaron los republicanos..y ven a trump como un angelito blanco que se ha declarado 6 veces en bancarrota, dejado a miles sin dinero y sin trabajos, es un hombre prepotente, arrogante, mentiroso, peligroso, discriminados, abusador ,hablador, y sin ningún plan especifico de gobierno.. solo se ha dedicado a difamar y criticar a la sra. Clinton..ha sembrado el odio y división entre todos..no hay que ser ciegos ni mucho menos fanáticos, hay que ser realistas y conscientes que el presidente Obama lo que cogió fué una papa caliente que le dejaron los Reblubicanos y que no lo han dejado trabajar...lo han bloqueado por todos lados para hacerlo lucir mal ... y muchos dicen que es por su color y ahora los machistas no quieren que una mujer llegue al poder.. veremos que quiere la mayoría del pueblo norteamericano..

Because you support a Lying , Corrupt , Criminal , which makes your values the same as hers !
20 | Jacalyn Engler | 2 | 1558271857526172_1558278087525549 | Maybe someday death threats and bomb threats against women (sending them back into hiding), who are accusing a rich powerful pervert of #childrapetrump will not be considered a victory for the defendent! and what happened to kids presumed murdered will matter, even if they were a immigrant wanna be model lured into working sex parties. #whereisMaria I wonder if @MelaniaTrump is celebrating with her hubby that his RAPE case was withdrawn due to intense BULLYING!
21 | Ginger Spelts | 6 | 1558271857526172_1558282757525082 | Decades of corruption. Haven't you had enough of it yet? Remember when 70% did not want Obamacare, but they shoved it down our throats. They said we could not even read the bill until they passed it. So much corruption for decades now. Haven't you had enough of it yet? We sat and watched someone commit crimes, lie to congress, lie to the American people, but they are not charged with a crime, because the same laws that apply to you and me, do not apply to them. So much corruption. Haven't you had enough of it yet? I sure have! Vote Trump on Nov. 8th and lets make America great again!
22 | Harold L Spears Jr. | 1 | 1558271857526172_1558942254125799 | Hillary has been a disgrace to women and has only set them back. This country will long remember their first woman candidate. Hillary is destroying the progress women have made.
23 | Judith Mike Cook | 5 | 1558271857526172_1558317804188244 | Hillary is funded by Big Money, Big Corporations, and foreign governments...she sold State Dept favors for contributions to the Clinton Foundation. She has a history of 30 years of lying and corruption, she has been under investigation dozens of times...she will sell out Americans and America in the blink of an eye and never lose a night's sleep...just like Benghazi!!
24 | Willis M Parker | 1 | 1558271857526172_1558374244182600 | And your point is? we should elect women no matter what the qualifications? Well that may happen, God forbid, if the liar, criminal murdering Hillary were to become president.
25 | Jesse Dinoia | 2 | 1558271857526172_1558285974191427 | Since what we study in college is an elective and not mandatory I would think the answer would lie in how many women vs men studied for major degrees in economics and politics.

2 | Louis Danny Mercadante | 164 | 1558255610861130_1558257807527577 | Hey NBC how about telling everyone that the women that accused Trump of groping were paid 500K a piece and the woman who accuse trump of rape when she was 13 dropped the case
3 | Amadu Barry | 51 | 1558255610861130_1558272134192811 | President Clinton will be working for the American people to make their lives better. Donald will be in jail for rapping a minor and tweeting insults at anyone or everyone for not voting for him.
4 | Jennifer Hajdics | 62 | 1558255610861130_1558258620860829 | Imagine this:In the White House Situation Room, a huge covert military op is is progress. Lives of our servicemen are at stake, timing is critical. The military official asks President Trump what his order is......and he can't answer until someone explains what's happening because he was elected having ZERO experience and ZERO qualifications to do the job. And people end up dead. Trump is unfit in every way to lead this country. You hate Hillary Clinton? Fine. Hate her, but don't be blind to the fact that she's the only candidate who DOES have the experience and qualifications to lead this country.
5 | Jessé Middleton | 39 | 1558255610861130_1558258140860877 | The US Constitution says that a Presidential candidate to be qualified should be at least 35 years of age, a natural-born citizen and have should have lived in the US for 14 years... I meet zero of those criteria above and yet I still feel that I am more qualified to lead the entire country than any of those in the ballot.

7 | Gordon Taylor | 29 | 1558255610861130_1558266950859996 | Putting Hillary Clinton in the oval office based on her experience is like a national bank saying we've hired this man, Jesse James, to be president of our bank because he has a lot of experience with banks.
8 | Shawn Gustafson Schwerman | 11 | 1558255610861130_1558318810854810 | Let's pretend that you've never heard a word that they've said nor seen them. Let's just look at some other things. Five living presidents who've done the job (both parties) endorse one.  World leaders from around the world denounce the other. The KKK supports that same person. Which person would you choose?  Why do you think the KKK and Russia are so involved and in love with one guy?  Doesn't it make you wonder?  Why do the five living presidents and world leaders support her?  Doesn't the corruption allegations scare them?  Why not?  Could they be baseless?  Once you've answered those questions for yourself and still vote for him you are in alignment with the KKK and Russia's dictator. Think about that.

10 | Charlize-ann Gonzalez | 16 | 1558255610861130_1558303520856339 | Let's say Trump is a misogynistic, xenophobic, racist,that has cheated on his wives multiple times...I just can't bring myself to vote for that orange turd it's not in my DNA to do that! The words that are coming out of his mouth have been divisive ignorant narcissistic and demeaning and that's the stuff that comes out of his mouth who knows what he's actually thinking. people that think that way I don't want near the White House this country is not perfect yes….We always have room to grow… Every generation can try to make it better not make it worse "making America great again" The fact that we are so diverse the fact that we as a country agree to disagree is what makes is fabulous. There is no way to make America great again we are great! But we have to also be inclusive and treat people with respect and have a sense of common decencyand not look down our noses what other cultures add other people so therefore when somebody like trump is disrespectful I have no respect for him. He acts like a child and he is a 70-year-old man what form of confidence do you think I'm going to have going forward him being president it baffles my mind!
11 | Faye McKenna | 5 | 1558255610861130_1558316057521752 | Hillary would purge the nazi Russian scum thats infiltrated the FBI. Stablize Europe by calming fears that America IS NOT turning Nazi dispite Putins...FBI and Trumps best effort. Then shes gonna actually get working on infrastructure jobs...growing the economy that Obama put back on tracks after rethug rule derailed it and cost hundreds of thousands their jobs...in one nonth 900,000 jobs lost to incompotent rethug rule and then tried to default on debt TWICE...destroying our credit rating ...thanks Cruz.To prevent that from happening again she will enact stricter guide lines for getting into office. ..all rethugs must have higher IQ than their dog....thats day one...will cause uproar amongst rethugs cuz none of them meet that standard.
12 | Todd Cowart | 6 | 1558255610861130_1558304200856271 | This is a thought for those GOPers. Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016
13 | Vanessa Arrivillaga | 1 | 1558255610861130_1764257210502378 | We all know clintons plans, cus shes been very vocal in expressing exactly how she was going to utilize her first 100 days...while we are just guna have to wait for trump and keep trusting him since i have yet to hear exactly how he will accomplish anything while in office...
14 | David Pohocsucut | 2 | 1558255610861130_1558351840851507 | Clinton will impose sharia law for her Muslims, give away national secrets to China and Russia, open a baby murdering clinic in every corner, import as many Muslims as she possibly can and ultimately bring our country to civil war while simultaneously starting wars with other nations. She is evil to the core! TRUMP 2016!!!!!!!!!
15 | Cathy O'Connor | 6 | 1558255610861130_1558306267522731 | Clinton would be extremely busy returning favors to all her donors. She was bought and paid for by Wallstreet, Saudi Arabia, etc.  Wonder what Morroco's King expects from his $12 million?  Wake up people, there is still time. Please do not put this woman in power.
16 | Irek Kus | 6 | 1558255610861130_1558308614189163 | Clinton would sell our country piece by piece to the highest bidder, like she already has done. Selling American weapons to include anti aircraft missiles used against our military. Selling weapons to drug dealers in South America. Bribery would be the way to get things done if Hillary is voted in. It's made her and many others very rich so far.

19 | Bill Teichgraber | 0 | 1558255610861130_1558581967495161 | Naive realism does not serve anyone very well. What does the DNC, MSM, BHO, MO, JP, HA, WJC and HRC know about lying and misleading voters? It's an everyday method of operation in their playbook. No role models or examples of integrity to be found. When all the facts and truth finally surface, people will either be elated, devastated, relieved, enraged, or engaged in various forms of denial. The truth will be a tidal wave felt around the world.
20 | Deltron Polygraph | 0 | 1558255610861130_833673190105986 | Let's think about something rationally. When you own a company, you're the boss. You call the shots and everyone you hire, including your managers, are responsible for implementing your plan. A country, by contrast, has a President. This President doesn't tell Congress how the country should work. They all work together and cohabitate. In order to navigate that, you must be savvy and know how to work with the various groups; you don't just get to dictate how you want things done the way a business owner can. Let's keep that in mind when jumping to the conclusion that a (mostly failed) business man should run the country.
21 | Mark Pisanelli | 0 | 1558255610861130_1558444070842284 | Well Clinton would pardon Herself then have all evidence of Corruption destroyed, Then she would set into motion how much money her and Bill could make off the American people, then she would flood the Country with unvetted Refugees "Islamic Terrorists". Then she would move to destroy the 2nd amendment and the rest of the Constitution. The Woman is the Anti Christ. Pure Evil. People that support her are too Blind to see she is a terrible person and is out to finish what Obama didn't and that's destroying the Country the rest of the way. I mean look at her list of cronies, George Soros? Really. Wake up people.
22 | Jaffery Sayye | 1 | 1558255610861130_1764221183839314 | PRELUDE TO A PRESIDENT!!!What’s the difference between reality and perception??? Well that depends on who is taking your picture or if they’re writing your obituary. Those individuals who have actually met or befriended Donald Trump overwhelmingly share the same opinion that is… he’s a genuine, generous man who embraces and helps people from all walks of life; whether hosting a Royal Saudi diplomat at one of his prestigious hotels, aiding an ill child or thanking an everyday employee working in the shadows of his mailroom. However, because his critics love to highlight his unfiltered bravado, they immediately opt to demonize the messenger, tarnish his name to undermine his message, rather than earnestly debating the merits and validity of his message: i.e., America is being dismantled along economic, racial, and religious lines with little regard for the truth or the rule of law. For more than 30 years, well before the media and the Clinton campaign embarked on an “unbiased” crusade to paint Trump as a hateful xenophobe, he donated to both political parties and was widely praised for his social works, generosity, by celebrities and activists alike; those whose “infamous” ranks include Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Oprah Winfrey, and even the once-proud ‘Confederate’ Clintons themselves.As the progressive mob conspires daily to derail Trump’s growing popularity - a desperate attempt to convince America he is the modern day reincarnation of Hitler - they’re omitting one minute detail. He openly praises and encourages “legal” immigration, is married to an immigrant, and merely seeks to halt the costly epidemic of illegal immigration; something countless other presidential candidates have pledged to address for decades without their opponents ever inciting riots, silencing free speech or re-incarnating Nazi propaganda to deflect from their own failures. And yet before announcing his Presidential bid, Donald Trump…a global celebrity, entrepreneur and philanthropist…was never labeled a racist, a bigot or a “Nazi. How ironic. Not only are such assertions blatantly false, recklessly antagonistic, they belittle the memories and suffering of the countless victims who were actually murdered by a sadistic madman. Now who’s being callous and obtuse???Considering “character” was once the crux of presidential worthiness, what’s more relevant in choosing a credible, inspiring leader: someone who lends his time, money and resources to help critically ill children, families of slain cops, and struggling veterans - contributing to numerous legitimate charities - or a career politician who uses her own “charitable” foundation as a presidential slush fund to defraud natural disaster survivors??? Because “truth” is now a sexist term, that answer requires a full-time nurse, a liberal debate moderator and a private server. I guess when you’re selling future favors at the State Department and you’re personally knee-deep in Wall Street campaign vouchers, character and integrity are as expendable as the scandalous paper they’re printed on. Cuban cigar, anyone??? Duty and conscience free!!!If Donald Trump is guilty of anything it is for succeeding in a country predicated upon innovation, making a difference in the vacuum of others’ empty rhetoric and for speaking his mind without endless deception or unnecessary convolution. In my personal experiences, it is not the politically incorrect pragmatist that threatens liberty, security and prosperity, but the seasoned politician who cajoles, conspires and selectively reports the actual state of the union in order to more easily divide and conquer the voting masses. In other words, modern day progressives believe the best way to win a game of electoral chess is by sacrificing their perceived pawns; insulting voters’ intelligence with stale propaganda and endlessly pandering to their state-assisted sense of “victimization”. And all without ever achieving “real” change before the next election! However, when you shed the rusted shackles of blind allegiance and perceive America as a bastion of hope and opportunity, that power to transform one’s life resides in our God-given rights, the free will of every individual, and not the dictated terms of forced dependence and mass conformity. The power of “you” suddenly and rightfully supersedes the unconstitutional authority of the state. I’ll take an unfiltered, successful CEO over a dictator every time. Regardless of your personal attributes or political beliefs, the sensory overload of this divisive election can be remedied by answering one inescapable question. Do you believe the best way to ensure a prosperous, united and moral America is through an undying love of liberty, a transparent government, personal responsibility, an insatiable worth ethic and a healthy respect for this nation’s blessings…your fellow man??? Or do you believe the U.S. is an evil empire where true progress is characterized by teaching our children to despise America, by silencing intellectual diversity in our schools, condemning police but pardoning criminality, glorifying communism at the expense of freedom, declaring discrimination as exclusive but privacy as gender inclusive, labeling Christianity as hate speech while importing Islam, and by claiming that only American borders and immigration laws are racist and unjust??? If this stark dichotomy and chilling reality is by any means disturbing, a cultural conundrum, then by all means please allow me to present ‘The Common Sense Case for America’ before that choice may no longer duly exist. The most revealing questions are typically not the ones the mainstream media attempts to answer. The best questions are almost always the ones they refuse to ask.MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!MAKE THE WORLD SAFE AGAIN!!!#TrumpForPresident

Clinton would still have the far right obstructionist in congress that will blindly fight her just on principle, just like they did with Obama. Trump has a large part of the GOP that won't even support him during the election. I doubt they will support him as president and I doubt his policies would get much support from many Dems either.

She's become a really good candidate. Ezra Klein has a great piece about Hillary's greatest strength and it was listening. That conclusion came from her own aides and staffers throughout her career and included Republicans and Democrats she had worked with. I'm a Army Vet and #ImWithHer !

So sad to see them falling for this. She's using a black rapper to pull in votes, amongst other things. Using you people for votes, nothing more. She's disgusting.
3 | Marilyn Jones-Pebsworth | 463 | 1558162677537090_1558191440867547 | That's a laugh because Barack has set black people back sixty years! He shouldn't even be in the same sentence as Martin Luther King who actually helped make a better future for black children!!!

All the while she is facing multiple charges.Martha Stewart went to jail for lying to the FBI.

Ask yourselves, what has the first ever black president achieved for you blacks except more death to your son's and daughters in the street of America. I now believe it's a Devine curse upon we blacks for lack of wisdom and understanding. I just think you'll never wake up if you keep listening to brainwashed elevated slaves in fine dresses like Beyonce and her deluded husband. Keep foolishness up,you'll all receive your reward sooner or later.

Ever read your food label and what we are feeding our children? You must. Google the chemicals. Hillary was a Monsanto attorney and supported the dark act so that we wouldn't know our food source. Corrupt media and it all comes down to money. NBC is the worst! At least We have freedom of speech in this country and can denounce any public official and not get carted away in the middle of the night never to be heard from again.

There's a reason why we call them "Deplorables" .Last year at this time they were threatening to shoot transgender women for being in the "wrong" restroom and now they wan't to protect transgender women from Hillary and the Muslims and only Trump and his rabidly anti-gay rightwinger Christian running mate has the best interest of the LGBT community.LOL!

5 | Andrew Smith | 2 | 1558133020873389_1558380067515351 | Because God is so hateful that he would kill innocents just to prove a point? I'm pretty sure that there were Christian non-gay victims in those quakes. That's like blowing up a building because it's mostly occupied by Infadels.

So in the eyes of these religious nut cases with all the murder, rape and famine that god doesn't seem to care about fixing, his only concern is to punish people because gays are allowed to love one another and marry. Please go the way of the dodo you crazy loons. Now I'm not talking about normal christians, Catholics, Muslims and Jews to go the way of the dodo. Normal sane ones are really good people and don't go squawking stupidity and hatred out on the street corner.

The company plans to release a software update with a few tricks up its sleeve.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Amanda Abissi | 16 | 1558116857541672_1558145077538850 | I traded mine in for the s7 edge and sprint tried to screw me over on it. I was pissed. I am still really unhappy about this and really think that I shouldn't have to pay since it wasn't my fault the phone was faulty.
2 | Leonel Cordova | 21 | 1558116857541672_1558170934202931 | Should of got an iPhone 📱 in the first place. I always had a bad feeling about Samsung. I'm glad I never bought one ☝️ of those pieces of garbage.
3 | Elvira Silva Cortes | 18 | 1558116857541672_1558123660874325 | Well Samsung: I was always rooting for your products, but I have the Note 4 and since all those "forced updates" my phone turns off when the charge is at 84 percent... if I'm lucky, sometimes it won't turn off until it's on 74 percent sometimes it will even go to 68 or 64 percent..... can't wait to get rid of this phone. I'm done with Samsung.
4 | Erika Prophet-Payne | 4 | 1558116857541672_1558439500842741 | This is why i never get anything when it first comes out. The 3rd go around is when i buy stuff. Look at this phone, the ps4, and x box one, they all had problems the first go round.
5 | Ryan Shadrach Dev | 1 | 1558116857541672_1558395460847145 | Guys , I have one defence for these people who still own the Note 7, they might have switched the older battery for the updated variant (yea , disassembling the phone and switching out the battery and ribbon cables and what-not) , so I don't think its fair for Samsung to release an update to force the phone to do this , on the bright side , if those users have done such a thing to their phone , they would've switched over to a custom ROM but my worry now is that ROM developers are not interested in the developing ROMs for this phone since its in such low numbers , so Samsung , don't issue the update , just call those people up , not more
6 | Chase Tinkham | 0 | 1558116857541672_1558138414206183 | They better plan on getting them back. If they don't and it causes a problem and let's say the luggage compartment of an airplane and catches the whole bottom on fire. Samsung will take a major hit which will take them a long time to recover from. Not to mention the couple hundred dead bodies they'll be responsible for. That's a PR hit very few companies would be able to recover from. Samsung is one of them but it would take a while. Not to mention the tons of many other scenarios in which someone could lose their life to something that is spontaneously combustible

Abandoned the brand after being a loyal fan and went with the LGV20. Life is good 😊 won't ever go back.  For all the audio buffs out there the LGV20 will blow your mind using high end stereo headphones *removable battery and storage up to 2TB

10 | Melissa Archibald | 0 | 1558116857541672_1558476007505757 | Samsung makes good products but not this time. The problem was they forgot to tell people the phone doubles as a cigarette lighter :)
11 | Demilson Reis | 7 | 1558116857541672_1558197870866904 | If you used your Samsung phone to call about your exploded Samsung washer machine and wasn't killed in the process you are a lucky person...😂
12 | Kat Lagoon | 0 | 1558116857541672_1558449264175098 | Why wouldn't people just want to return them and get some new phone? Their fault if it blows up. They shouldn't get a replacement when that happens
13 | Joe McCarthy | 0 | 1558116857541672_1558541044165920 | They should be working just as hard to make a working new note. When I'm ready for upgrade, if something is not out, I'm going to htc. If they can't be consistent and reliable, I'm done with them
14 | Joseph Vitale | 2 | 1558116857541672_1558258320860859 | It these phones are such a danger then the phone companies should render them inoperable and force people to turn them in and get another phone....
15 | Kendra Winchell-Hellyer | 14 | 1558116857541672_1558126200874071 | Am I the only one whom has never had a problem with Samsung products? Love the phones, love the washer, love the smart TV and the dishwasher.

17 | Nick Wade | 14 | 1558116857541672_1558118167541541 | Clinton should have used Samsung products then she wouldn't have had to hammer 🔨 13 devices.
18 | Bruno Alexandre | 2 | 1558116857541672_1558144314205593 | In New Zealand, after November 18, this phone won't be able to connect to mobile networks anymore
19 | Ben Trin | 5 | 1558116857541672_1558119664208058 | And queue the overused, repetitive Samsung bomb jokes.
20 | Melissa Archibald | 1 | 1558116857541672_1558472190839472 | I have an LG K10 I am more than satisfied.
21 | Armando Pioquinto | 1 | 1558116857541672_1558119434208081 | Basically what they do every time a new phone comes out lol

23 | Joe Duschek | 1 | 1558116857541672_1558134447539913 | I guess Samsung shouldn't have employed all those Muslims after all!!!
24 | Necro Santiago | 1 | 1558116857541672_1558273990859292 | SAMSUNG ALL THEWAY!!! hurry up and get back on track...I'm not going to iPhone...I rebuke that devil company!!!
