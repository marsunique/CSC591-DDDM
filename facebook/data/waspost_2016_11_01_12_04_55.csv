Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are all but tied.

1 | Jack Carrenard | 2 | 10154790454984729_10154790663964729 | Director Comey is in cahoots with House Republicans to undermine the electoral process. The real question should be What did the Director know? And when did he know it? It turns out that the FBI knew for weeks about this new batch of emails. Comey waited until now to release the news so as to inflict as much damage to the Clinton campaign as possible. When told by his subordinates about deep troubling ties between the Russian Security Services and the Trump campaign, he refuses to publicize it for fear of hurting Trump's chances at the polls. DOUBLE STANDARD.
2 | Vinnie Moran | 2 | 10154790454984729_10154790603599729 | I guess quoting the NBC - Survey Monkey poll (Clinton leads by 6) would ruin the narrative being pushed here.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Carolyn Peterson | 9 | 10154787419919729_10154787726219729 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks.
2 | Kenny Ledbetter | 14 | 10154787419919729_10154787487364729 | Sorry HILLARY CLINTON, you can't "Click your heels together three times and say 'There's no place like home', for you are not Dorothy; in fact, your house has crashed on top of you. Ding dong the wicked witch is dead!!!
3 | Larry Finkelstein | 3 | 10154787419919729_10154787762399729 | Hillary Clinton received an email from a close relative, the Prince of Nigeria, to arrange moving government funds to her personal account. Why isn't the mainstream media reporting this?
4 | Carolyn Peterson | 0 | 10154787419919729_10154788862339729 | OMG OMG they found more emails to Hillary on a lap top! A lap top, I tell you! Pffttt Really? This is driving everyone nuts? Unless you can show me an email from Hillary saying that she passing classified emails out like Halloween candy and is loving it, don't bother me with this crap.
5 | Ronnie Rochelle | 1 | 10154787419919729_10154788960389729 | Oops ! They forgot about Weinar's computer. Can't wait for her to be the first POTUS impeached for lying to Congress. Or we could just look at the issues and vote Trump, but that would be the smart thing to do, and, apparently, nobody remembers the first go around, or the scandals, or the poor Middle East, or those one million refugees, or the pay for play, or the dirty debate trick on poor Bernie, or Travelgate, or the trade imbalance, or the negative manufacturing index, or ............
6 | David Martin | 1 | 10154787419919729_10154790592204729 | If Al Capone had the political protection, Hillary is shielded by, he would have been immune from indictment as well.
7 | Henrik Ahlm | 4 | 10154787419919729_10154787427744729 | Why vote Clinton and not Trump?It is one of the most simple questions to answer if you got a normal functioning brain.Like the editorial board of one of the world's most respected business newspapers said today:"Mrs Clinton carries enough baggage to fill a Boeing 747. She is not trusted by the majority of voters. But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US. Period!And U.S. gun owners - men in black are back on Election day!
8 | George Adams | 2 | 10154787419919729_10154788240449729 | STOP Election Fraud: Do NOT use Soros voting machines. Please vote to put Billery/Killery on trial for TREASON. She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleeding the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovreinity of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump.

What They Found Will RUIN HER LIFE Share on Facebook You’ve probably heard by now that NYPD obtained Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin’s home devices as part of an investigation into Weiner’s alleged “sexting” with underage girls… But the cops didn’t stop with them!To their complete shock, the NYPD ended up finding and raiding HILLARY’S property on those devices in the form of 650k emails connected to her personal email server…Now her private property is in the hands of the NYPD and FBI!An NYPD source just claimed that within the emails on that device, Hillary and Bill are directly implicated ins a MASSIVE child sex/trafficking ring along with their friend, and convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. (See Below)According to the source,“…It’s much more vile and serious than classified material on Weiner’s device. The emails DETAIL the trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary on their pedophile billionaire friend’s plane, the Lolita Express.”“We’re talking an international child enslavement and sex ring“These claims were backed up by other NYPD sources as well:Jeff Epstein is a level-3 registered sex offender and the media ignores the fact hat Bill Clinton flew 26 times on Epstein’s private Jet and allegedly visited Epstein’s sex slave island. Now that Hillary has also been directly implicated, the media cannot ignore this any longer! The NYPD source makes specific claims about her involvement. He says, “Hillary has a well documented predilection for underage girls, and Mr. Weiner could not bear to see those details deleted.” This will end up being the biggest scandal uncovered in election history! THIS NYPD SOURCE IS CLAIMING HILLARY IS A PEDOPHILE!SHARE THIS on Facebook because the media refuses to cover it! From Anon News,Sex rings are popular in all governments, but pedophilia is primarily in British parliament & Saudi Arabia, and that’s why HRC and BC love foreign donors so much. They get paid in children as well as money. Dig deep and you can find it. It will sicken you.

25 | Rita Diane Palmer | 3 | 10154787419919729_10154787690254729 | Trump’s trouble began on October 7, when The Washington Post released a video in which Trump boasts of sexually assaulting women. “You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful—I just start kissing them,” Trump said. “It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything.” He added, “Grab them by the pu.... You can do anything.” Women of America. is this the person you want your children to read about and hear what he says about women?Trump is facing a civil lawsuit from a Jane Doe who alleges that Trump raped her in 1994, when she was 13 years old, at parties hosted by the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who Trump called a friend. That lawsuit is scheduled to proceed in December, and Trump could be forced to testify under oath. There is also the trial in November where Donald Trump defrauded students who went to his fake university. Meanwhile, there are plenty of other questionable stories about Trump. Several former contestants in his pageants—including several teenagers—say Trump barged into changing rooms while they were naked or partially naked. Trump has avoided fraud charges so far. There is a good chance he will have a sentence for his upcoming court case of 20 years.

8 | Julie Elliott | 19 | 10154787276029729_10154787331664729 | Republican, Comey, trying to make a name for himself by tampering with the election process. No worries, this is how men treat a strong woman in the lead!
9 | Roya Rahie | 30 | 10154787276029729_10154787321584729 | Mrs Clinton is our next president, no matter what. Are you guys with me?

11 | Nicolas Juliao | 4 | 10154787276029729_10154787327294729 | Oligarchy. Bush, Bush, Clinton, Clinton, Obama, Clinton? C'mon folks. 30 years, career politician. SuperPac Hillary. DNC convention held at the Wells Fargo stadium. A major donor...to who? HRC.
12 | Beth Moyers | 5 | 10154787276029729_688028304680460 | Makes me sick as a parent paying for our daughters education that they would bring this monstrosity to Kent and shove her down the throats of our kids!!!
13 | Nicolas Juliao | 4 | 10154787276029729_10154787352124729 | Making decisions? Iraq, Benghazi, called TPP the gold standard, supporter of NAFTA, look at her emails closely. Poor judgement in staff.
14 | Suzanne Burch | 4 | 10154787276029729_10154787296304729 | Obama did not defend Comey. His press secretary neither defend nor confirmed his decision was a good one to come out with at this time.
15 | Debbie Wathen Clute | 19 | 10154787276029729_10154787319249729 | We already voted for Hillary and Democrats down the ballot!

19 | Mohamed Jama | 3 | 10154787276029729_10154787355534729 | She doesn't deserve to be lowered for all she did america and most of the world for someone who did not or bad norms , take a minute and think hard then decide
20 | Cheryl Nall Glover | 19 | 10154787276029729_10154787296254729 | I'm sick of the double standard applied to Hillary!!!

23 | Suzanne Burch | 11 | 10154787276029729_10154787330354729 | They say his supporters are mainly uneducated whites. How does that make you feel that this is the demographics trump has gone after. That this is really what he thinks of you. He will forget all about you if he's elected.
24 | Muhammad-Sirajuddin Molake | 2 | 10154787276029729_1181700148570816 | Robert Rodriguez is suffering from cognitive dissonance. If you can't beat Hillary you bear false witness against her. UnChristian behavior.

1 | Tom Tomaszewski | 66 | 10154787151884729_10154787236789729 | And the news is what? This isn't surprising and frankly you do business with the bum you deserve the trouble. Wait til he stiffs KellyAnne Conway
2 | Theresa Williams | 51 | 10154787151884729_10154787222724729 | I would say "no better for him", and he should have known better, etc., but by now anyone who gets involved with Trump should know better.  And if we are not careful this joker will be running our country like the con artist he is.
3 | Killian Walsh | 15 | 10154787151884729_10154787298854729 | And that folks is how he'll run the country, in and out of constant lawsuits and litigation. Oops can't go to a world event, got to go to court.
4 | Theo B. Dierks | 10 | 10154787151884729_10154787352864729 | My guess is there will never many, many ditched obligations after tRump loses...he will reimburse himself and his entities first no doubt
5 | Tracy Allen | 3 | 10154787151884729_10154787495089729 | Grist for the short attention span crowd.  Have you all forgotten that Hillary had >$8M in unpaid bills after her 2008 run and had to go hat in hand to President-elect Obama to bail her out before she ran afoul of Federal ethics rules (there's irony for you)?  Interestingly, as late as May 2013, Salon reported that Bill Clinton still had not retired all his campaign debt from the 1996 election.
6 | Anna Callahan | 9 | 10154787151884729_10154787348374729 | Donald J. Trump the lying crook who talked over the weekend at his rally's about a 'contract' he has with the American people is a joke. He is not capable of honoring a contract because Trump doesn't pay his bills or the contractors who have worked on his construction projects and casinos. He hasn't paid federal taxes in over TWO decades and still doesn't pay like the rest of the hardworking Americans pay taxes. Trump, show us your tax returns!
7 | George Adams | 0 | 10154787151884729_10154788240794729 | STOP Election Fraud: Do NOT use Soros voting machines. Please vote to put Billery/Killery on trial for TREASON. She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleeding the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovreinity of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump.
8 | Rafiki Kester Brown | 0 | 10154787151884729_10154789252114729 | Can Nigerians see here now that campaigns cost Money! There's a party who came to power giving us the impression that their opponent stole money to campaign yet not revealing the source of their own campaign funds. This party barely existed 2years to its victory. The world wants to know the magic they performed.
9 | Rhonda Elam Benedict | 1 | 10154787151884729_10154787688639729 | That's his reputation. He has no problem putting small businesses out of business and not paying his bills. That's why he has loans from foreign countries. No banks would loan him money here. Embarrassment for the USA.
10 | Carl D. Schroeder | 3 | 10154787151884729_10154787431584729 | Possibly, but HOW did they arrive at those results? There's a vast right wing conspiracy against the outsider Trump. The left as well. No one in politics want Trump to shake it all up.
11 | Henrik Ahlm | 4 | 10154787151884729_10154787363649729 | Why vote Clinton and not Trump?It is one of the most simple questions to answer if you got a normal functioning brain.Like the editorial board of one of the world's most respected business newspapers said today:"Mrs Clinton carries enough baggage to fill a Boeing 747. She is not trusted by the majority of voters. But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US. Period!And U.S. gun owners - men in black are back on Election day!
12 | Bella Dina | 1 | 10154787151884729_10154787705159729 | Goes to the deceptive candidate he has been, as sinister as his refusal to show Americans  his taxes!He will never be transparent!!!
13 | Kathryn Rubenstein | 22 | 10154787151884729_10154787158309729 | I'm sure Trump sued this guy. He sues everyone. Trump is going to be very busy after the election that he loses with suing everyone in sight.
14 | Kenny Ledbetter | 3 | 10154787151884729_10154787484669729 | Sorry HILLARY CLINTON, you can't "Click your heels together three times and say 'There's no place like home', for you are not Dorothy; in fact, your house has crashed on top of you. Ding dong the wicked witch is dead!!!
15 | Danny Babcock | 0 | 10154787151884729_10154790219914729 | “Trump is really not qualified.”  -- Just look back at his daily temper tantrums over the course of his campaign!!! He brings the Tasmanian-Devil to mind… he acts and talks just like the cartoon character. Hillary Clinton isn’t perfect, but after the three debates, it’s very clear Trump doesn’t have the intelligence, or temperament to be President. Now add Trump’s daily ranting and tweeting about everyone and thing, that’s “out to get him”, it's the Media, it’s the Clintons, it’s the Establishment, it's rigged polls, his shorts are too tight, it’s those women or/and it’s the corrupt system that's doing it to little Donald Trump. “That person in your mind’s eye – is - Donald Trump!” Does that imagine look like someone who should be President of the United States?  --- I sure don’t think so! Please VOTE!!!

18 | Jennifer Tislerics | 9 | 10154787151884729_10154787220139729 | He probably didn't like the poll results showing him losing, hence "shoddy work" that he doesn't feel he should pay for. That's his usual M.O.
19 | Paul David Menser | 7 | 10154787151884729_10154787246744729 | Whoever it was should have known better. It's not like Trump isn't a legend when it comes to stiffing people.
20 | Lucy Garcia | 3 | 10154787151884729_10154787285214729 | Grasping at straws aren't you? Hispanic Democrats for Trump!
21 | Colleen Pond | 1 | 10154787151884729_10154787373334729 | He doesn't pay kids who he gets working for him, look for Freedom Kids lawsuit against Trump. http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-hasn-paid-10-top-staffers-article-1.2776256 This was in the Daily news ages ago.
22 | Ellen Silva Barry | 1 | 10154787151884729_10154787377179729 | Of course. He probably didnt like the poll numbers he was getting. He'll stiff him just like he stiffs so many others.
23 | Annette Geisler | 3 | 10154787151884729_10154787335194729 | Of course! That's what he always does. Despicable human beings operate like that.
24 | Suzanne Teten Vitale | 2 | 10154787151884729_10154787254169729 | Why am I not surprised? This is Donald's modus operandi. The pollster should have known better.

The only remedy The Hatch Act allows is the immediate removal of Director Comey from his position. NOW.

3 | Annabelle Collins | 6 | 10154786686014729_10154786936669729 | Republicans have been convinced since the 1990s that the Clintons are criminals. They have spent 25 years and millions of dollars from the public treasury investigating the couple. And they now point to the 25 years of investigation as evidence that the Clintons must be engaged in some sort of criminal activity. Perhaps they are, but the GOP hasn't had much luck uncovering it.
4 | Sharon Lietaert | 2 | 10154786686014729_10154786785689729 | A newly released email from WikiLeaks is just the latest evidence of the cozy relationship between the Clinton campaign and CNN.The February 2015 email entitled "Heads up - between us" shows that CNN sources leaked the results of polls to the Clinton campaign prior to publishing them. The results were leaked initially to Joel Benenson, a pollster and the Chief Strategist to Clinton campaign. They were then forwarded to chairman John Podesta, campaign manager Robby Mook, and Clinton aid Huma Abedin amongst others."I think you are going to enjoy a poll we have releasing tomorrow morning at 6:00 am ET that asks about 2016ers and whether they are perceived as candidates of the past or candidates of the future," the email from a "source" at CNN reads. "Some interesting findings..."This isn't the first time CNN's journalistic integrity has been called into question by a leaked email. Earlier this month it was revealed that interim chairperson of the DNC Donna Brazile had leaked a debate question to the Clinton campaign.

Not to mention 12 women coming forward anout being sexually assaulted, not paying bills for campaign, etc. And absolutely no documented history of public service. Fact check has him over 80% of what he says,are lies;roughly 8 out of 10 statements are lies....not bending the truth but out right falsehoods. He wont win this campaign he considers a throne, his personal kingdom. He is a king without clothing. A con man who has played his biggest con job.....
6 | Annabelle Collins | 1 | 10154786686014729_10154789457569729 | The word "explosive" has been rendered meaningless in this US presidential election – so I'll just state this baldly. The FBI is investigating a deliberate, years-long Russian effort by which Moscow co-opted Donald Trump, and the Republican Party candidate had, until very recently, a super-secret internet server, which carried heavy, two-way traffic between his Manhattan tower and a Russian bank with close ties to the Kremlin.

10 | Annabelle Collins | 0 | 10154786686014729_10154789137964729 | A VETERAN spy has reportedly come forward with information about Donald Trump and his ties with Russia, after calls yesterday for the FBI to release “explosive information” on the relationship.According to Mother Jones, the former spy compiled a report on the Republican presidential candidate while working for a private company. The memo, which has been provided to the FBI, claims Russian intelligence had “compromised” Mr Trump during his visits to Moscow and could “blackmail him.”The former Western intelligence officer reportedly spent almost 20 years working on Russian intelligence matters and now works for a US firm gathering information on Russia for corporate clients.He was asked to research Mr Trump’s dealings in Russia in June.What he found was so serious he gave a copy of his report to the FBI without the permission of his employer.According to his sources, he said, “there was an established exchange of information between the Mr Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.”Mother Jones has reviewed the report and other memos the former spy wrote.The first memo, based on his conversations with Russian sources, noted, “Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.”It maintained that Mr Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.”It memo claimed Russian intelligence had “compromised” Mr Trump during his visits to Moscow and could “blackmail him.”Intelligence had also created a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on “bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.”The former spy said the response from the FBI was “shock and horror.”
11 | Henrik Ahlm | 2 | 10154786686014729_10154786987789729 | Why vote Clinton and not Trump?It is one of the most simple questions to answer if you got a normal functioning brain.Like the editorial board of one of the world's most respected business newspapers said today:"Mrs Clinton carries enough baggage to fill a Boeing 747. She is not trusted by the majority of voters. But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US. Period!And U.S. gun owners - men in black are back on Election day!

According to reports, at least 6 members of Congress and several leaders from federal agencies are implicated in the pedophile ring, which they say was run directly with the Clinton Foundation as a front. According to an NYPD source, emails found on Anthony Weiner’s laptop detail trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary Clinton on convicted pedophile pal billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s plane ‘Lolitta express‘ to a place known as “Sex Slave Island“.

2 | Cheryl Heymans | 2 | 10154786039314729_10154786627914729 | Guess the establishment, the DNC and the billionaire corporate masters shouldn't have crowned Hillary Queen before anyone else entered the race. Because we all know that Bernie’s campaign offered hope and change, with no daily scandals but we're stuck with the most despised and least trustworthy Dem candidate of all time.
3 | Ronnie Rochelle | 3 | 10154786039314729_10154786378714729 | So much hope, yet so little results. The most racially divisive president in our history. Foreign policy.. worse than Carter which is saying a lot !
4 | Daniel Mochrie | 7 | 10154786039314729_10154786122459729 | He shouldn't be he was involved in criminal activities on Hillary's home brewed server. He should not be shocked at all. The FBI need to file charges on him to for lying about it.

Worse president since Jimmy Carter.Doubled the deficit, absolutely killed manufacturing ( see graph ), and letISIS and Russia overrun the Middle East among a long list of very poorpolicies. Do you realize that we would be a third world economy, if not forthe dollar's status as a world currency ?Seriously ! Our GDP to deficit isworse than Greece's !

Michelle Obama may have a bright future in politics.

Trump is for Law and Order and as he says Hillary should be in jail. Hillary is the one who "KNOWS" Putin, sold our uranium to Putin so Putin could in turn sell part to Iran, so they can make a bomb to kill us/our children/our grandchildren. Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of America. I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself. Hillary threatened Bill women who he molested/raped/attempted to molest on National TV, sent private detectives to dig up dirt on them and had them ALL audited by the IRS. Hillary stands for open borders, for a One World Government but Trump stands for America and Americans.

This is their “Form 990” required by the IRS for all charities. In 2013 they had total revenue of $148,889,439 (Line 12). Their TOTAL Grants to Charity were $8,865,052 (Line 13). That is a measly 5.95%!!!!! Now, they are so efficient that it cost them a total of $84,684,494 in expenses (Line 18) to give away $8,865,052 to charity!!!!Including $29,914,108 in salaries (Line 15), $185,970 in fundraising fees (Line 16a, that’s actually legitimate), and a WHOPPING $45,719,364 (Line 17) in “other expenses”!!!!!So AFTER all that hard charitable work they end the year with $247,299,458 (Line 22), a cool $100,000,000 more than was contributed for The year!!! Folks, no matter how you slice and dice it, this is simply a blatant money laundering program. They don’t even try to hide it!!!

We haven't heard from any reliable sources as to whose emails they actually are, whose device it was, etc. It is obvious that you are becoming angered at anyone speaking to the, let's wait and see instead of jumping to conclusions based on a letter of non evidence of anything, besides the fact Comey got his feeling hurt by coworkers not speaking to him and his admissions he spoke to his wife Katherine about ongoing FBI classified investigations.

But, his appeal is not really about him. It’s about racism, sexism, anti-semitism, and every intolerant “ism” you can imagine. The people who live to hate would support any candidate or any party that promotes division and hatred. These are the same people who waged a war against the nation’s first African American president, Barack Obama. They are now ready to block the first female president.The divisions Trump’s supporters foolishly seek would weaken this country from within and could only benefit the likes of a Putin, Iran or ISIS. But bigotry and common sense often cancel each other out.Indeed, Trump’s appeal isn’t about his qualifications, his shady deals, his tax dodging, his insulting veterans, his treatment of women and people of color. His supporters couldn’t care less about those issues. They care about their hate, and Trump is popular with them because he has become the flagbearer of hatred in this country. Fortunately, this country has far more good people than bad.All decent Americans should get out and vote, not just against Trump, but against all the Republican senators and representatives who endorsed him.Lyrics from the movie South Pacific about hate.written by Rodgers and Hammerstein.“You've got to be taughtTo hate and fear,You've got to be taughtFrom year to year,It's got to be drummedIn your dear little earYou've got to be carefully taught.You've got to be taught to be afraidOf people whose eyes are oddly made,And people whose skin is a diff'rent shade,You've got to be carefully taught.You've got to be taught before it's too late,Before you are six or seven or eight,To hate all the people your relatives hate,You've got to be carefully taught!”

10 | Danny Babcock | 0 | 10154786033429729_10154787120659729 | The emails are JUST SMOKE --There are questions to answer about how the FBI Director informed on the Clinton emails to review… but, the fact is how he did it just stirred things up! The Director “should have” shared that even after the FBI reviews the Anthony Weiner computer emails, there is little chance any charges will be filed against Clinton and  “Careless but not Criminal ”, included in the FBI's original case evaluation will stand. Several legal experts have since shared that in fact that there is little chance any new charges will result from the review. The FBI determined that even careless handling of classified information did not make Clinton guilty of a crime. FBI hasn’t reviewed them yet; but the FBI shared that some, if not all, will be likely be copies of emails they already have.
11 | Henrik Ahlm | 0 | 10154786033429729_10154787609229729 | Why vote Clinton and not Trump?It is one of the most simple questions to answer if you got a normal functioning brain.Like the editorial board of one of the world's most respected business newspapers said today:"Mrs Clinton carries enough baggage to fill a Boeing 747. She is not trusted by the majority of voters. But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US. Period!Nobody, who loves America, wants a President, who secretly enjoys a sexsual relationship with Putin. Putin - the serious rumour says - makes Trump crawl on the floor while Putin whips Trumps hairdue with a goosefeather all the while Trump beggs for mercy and cries out loud. The rumour also has it that a certain gay speculator from Silicon Valley likes to join in.And U.S. gun owners - men in black are back on Election day! Either you are with us, you deplorable gunnies, or you are against us!

According to reports, at least 6 members of Congress and several leaders from federal agencies are implicated in the pedophile ring, which they say was run directly with the Clinton Foundation as a front. According to an NYPD source, emails found on Anthony Weiner’s laptop detail trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary Clinton on convicted pedophile pal billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s plane ‘Lolitta express‘ to a place known as “Sex Slave Island“.

FBI Director James Comey is under fire for his decision to tell Congress that investigators may have found new emails related to the Clinton email investigation. 
 
Reporters Sari Horwitz and Abby Phillip explain the latest details in the story and its effects on the final days of the presidential campaign.

6 | Suzanne Burch | 119 | 10154786389619729_10154786616614729 | Yes Hillary caused this by having a private server but she isn't the only one who did this and no one went after them. Witch hunt plain and simple. And this is a partisan run witch hunt.

8 | Tami Lynn | 55 | 10154786389619729_10154786638979729 | Comey made a bad call but just as he found NOTHING to indict her the first time, he will find nothing now. These aren't even her emails!

10 | Melissa Morse | 45 | 10154786389619729_10154786602539729 | I'm voting for Hillary Clinton. Comey did the unthinkable- he wrote to Jason Chaffetz before he wrote to ranking Democrats
11 | Donna Clark | 44 | 10154786389619729_10154786642384729 | Republicans should be embarrassed to have nominated a rappest,biggoted,lieing,thief
12 | Ben Webb | 28 | 10154786389619729_10154786618559729 | So Secretary Clinton flubbed email handling. What is supposedly to be found in these emails; what is the possible smoking gun we should all be so bothered about?

16 | John Davidson | 29 | 10154786389619729_10154786628544729 | Why is Hillary being held to standards above those which previously held the same position? Why isn't there a desire to solve and protect the next heads of state from these types of scandals?

21 | Renée Mauzy | 18 | 10154786389619729_1255624691127082 | I support Comey's action, based on what's been released in the media. I think it's relevant to voters making an informed decision on who to vote for for president. I am a Democrat, and I will vote for Clinton.
22 | John Davidson | 11 | 10154786389619729_10154786636689729 | It's seams that head hunting HILLARY has taken lead over fixing the obviously broken system. Nothing is ever discussed about what actions are being taken to solve this from ever happening again.
23 | Pam Krogness | 10 | 10154786389619729_10154786627009729 | Wake up! Hillary is an unethical, dishonest person. Read Armageddon by Dick Morris. Comey has courage and shouldn't be villified. When the truth comes up, this is a typical tactic.
24 | Gregory Epler | 17 | 10154786389619729_1255655564457328 | Director James Comey needs to resign immediately, his blatant political stunt will cause damage to the agency for decades . . .

Although October — and its surprises — have become cliche in politics at this point, it’s hard to remember a final month of a presidential campaign that has contained so many twists and turns.

The thing I love about this the most is that there is nothing you or the lying Media can lie about, or blame Trump for on this matter. This is all Hillary's mess and she only will have to answer for her corrupt ways.The good news is that Bill Clinton is very happy it wasn't his Weiner that got Hillary in trouble this time.

5 | Alex Alvarado | 4 | 10154784402249729_10154785024144729 | Copy from Facebook page of Kevin M Carney(opposing Views.) A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!

Do you know the Government handouts that Trump has so far collected from GOVERNMENT, all by himself, by his own admission, is so much bigger than the handouts that millions of supposed single moms of America has collected as “Gov. Handouts”? No wonder, they call you “Rednecks” & “deplorables”.Corporate America is collecting more Government Handouts than all people on welfare list (X 10).

The Saturday afternoon incident in Phoenix, which was captured on video, revived long-standing anxieties about xenophobic and white supremacist rhetoric used by a fringe faction within the GOP nominee’s base.

1 | Danny Babcock | 14 | 10154784385319729_10154784702644729 | Trump’s own big mouth is killing him... and on a daily basis. Then he picks Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani has two of his pallbearers. Trump is coming unglued! The man is insane. He brings the Tasmanian-Devil to mind, he acts and talks just like the cartoon character. Clinton isn’t perfect, but after the three debates, it’s very clear Trump doesn’t have the intelligence, or temperament to be President. Now add that Trump knows he's in trouble, so it's the Media, it’s the Clintons, it’s the Establishment, it's rigged polls, his shorts are too tight, it’s those women, it’s the rigged and corrupt system that's doing it to little Donny Trump. If the Democrats could rig elections why are the House and Senate in Republican control? If elections could be rigged, the GOP sure as hell wouldn’t have Trump as their nominee.

Do you know the Government handouts that Trump has so far collected from GOVERNMENT, all by himself, by his own admission, is so much bigger than the handouts that millions of supposed single moms of America has collected as “Gov. Handouts”? No wonder, they call you “Rednecks” & “deplorables”.Corporate America is collecting more Government Handouts than all people on welfare list (X 10).

Claims he gave a whole bunch of money to several Charites, but there is no record.  Instead, uses “Other-People’s-Money” to pay his lawsuits, buy portraits of himself and sports memorabilia.

It would turn us backwards 30 yearsTRUMP AND HIS TOP ADVISORS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI FOR HIS TIES TO RUSSIA AND PUTIN!LETTER FROM HARRY REID TO FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY:Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) says that FBI director James Comey is sitting on “explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.”Comey isn’t telling the American public what he knows about Trump and the Russians, Reid says. But, he says, Comey seems eager to dish dirt on Hillary Clinton.In the course of investigating Anthony Weiner for sexual misconduct, the FBI gained access to a computer that had also been used by Weiner’s estranged wife, senior Hillary Clinton advisor Huma Abedin. The computer contained emails that may have been relevant to the FBI’s earlier investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private email server.When Comey found out about the computer, Reid points out, he notified Congress immediately — if vaguely — that the FBI had come across this new evidence. In Reid’s view, that presented a strong and troubling contrast to the FBI’s silence over Trump’s supposed Kremlin ties.“The double standard established by your actions is clear,” Reid writes.This letter is serious business. Reid writes that “my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act” — the law that prohibits most federal employees from engaging in partisan political activity.“Through your partisan actions,” he tells Comey, “you may have broken the law.”The Hatch Act is what prevents members of the US military from attending political rallies in uniform, or government workers from wearing campaign pins to work. In other words, it applies to activity that’s a lot less significant than what Reid is accusing Comey and the FBI of: selectively telling the public about information that could be damaging to one candidate, while not telling it about information that could be (much more) damaging to her opponent.“The clear double standard established by your actions,” Reid concludes, “strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group.Will be updated regularlyIF YOU CARE, SHARE!#HillYes #Hillary45 #ImWithHer #Hillary2016 #BlueLandslide #StrongerTogether #ClintonKaine2016 #HillaryClinton2016 #VoteBlueUpAndDownTheBallot

Trump is for Law and Order and as he says Hillary should be in jail. Hillary is the one who "KNOWS" Putin, sold our uranium to Putin so Putin could in turn sell part to Iran, so they can make a bomb to kill us/our children/our grandchildren. Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of America. I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself. Hillary threatened Bill women who he molested/raped/attempted to molest on National TV, sent private detectives to dig up dirt on them and had them ALL audited by the IRS. Hillary stands for open borders, for a One World Government but Trump stands for America and Americans.

1 | Carolyn Peterson | 17 | 10154782528699729_10154782761899729 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks.

Bush administration. Between 2003 and 2009, the Bush White House “lost” 22 million emails. This correspondence included millions of emails written during the darkest period in America’s recent history, when the Bush administration was ginning up support for what turned out to be a disastrous war in Iraq with false claims that the country possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and, later, when it was firing U.S. attorneys for political reasons."

Watergate, covered by excellent fair and balanced reporting by the main stream media, destroyed Nixon at a time the Law and Order prevailed in America. Watergate was very minor compared to what is happening now with the emails and practices which Rudy Giulianni, an ex-prosecuting attorney, said clearly are fall under RICO charges and should be brought in front of a Grand Jury. http://freebeacon.com/politics/clinton-aides-memo-details-ties-consulting-firm-clinton-foundation/?utm_source=Freedom+Mail&utm_campaign=bab3aef7f6-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_10_28&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b5e6e0e9ea-bab3aef7f6-46059981

She's had the momentum and will still most likely win, but come on, the dirty tricks are so transparent and evil. I've heard people say Comey is a straight shooter but that's what they said about Petraeus and look how that turned out. I'm voting for Clinton.

Do you know the Government handouts that Trump has so far collected from GOVERNMENT, all by himself, by his own admission, is so much bigger than the handouts that millions of supposed single moms of America has collected as “Gov. Handouts”? No wonder, they call you “Rednecks” & “deplorables”.Corporate America is collecting more Government Handouts than all people on welfare list (X 10).

And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that’s where we are…Is it a certainty that we won’t learn before the election? I’m not sure it’s a certainty we won’t learn before the election.IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT BERNSTEIN  IS A HILLARY SUPPORTER BUT EVEN HE KNOWS THIS IS HUGE. HE CALLED INTO CNN TO OFFER HIS ANALYSIS ❗️These are Carl Bernstein's opinions and not mine.

Trump is for Law and Order and as he says Hillary should be in jail. Hillary is the one who "KNOWS" Putin, sold our uranium to Putin so Putin could in turn sell part to Iran, so they can make a bomb to kill us/our children/our grandchildren. Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of America. I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself. Hillary threatened Bill women who he molested/raped/attempted to molest on National TV, sent private detectives to dig up dirt on them and had them ALL audited by the IRS. And you want to call me delusional, I do believe I have proven here WITH FACTS who is delusional. Now try to have a nice day!!!!!

This is their “Form 990” required by the IRS for all charities. In 2013 they had total revenue of $148,889,439 (Line 12). Their TOTAL Grants to Charity were $8,865,052 (Line 13). That is a measly 5.95%!!!!! Now, they are so efficient that it cost them a total of $84,684,494 in expenses (Line 18) to give away $8,865,052 to charity!!!!Including $29,914,108 in salaries (Line 15), $185,970 in fundraising fees (Line 16a, that’s actually legitimate), and a WHOPPING $45,719,364 (Line 17) in “other expenses”!!!!!So AFTER all that hard charitable work they end the year with $247,299,458 (Line 22), a cool $100,000,000 more than was contributed for The year!!! Folks, no matter how you slice and dice it, this is simply a blatant money laundering program. They don’t even try to hide it!!! Oh and Congress wanted to investigate the Clinton Foundation and the DOJ stepped in and blocked it!

So far, there have been no criminal charges, and therefore no convictions or guilty pleas in the Clinton email scandal.

18 | Moji Hoss | 1 | 10154782531359729_10154785976529729 | People who are collecting Government handouts…Trump supporters, the Rednecks of America, or as Hillary call them the “basket of deplorables” are usually consumed with the so called people who are " just looking for government handouts that future generations will have to pay for." Do you know the Government handouts that Trump has so far collected from GOVERNMENT, all by himself, by his own admission, is so much bigger than the handouts that millions of supposed single moms of America has collected as “Gov. Handouts”? No wonder, they call you “Rednecks” & “deplorables”.Corporate America is collecting more Government Handouts than all people on welfare list (X 10).
19 | Danny Babcock | 0 | 10154782531359729_10154783730354729 | There are questions to answer about how the FBI Director informed on the Clinton emails to review… but, the fact is how he did it just stirred things up! The Director “should have” shared that even after the FBI reviews the Anthony Weiner computer emails, there is little chance any charges will be filed against Clinton and  “Careless but Criminal ”, included in the FBI's original case evaluation will stand. Several legal experts have since shared that in fact that there is little chance any new charges will result from the review. FBI hasn’t reviewed them yet; but the FBI shared that some, if not all, will be likely be copies of emails they already have.

And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation.

1 | Timothy Madsen Sr. | 18 | 10154782519319729_10154782723199729 | So the FBI has had this laptop for 5 weeks and hasn't even gotten a warrant to look at it? Yet the Republican Director feels the need to memo the Congress 11 days before election day?
2 | Marty Dart | 12 | 10154782519319729_10154782634679729 | The investigation that isn't an investigation into emails that may or may not be on a computer, may or may not be from Hillary, and may or may not be emails they've already seen?...that "investigation"?
3 | Carolyn Peterson | 8 | 10154782519319729_10154782766294729 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks.
4 | Jay Villaluna | 6 | 10154782519319729_10154782725639729 | Another much ado about nothing. People on Trump side keep harping on about emails, yet strangely these emails are from aides and not Clinton's herself.
5 | Sara Drake | 1 | 10154782519319729_10154783491424729 | "As WND reported Sept. 8, Clinton forwarded an Aug. 8, 2009, email – clearly marked “Classified” – to a personal, nonsecure email address registered to aide Abedin, huma@clintonemail.com. Abedin then forwarded the message to another personal, nonsecure account, humamabedin@yahoo.com.In sworn testimony before Congress, however, Clinton declared, “There was nothing marked classified on my emails, either sent or received.”The 2009 email, sent to Clinton from longtime adviser Sidney Blumenthal, was discovered in a cache of emails obtained by Judicial Watch through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The exchange concerned the “disastrous nature” of an Obama trip to Germany, charging the U.S. was “totally out of the loop in Berlin – no ambassador,” resulting in the expectation that “Germans and Russians will now cut their own separate deals on energy, regional security, etc.”WND also reported two-thirds of Abedin’s released emails were forwarded to personal addresses she controlled and Clinton’s State Department chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, may have received classified information through personal email accounts.Read more at http://www.wnd.com/2016/10/hillary-sent-marked-classified-info-to-nonsecure-abedin-account/#XODOuRgmbgoUYLSR.99
6 | Badr AlMehmadi | 1 | 10154782519319729_10154783822379729 | "Throughout this campaign, Mr. Trump has demonstrated an inability to handle criticism or blame well. His first instinct is to lash out at others. When challenged, he often responds as a child might. He makes a sour face, he calls people by insulting names, he waves his arms, he impatiently interrupts. Most families would not allow their children to remain at the dinner table if they behaved as Mr. Trump does. He has not exhibited the self-control, the discipline, or the emotional depth necessary to function credibly as a President of the United States.From the beginning of his campaign, Mr. Trump has conjured up enemies. First it was eleven million criminals in our midst, all bent on obtaining the benefits of citizenship, at our expense. Over time, the enemies became any trading partner of the United States. He says they are nothing but foreigners seeking to threaten our livelihoods. Now we have reached the point where his idea of America’s enemies includes almost anyone who talks or looks different from him. The goal of the Trump campaign, from the outset, has been to stir up envy, resentment, and group hatred.This is the worst of American politics. I fear for our cohesion as a nation, and for our place in the world, if this man who is unwilling to say he will abide by the result of our national election becomes our President.This is not the time to cast a jocular or feel-good vote for a man whom you may have briefly found entertaining. Donald Trump should not, cannot, and must not be elected President of the United States.” - Bill Weld Oct 2016
7 | Moji Hoss | 0 | 10154782519319729_10154785977319729 | FBI is Re-opening the Hillary File My last name is "Itold you so".This announcement by Mr. Comey is purely political announcement, 100%, no doubt. Never. Ever, FBI would drop a bomb on election, because of purely uncertain situation that may or may not be serious;  Director, James B. Comey: “we don’t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.’’ & "The FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant," Director Comey has a responsibility in this situation to say, okay my deputies that find all this information on Weiner’s computer, I have to study this information carefully “myself” before I could make any decision on them, and therefore could take his time till after the election for any correct decision making.I think President Obama should respond to his political move by his FBI Director very Forcefully and very Quickly.

10 | Kris Payne | 0 | 10154782519319729_10154785029689729 | Right lol...Hillary Clinton is saying it is unprecedented that the FBI would inject itself this close to Election Day and many of her media supporters just go along as they do with everything else she says or does.Hillary knows full well that special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh actually indicted Casper Weinberger four days prior to Bill Clinton's election in 1992. As with almost everything Hillary does, she lies.As for unprecedented: Never before have we had a presidential candidate who:- As Secretary of State used a private server and broke the nation's security laws by trafficking classified documents on non-secure devices- Unilaterally decided which E mails to dump. Does anyone actually believe that the number she destroyed was only 33,000? These E Mails were bleach bitted after a Congressional Subpoena. Does anyone believe only personal E mails were destroyed?- As Secretary of State approved the sale of uranium reserves to the Russians and diverted money from the Haitians to her friends and family. She has taken kickbacks throughout her adult life starting with the $100,000 for cattle futures almost 40 years ago.- When answering questions to the FBI and Judicial Watch her most favorite go-to answer was I do not recall. This has been her favorite answer throughout her adult life. She is repeatedly described as extremely intelligent. Did she actually not recall or did she lie? If she didn't lie does anyone want anyone with that poor a memory as President?- Had a White House, State Department, Justice Department and others who also violated security laws and therefore spent their time protecting the Presidential candidate instead of working for the American people.- Had subordinates, who like her, were willing to commit perjury to protect themselves and her.- Had an FBI director and Attorney General who essentially admit that she violated the law but decided that she might not understand the law so wouldn't charge her. That is mind-boggling.- Had a media that was so in the tank that they have never cared what she actually did or said. Can anyone imagine the reporting on WikiLeaks if it were her opponent’s secrets being revealed?Now, all of a sudden this candidate who has spent her entire adult life hiding and lying demands pretends that she wants complete transparency from the FBI.The media, Democrats and Hollywood knew who they were getting with Hillary, a law breaker, perjurer and serial liar, and they always looked the other way.  But now they are outraged that someone in Government might actually do their job because they want power, nothing else.The news media knew most or all of this before they endorsed her. They have made a great effort to keep the public uninformed on what Hillary has said and done. They should be embarrassed that they endorsed her. Now they are essentially saying the election is rigged because the FBI might actually do its job.
11 | Hazel Higgins Remy | 0 | 10154782519319729_10154787468079729 | I think that Hillary didn't really delete her emails. They said that Weiner was also using Hillary's server. So instead of actually deleting her emails, Hillary wanted to hide them somewhere no one would ever think to look. She hid them on Weiner computer never thinking that they would be found. I'm sure Abiden knew they were there. Hillary would never have been able to transfer them by herself to the Weiner computer.
12 | Su La | 1 | 10154782519319729_10154783447649729 | The point is that it violates State Dept Regs in FAM to take classified home and/or send classified over an unsecured system.  Huma did both.  That's the starting point.
13 | Jason Rosenthal | 8 | 10154782519319729_10154782632059729 | Could the FBI figure out who keeps dumping these pirated movies spam in every comment thread? May that is what Huma and Hillary were emailing between each other.
14 | Richard Klein | 1 | 10154782519319729_10154783777334729 | People understand Stronger Together is the grand design for human survival and, a peace of mind. I love I'm with the party of beautiful caring people with a great convention and, historical speeches. I fear nothing. I don’t have near the women problem Trump has. The sky is not falling. Yes, I favor the democrat issues. My healthcare is good and, I feel great. I selected my own primary care doctor and, gained many other essential things. So, if you think some of Trump’s voters are going to stop us from being Stronger Together, you are so wrong! We don’t mean any ill feelings. I realize some may have gotten a grudge. But, that’s you and, not us. Democrats did not   try to default on the nation’s debt. The debt is a serious matter. This tells me the republicans do not have educated thinkers to run this country. The country could have been seriously harmed or, destroyed. The Republicans will ride any wave that comes their way if it will grab them power, including electing this habitual sexist liar Trump for President. Republicans think they don’t have to take any responsibility for anything no matter how heinous it is. Republicans may have another 8 years to re-think their, “I got an axe to grind!” and their, “hate” behavior. The world is much better and, bigger than what the republicans can see. So, I don’t expect them to see, Stronger Together with her is truly the only place for me.

I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they?

Ever since Trump launched his presidential campaign in June 2015, he has attracted massive crowds to rallies across the country. 
But instead of celebrating the actual size of these crowds, Trump has routinely exaggerated the already large numbers.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kathryn Rubenstein | 34 | 10154782517804729_10154782521649729 | His rallies are just a bunch of poorly educated bullies. They can follow Trump all the way to Trump TV when he loses BIG LEAGUE.
2 | Melinda Francais | 7 | 10154782517804729_10154783430754729 | Don't care how big they are....do the math...because most of the Trump supporters are at his rallies, and those numbers might add up to, maybe, a million people...and that's just not enough to win an election. Meanwhile...Hillary has the awesome 'ground game', and ground games win elections.
3 | Mandy Freeman Mcconico | 8 | 10154782517804729_10154782585534729 | Lol! Desperate attempt by the post yet again.😂 You're talking to the people and we have been to these rallies (both candidates). There's no question that his are HUGE compared to hers. That's all we need to know.
4 | Doug Larson | 6 | 10154782517804729_10154782851609729 | Trump is a man with a vision for America, not a specific vision, a great vision...the best vision...Trump has a plan to make this country great again....What plan??....a great plan...a plan that will work because it's the best plan.....Why???... because Trump knows good people...which people???....the best people....people that are not stupid like other people....people who know how to get deals done...what deals???...great deals...the biggest deals... because I know words... What words???...I have the best words... I get my information from watching TV... I consult with myself because I have a great brain... A great brain???...the best brain...Trump will also build a big wall to keep Mexicans out and he will make Mexico pay for it!...How....??? its all part of the great plan!...ISIS will be gone very, very quickly...How???... I won't tell you.. It's a secret !!!... (This guy is a “one-man circle jerk” and he is only about entertaining the uneducated who love him and his great plan. He's all air - no substance. And he is their “Champion”.)#NEVERTRUMPPlease feel free to share!

"Unsurprisingly, neither the Pentagon nor the Department of State made clear how providing well over a billion dollars in controversial munitions to a known funder and supporter of the Islamic State would assist in the effort to fight the Islamic State.However, it would additionally be worth pointing out that even before the ‘official’ formation of the ISIL, Saudi Arabia and Qatar had long-established records of egregious human rights abuses of apparent little consequence to the U.S. government and Hillary Clinton.Read more at http://thefreethoughtproject.com/clinton-us-govt-saudi-funding-isis/#bzVujH1XM9w7ClZV.99

Trump is for Law and Order and as he says Hillary should be in jail. Hillary is the one who "KNOWS" Putin, sold our uranium to Putin so Putin could in turn sell part to Iran, so they can make a bomb to kill us/our children/our grandchildren. Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of America. I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself. Hillary threatened Bill women who he molested/raped/attempted to molest on National TV, sent private detectives to dig up dirt on them and had them ALL audited by the IRS.

1 | Carolyn Peterson | 9 | 10154782406794729_10154782767874729 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks.

Oh yeah, by the way, the last Alaska poll had her up 3. Finally, the public saw the politicization of the FBI letter on full display while no new information was brought forth. Bad week?
4 | Elizabeth L Jones | 3 | 10154782406794729_10154782660489729 | Top Justice officials told Comey not to send the letter--but he went right ahead with the unethical choice to trash the Democratic candidate for President with innuendo, 11 days out from the election, for his own future career purposes... How ignominious and craven!

6 | Nikki Roberts Venter | 5 | 10154782406794729_10154782626994729 | And she has only herself to blame. She's been shielded for a long time by a media purposely turning a blind eye to the level of her corruption. The pot was bound to boil over.

23 | Hector Perez | 2 | 10154782406794729_10154782416449729 | It is absolutely obvious that the FBI has been infiltrated by an othe twisted conservative such  as it was the case with J. Edgar Hoover!!These kind of conservatives are absolutely twisted!!!J. Edgar HooverU.S. Federal GovernmentThe first director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation whose power base extended past presidential authority, J. Edgar Hoover was a racial conservative who considered many Civil Rights Movement activists to be dangerous subversives and Communist sympathizers.  Claiming that the FBI was "not a protection agency," Hoover had ordered agents to avoid intervening in civil rights crises and to limit their activities to observation and note-taking. In addition, he had ordered surveillance of several key figures in the movement, including Martin Luther King, Jr..  Hoover chose not to pass along intelligence received from Klansman and FBI operative Gary Thomas Rowe to Attorney General Robert Kennedy about the planned May 14 riot at the Birmingham Trailways Bus Terminal, giving the Kennedy administration no way to prevent the violence. At the May 20 riot at the Montgomery Greyhound Bus Station, Hoover's FBI agents stayed inside several parked vans taking pictures. The agents' film later turned out to be defective.  J. Edgar Hoover served as Director of the FBI for mare than 40 years, through the terms of 9 presidents.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=720098861335799&set=a.545188042160216.126306.100000070765022&type=3&theaterhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/freedomriders/people/j-edgar-hoover

We don't often know the signs of in-person voter fraud or vote rigging because we see the real thing so infrequently.

1 | Zack Goncz | 5 | 10154779433709729_10154779820994729 | Well, who needs journalists, poll workers, police, the FBI, the FEC, Attorney Generals, District Attorneys, US Attorneys, Judges, or even laws and the Constitution at all. Every Republican is Facebook Batman now.
2 | Cheryl Heymans | 3 | 10154779433709729_10154779876204729 | Election rigging is what happened during the Democratic primary.  Hundreds of thousands of voters purged, party affiliations swapped, voter suppression and rigging of actual machines. Funny how Hillary won every state where there were no paper trails and Bernie won most, maybe all, of those with paper trails. The vast collusion between Hillary, Google, FB, the DNC and the media guaranteed the corporate queen would win. They were responsible for the abysmal debate schedule,  the months' long major media (tv) blackout of Bernie,  continuing to include her super delegate count to give the appearance of her leading by a lot more than she was, Google hiding unfavorable stories, her paid media whores who continually attacked Bernie while writing pro-Hillary stories, and the vast voter suppression when the AP called her THE WINNER (not presumptive nominee) on the night before the Cali primary - when most of the delegates were up for grabs.  How many millions stayed home on Tuesday? If you can't see how this would sway an election, then you deserve Trump.It was rigged alright, by both Hillary's collusion and unprecedented numbers of election fraud.“The work we did to prepare for Hillary Clinton, to be our nominee and then make sure that we could get her elected president, is absolutely critical to advancing the issues that are important,” she said.

I am heartbroken that so many people would rather stay ignorant to the truth and blindly follow Hilary and not read ONE DAMN EMAIL that was leaked!!! How can you love America & continue to support a woman who has sold our country out?!? HOW?!? This election has uncovered a lot of truth & so have these LEAKED EMAILS:: TRUTH that Hilary broke the law by having a server & having TOP SECRET, CLASSIFIED Information on her server; which she used BleachBit to wipe clean (not with a cloth!); Hilary had 13 devices (not one for convenience like she lied about) & confessed to smashing them with a hammer; she told the FBI that she didn't remember what Classified meant; that Hilary will LIE TO YOUR FACE while you bury your child that she helped kill in Benghazi; Hilary hates Catholics, Gays, Arabs, Bernie Supporters & blacks (those super predators); Obama made sure the FBI didn't indite Hilary & emailed her knowing she had a private email account-(proving he also broke the law & KNEW she was breaking the law!); had Bill Clinton secretly meet with the DOJ Loretta Lynch on the airport Tarmac which was NOT about discussing grandchildren for over 30 minutes; the State department tried to BRIBE the FBI to Declassify some of Hilary's emails; the DNC rigged the system & stole the election from Bernie; tried to ruin Trump with sexual allegations that couldn't be denounced and proven false in time before the election- KNOWING that such allegations would be harmful even though they were NOT TRUE & that she tried to destroy the women who made sexual assault allegations about her husband; the democrat party has set up people to fight at Trump rallies and to incite violence & have PAID THEM TO DO SO; Dead Democrats are voting & George Soros (who OWNS Hilary) is linked to voting machines in 16 states that have major electoral college counts; Hilary & Bill have sold out our country for MILLIONS of dollars to Countries that SHE KNEW WERE FUNDING ISIS!!!! How in the hell can you support the continued corruption in our government?!? If Hilary wins there will be NOTHING nor No branch of government to stop her!!! She has already proven that!!! Please take off your Republican & Democrat hat & start thinking like an American!!!  Read the damn emails and stop swallowing the bullsh#t the democrat party, Hilary & the main stream media are shoveling down your throats!!! Think like an American  & pick back up those "principles" that you gave up to support the corruption of these "Political Parties"!!!

Trump is for Law and Order and as he says Hillary should be in jail. Hillary is the one who "KNOWS" Putin, sold our uranium to Putin so Putin could in turn sell part to Iran, so they can make a bomb to kill us/our children/our grandchildren. Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of Amercia. I remember when Obama and Romeny were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself. Hillary threatened Bill women who he molested/raped/attempted to molest on National TV, sent private detectives to dig up dirt on them and had them ALL audited by the IRS.

OK this is what's happening, So James Comey, FBI was investigating Carlos Danger aka Anthony Weiner, husband of Huma Aberdeen, right hand of Hillary Clinton, for sexting a 16 year old. They have had his laptop for several months, when one of his agent realized that he had memos from the President to Hillary on there from Hillary's secret server. So Comey got scared and realized, Oh $hit, this is going to be bad. So to cover his A$$, He reopened the Criminal Investigation on Hillary's Server. They have seen some of these emails, but there are many many more. And remember Hillary lied to the FBI, Congress, the Dept. of Justice and said she gave them everything and that there were no classified documents on the server and no more devises. So they have to get a Court Order to look deeper into the Laptop, But Loretta Lynch / Justice Dept. is not giving them one, not yet. who knows maybe never??? How is Lynch going to justify not doing so without looking guilty, there is no Tarmac to hide on! Also they asked Carlos Danger aka Weiner, how many people did you send nasty picture to? He said no MORE than 100 women. So this laptop may have been compromised, over and over and over. But it doesn't end there, the FBI Agents showed Huma Aberdeen an email from the President (which had his alias on it and she exclaimed, 'But why isn't marked classified?" That's called a smoking gun! Because it came thru Hillary's Privet Server, and the President knew, so he did not do the proper procedure on sending said memo. He was Complaisant!!! They should all go to jail! It will be interesting to see how Lynch is going to slither out of not giving a search warrant for that laptop!

It is impossible to know for certain what Trump has given to charity, because he has declined to release his tax returns. In all, The Post was able to identify $7.8 million in charitable giving from Trump’s own pocket since the early 1980s.

In public appearances, Trump often made it appear that he gave far more.

This Trump, who secretly was proven to have a sexsual relationship with Putin (a ruler of Russia, who made Trump crawl on the floor while whipping Trumps hairdue with a goosefeather all the while Trump begged for mercy and cried out loud. Trump campaigned in vane 'cause he wasn't sane. Trump also tried to bribe the FBI to make vague false claims. Trump lost the election to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who we all remember as the president, who made the U.S. great again (brought manufacturing jobs back to the US) and who was the president, who negotiated a lasting peace in the Middle East.

Trump is coming unglued! The man is insane. He brings the Tasmanian-Devil to mind, he acts and talks just like the cartoon character. Clinton isn’t perfect, but after the three debates, it’s very clear Trump doesn’t have the intelligence, or temperament to be President. Now add that Trump knows he's in trouble, so it's the Media, it’s the Clintons, it’s the Establishment, it's rigged polls, his shorts are too tight, it’s those women, it’s the rigged and corrupt system that's doing it to little Donny Trump. If the Democrats could rig elections why are the House and Senate in Republican control? If elections could be rigged, the GOP sure as hell wouldn’t have Trump as their nominee.

And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that’s where we are…Is it a certainty that we won’t learn before the election? I’m not sure it’s a certainty we won’t learn before the election.IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT BERNSTEIN  IS A HILLARY SUPPORTER BUT EVEN HE KNOWS THIS IS HUGE.

16 | Stacy Phillips | 0 | 10154779423529729_10154782017274729 | James Comey is a republican partisan, he could not stand his party hating him over not charging Hillary, it is so obvious he is trying to influence the election.
17 | Frances Scott | 0 | 10154779423529729_10154779934514729 | But one thing I will say about Comey is that he is going to continue fooling with ole Hillary and he is going to die in some strange car accident tomorrow or some other unknown means of suicide such as 5 bullets to the back of the head. Many have fooled with that corrupt skank and many have not lived to tell their story. If she becomes President she has plans to send a drone after Assange, you know!!!!
18 | Brian Bowen | 5 | 10154779423529729_10154779456489729 | 1.  Congressman Jason Chaffetz leads the Hillary Clinton email investigation and finds nothing.2.  FBI Director James Comey says he can't find anything to prosecute Hillary for, and catches HELL from majority of Republicans3. Donald J. Trump gets busted with his "Grab Them By The ... " tape.4.  Jason Chaffetz "un-endorses Donald Trump5.  Donald Trump begins ramping up his complaints about Hillary even being eligible to run for President.6. Jason Chaffetz suddenly "re-endorses" Donald Trump7. FBI Director James Comey sends his infamous letter today to ....you guessed it!  ....JASON CHAFFETZ.*(am I going too fast for y'all?)  :) So it looks to me like:A> the Republicans KNEW they were never going to defeat Hillary Clinton, and their ONLY hope was to get her imprisoned with some TRUMPed up charge.  B> The FBI Director was basically telling the #GOP that they would have to start a new witch hunt because the old one yielded nothing incriminating.  C> The polls start showing Hillary Clinton gaining more and more of the vote.  D> FBI Director begins to think about having to find another job, and in a desperate move, sends this letter to make it look like there was "SOMEthing" where there was actually "NOthing."(and they have the nerve to call Hillary "corrupt!")The solution?  VOTE BLUE up and down the ballot and kick ALL of these #GOP yahoos to the curb....and let Hillary get busy making America work for EVERYONE, beginning January 2017.November 8th can't get here fast enough!GRAB 'EM BY THE BALLots!

Comey's decision roiled the presidential race.

1 | Judith Saunders | 35 | 10154778987139729_10154779064104729 | Conclusion: he cared more about covering his own ass than he did our election. Oh yes, he is a republican, and he only told republicans. Maybe he saw a way he could influence the election
2 | Abbey Yussuf Jimoh | 31 | 10154778987139729_10154779037574729 | I dare say it, HRC is gonna WIN. I'm not an American, neither do I reside there. I'm rather smart enough to know that Comey is bowing to GOP's pressure to undermine Clinton's chances at the eleventh hour. I'm certain people are too. It won't fly.
3 | Paul Matthew | 11 | 10154778987139729_10154779080799729 | If there was any question as to where Comey's loyalty "lies", this has cleared it up: the Gutless Oppression Party. It certainly isn't with looking into the bribe that Conald Chump paid Pam Bondi to not investigate Chump U.
4 | Danielle Anderson | 12 | 10154778987139729_10154779093704729 | I am glad to see that there is some integrity left in the government and that Comey has enough left in him to do the right thing and his job. #staysafe
5 | Patricia Meisels | 4 | 10154778987139729_10154779209539729 | The time has come for Comey to bid his "adieu" and go on his way. He was pressured by the hijacked Republican Congress and he caved. He serves at the pleasure of the President, and he needs to hand in his resignation. I doubt that President Obama will ask for his resignation this close to the election, but, he should resign and hopefully HRC will win and can appoint a new head of the FBI. This man with all of his "integrity" that I have heard about damned day was surely lacking in this case.  #Disgusted
6 | James McHenry | 1 | 10154778987139729_10154780521479729 | He was a hero to you folks when he went on tv, laid out a case for indictment, and gave her a pass for stupidity. Unlike you nice people he has been paying attention to the daily release of the "lost" emails from Wikileaks. Another former hero of yours. Karma.....
7 | Tom Stowe | 4 | 10154778987139729_10154779144594729 | None of this would even be taken place had the one so many say is the most experienced to become POTUS, just followed policy, and not used a private server for government business. Right Madam Secretary?
8 | Dusty Meyers | 1 | 10154778987139729_10154780052104729 | Not really. The lines in the sand were already drawn. Maybe more clearly than in any other presidential race in modern history. In other words- Nobody gives a fuck about this. Those voting for HRC are still voting for her. Those voting for Trump are still voting for him. On November 9th we'll all wake up to the same country with the same problems. Congress will either stop fucking around and do something about it or they won't. Shit will still be shit.
9 | Charlie Kraebel | 7 | 10154778987139729_10154779088149729 | Has anyone stopped to think there is no way Comey and the FBI would move forward with this without the OK from the Justice Department? Especially considering Lynch's interference in the July decision?People need to take off the partisan blinders and look at this objectively.
10 | Carl Jackson | 1 | 10154778987139729_10154780558729729 | They don't have to update a damn thing they are the FBI that is Hillary Clinton behind pushing for a update she wants to get away with this same thing that her husband did back in 1980s is the big deal with China she wants the big bonus pack $500 million that is why she is fighting and more money from the Saudi Arabia and Wall Street in New York City ladies and gentlemen it is all about money with the Clintons
11 | Jack Reed | 0 | 10154778987139729_10154780897404729 | I would guess he contacted the congressional committee because he realized that the DOJ would have tried to prevent him from reopening the case. I have no doubt that the DOJ made threats to him during the prior investigation. Now he has secured some protection to execute justise without interference.

The #GOP and #Trump would be wise to contemplate a valuable life lesson that Dorothy Rodham taught her daughter. When Hillary was faced with ill spirited adversity, Dorothy presented a simple building tool, a level, for Hillary to gage the conscious balance of her actions. Hillary learned adept constructs of the architecture of human nature and vicariously, good judgement. Misfortunately,Trump's father encouraged the brutality of his son's killer instinct, as a centric life lesson. The whole political environment is suffering in the throes of Trump's brutality! *Our country has never been in greater need of feminine wisdom and leadership! #HillaryClinton welcomes and respects Republican values. While GOP leaders are succumbing to Trumpian brutality, the country is being ripped at the seams that bind us. The fate of our nation is precariously dangling on the capacity of The Republican Party to acknowledge the wisdom of Dorothy Rodham's lesson. Ironically, in time, Trump's tower of brutality will fall because the impetus of human survival is stronger. Please lean a tad to the left Republicans, find your balance and reunite us against hostile Russian aggression!  <3 #StrongerTogether
13 | Mana Olana | 1 | 10154778987139729_10154779349439729 | One of the latest strings from the Podesta emails reveals a deeply troubling level of intolerance. The following is an exchange that occurred upon the death of SCOTUS Chief Justice Scalia. I am alarmed by the telling hatred displayed by those who would have us believe them to be open-mind, unbiased, and tolerant of other points of view.  These comments should be especially troubling for potential parents of future students expecting a Jesuit education.On Feb 13, 2016, at 5:30 PM, Milton Regan <regan@law.georgetown.edu  wrote: Justice Scalia passed away today during a visit to Texas.Mitt Regan Georgetown Law Center 600 New Jersey Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20001 Phone: 202-662-9414  On Feb 13, 2016, at 6:35 PM, William M.

I cringed at headline and at the unmitigated praise with which the press release described a jurist whose intellectual positions were not brilliant but simplistic and formalistic.  He was not a legal figure to be lionized or emulated by our students. He openly sided with the party of intolerance in the "culture wars" he often invoked. In my mind, he was not a "giant" in any sense. I don't want to teach our students to hold Scalia in reverence. The "Georgetown Community" is a lived community of tolerance, affection, and care that so many have built for so long here. That "community" would never have claimed that it mourns the loss of J. Scalia. Sincerely, Gary From: Michael Gottesman Sent: Monday, February 15, 2016Subject: RE: Justice Scalia Whatever one thinks of his jurisprudence, Scalia was an extraordinarily significant figure. I never doubted his "brilliance." It would be a sad day if, as an institution, we were incapable of honoring important public figures upon their death simply because we disagree with the positions they took. Our public face as an institution of scholars should suggest that we're open-minded and receptive to all views, even if it's not true.

17 | Aftab Mirza | 3 | 10154778987139729_10154779076469729 | DESPITE HER SHORTCOMINGS, HILLARY CLINTON IS STILL THE BEST CHOICE AMERICA HAS::Despite the fact that Hillary Clinton's past is ridden with scandals, both of spurious and serious nature, she stands out as the best choice America has under the circumstances. Regardless of how worse a presidential candidate she might be, Americans just cannot afford to elect Donald Trump as the next President of the United States. Considering his explosive temperament, lack of knowledge on national and International affairs, his coarse and vulgar behavior, his penchant for autocracy and his affinity toward dictators, Americans should show their outright rejection of him at the ballot box on November 8. He is the most unqualified and worst ever presidential candidate America has ever produced. He is dangerous, unfit and most unworthy a candidate to be considered for the highest office in the land. His election will not only spell disaster for the U.S. but the entire world as a whole. In view of the above, America must elect Hillary Clinton as the next President of the Unites States if they have the best interest of their own country and the interest of the International peace and stability upper most on their minds.
18 | Peter Siskos | 1 | 10154778987139729_10154780117214729 | Hmmm: so new information came in and he decided to reopen the investigation. Seems normal and transparent to me. I was under the impression that the FBI is suppose to act irrespective of what is going on politically. Was he suppose to wait until after the election to do so? Why on earth would he do that?

How can you love America & continue to support a woman who has sold our country out?!? HOW?!? This election has uncovered a lot of truth & so have these LEAKED EMAILS:: TRUTH that Hilary broke the law by having a server & having TOP SECRET, CLASSIFIED Information on her server; which she used BleachBit to wipe clean (not with a cloth!); Hilary had 13 devices (not one for convenience like she lied about) & confessed to smashing them with a hammer; she told the FBI that she didn't remember what Classified meant; that Hilary will LIE TO YOUR FACE while you bury your child that she helped kill in Benghazi; Hilary hates Catholics, Gays, Arabs, Bernie Supporters & blacks (those super predators); Obama made sure the FBI didn't indite Hilary & emailed her knowing she had a private email account-(proving he also broke the law & KNEW she was breaking the law!); had Bill Clinton secretly meet with the DOJ Loretta Lynch on the airport Tarmac which was NOT about discussing grandchildren for over 30 minutes; the State department tried to BRIBE the FBI to Declassify some of Hilary's emails; the DNC rigged the system & stole the election from Bernie; tried to ruin Trump with sexual allegations that couldn't be denounced and proven false in time before the election- KNOWING that such allegations would be harmful even though they were NOT TRUE & that she tried to destroy the women who made sexual assault allegations about her husband; the democrat party has set up people to fight at Trump rallies and to incite violence & have PAID THEM TO DO SO; Dead Democrats are voting & George Soros (who OWNS Hilary) is linked to voting machines in 16 states that have major electoral college counts; Hilary & Bill have sold out our country for MILLIONS of dollars to Countries that SHE KNEW WERE FUNDING ISIS!!!! How in the hell can you support the continued corruption in our government?!? If Hilary wins there will be NOTHING nor No branch of government to stop her!!! She has already proven that!!! Please take off your Republican & Democrat hat & start thinking like an American!!!  Read the damn emails and stop swallowing the bullsh#t the democrat party, Hilary & the main stream media are shoveling down your throats!!! Think like an American  & pick back up those "principles" that you gave up to support the corruption of these "Political Parties"!!!
