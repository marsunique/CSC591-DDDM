Donald Trump has promised to curb crime through stronger "law and order" initiatives, while Hillary Clinton has addressed issues of racial bias and over-incarceration.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Joseph Bilby | 10154679067488675_10154680886758675 | Actually the core problem is poverty and lack of opportunity. Neither one brought that up, because that is far more complicated than tossing out slogans.
2 | Keishelle Achong | 10154679067488675_10154680902978675 | Interesting since The rest of the world don't have to worry. The whole world knows, Trump hasn't contributed any taxes for border security, for our US Military to fight and protect our country and embassies and etc. But, I bet other US citizens did! Trump and his followers, "Let's make [Russia] great again!" How American? Lol hypocrites
3 | Jeannie Marshall | 10154679067488675_10154680949733675 | One of the candidate didn't answer the "Play for play" question! Anyone would wonder:
4 | Stephany Hall Williams | 10154679067488675_10154680952833675 | Yes, both like to talk about illegal guns and yet neither take the step to hold law enforcement responsibible for the eradication of guns in their city or State!  Or how abou the role of the ATF?  Laws can't do anything without manpower behind them. Why is it that local and State police would rather harass black men and make small time pot busts instead of applying their skills to discovering and taking action to confiscated illegal weapons?  That's real police work. Taking weapons from criminals b4 they kill people with them.
5 | Lauren Kathryn | 10154679067488675_10154680975248675 | 1/4 of the worlds incarcerated population is behind bars in America and he thinks you need 'stronger' law and order.  How about smarter? Or fairer? America is already great at locking people up.  Try keeping them out of jail.
6 | Macky Cosmos | 10154679067488675_10154680981728675 | End mass incarceration, end the failed war on drugs.

10 | Sharee Johnson-Cammon | 10154679067488675_10154680899493675 | Trump is strong on his 13th Amendment | Dog whistling game.
11 | John Northerner | 10154679067488675_10154680955303675 | Over 2,000 Americans are arrested every day for using marijuana.  It accounts for over half of all drug arrests.  These candidates want to give us more laws and more orders but less freedom.  There's only one candidate who has a vision for a brighter and better America and she wasn't allowed into the debate.  We have 25% of the worlds imprisoned people and only 4% of the worlds population.  We spend more on incarceration than we do on education.  The reason Jill Stein wasn't allowed in the debates is because the main stream media can't handle the truth.  Don't waste your vote on a party that has thrown you under the bus.  Join me in voting for Doctor Jill Stein.
12 | Hal Briggs | 10154679067488675_10154680878768675 | Trump was right.  Hillary would be 4 more years of 0bama.  How has that worked out for us?

The videos targeting Democrats are from a conservative group famous and infamous for undercover work.

1 | Christine Turner | 10154679186243675_10154680655563675 | Why does anyone think it is within their right to go to another's event and protest? I have never understood the mind set of expressing one's political opinion by interfering while someone else is expressing theirs. It is the antithesis of free speech.
2 | Adam Tarver | 10154679186243675_10154680675728675 | This guy has been caught making phony videos numerous times and the same people buy into it every time. You guys would be a savior to a used car salesman..
3 | Ian Auld | 10154679186243675_10154680648743675 | James O'Keefe is NEVER a valid source and causes trouble to fit his agenda. People like him are desperate to the point that they are committing suicide.
4 | Ken Bradley | 10154679186243675_10154680755918675 | I watched the debate. When pressed on the issue of inciting violence, Clinton displayed some pretty telling body language right before she redirected to another topic without ever responding to the issue. She, and her team resorted to violence in attempting to destroy her opponent and every mannerism suggested she knew it. Not only is that wrong, thats a crime!
5 | Bruce Terry | 10154679186243675_10154680750168675 | The Watergate scandal was about illegal access to the Democratic National Committee's offices in Watergate - cyber espionage is sometimes considered to source information in the national interest, but spreading disinformation is harmful to the democratic process.
6 | Thomas Corbi | 10154679186243675_10154680944073675 | If elections are rigged due to voter fraud and media bias, why (how) is it that the GOP holds the Congress, the Senate, and the majority of State governorships?? What evil cabal has altered the election mechanics so dramatically in the past 2 years? 4 years?? If Trump disavows the 2016 election outcome, are all the State, Congress, Senate, and initiative results also suspect? WOW!!
7 | Bruce Mccoy | 10154679186243675_10154680691083675 | Embarrassing for HRC machine. Not unlike CREEP and Nixon's dirty tricks, for which Donald Segretti went to jail. This case, business as usual, no prosecution. 'Might makes right', 'the end justifies the means' philosophy of  a tyrant.
8 | Hal Briggs | 10154679186243675_10154680758998675 | This election is very upsetting. The people must choose between a criminal with a string of dead bodies behind her or someone who said mean things.
9 | Bernadette Mathews | 10154679186243675_10154680873343675 | This is by saying filmmaker who gave us the lies about Planned Parenthood. They edit tapes so that what a person says isn't what they said at the time it was taped. It is more lying from a candidacy that is nothing but lies
10 | Don Tartasky | 10154679186243675_10154680778538675 | Who did Dick Tuck and Lee Atwater work for and what mischief were they responsible for?Dirty tricks in politics have a long history and no party is innocent.Any "reporting" by O'Keefe and associates has to be viewed with skepticism.
11 | Lisa Hickenbottom | 10154679186243675_10154680974193675 | Okay, so...we're supposed to believe that enough people would KNOW they're being mobilized to AFFECT an election...yet NONE of the alleged people say anything?? And we're also supposed believe that people volunteered to get punched in the face? Wow. Don't buy this AT all.
12 | Glenn Hilby | 10154679186243675_10154680778993675 | So, PBS is doing a report on a report group that exposes an action of a campaign?Good thing it wasn't a republican campaign doing this. The headlines would be totally different.
13 | Jack Greer | 10154679186243675_10154680958823675 | Yeah, us Democrats are real sneaky.  We like to assassinate character, lie about and fling innuendo's about like they were confetti.  We call ourselves "Christian" but then we really have nothing to do with the teachings of Christ.  We nominate a man to run for President that is a bigot, a racist and liar!  Yeah, we baaaaaaaaad!
14 | Harry Childers | 10154679186243675_10154680947318675 | Hmmm   So Republican political operatives are saints and Jack Armstrongs who play clean? HahahahahaEven without release of full transcripts or unedited video, the Dems immediately fired the guys that were targeted. Would the Trump folks (I really can't call them "Republicans" - they've hijacked the party, in my opinion) have done that? Probably not.
15 | John Barry | 10154679186243675_10154680919073675 | The outlet has pre-destroyed its own credibility by previous heavy editing to produce misleading information.  These are the people who would take someone saying, "I oppose voting rights for corporations", and report it as them saying "I oppose voting rights".  The integrity of the reporter is 100% absent.
16 | Chuck Anthony Brulet | 10154679186243675_10154680717558675 | This election is corrupt & rigged, the bias media is disgusting with the lies & propaganda on Hear Say on Trump when we have proof of Hillary's corruption
17 | Edward Holmes | 10154679186243675_10154680844393675 | George Soros who has been funding Hillary Clinton's campaign with millions of dollars, It turn out that he has deep ties with a company providing voting machines in 16 States with 5 of them being swing States, furthering the rigging of an American election.... http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/18/soros-connected-company-provides-voting-machines-in-16-states
18 | Michael Murley | 10154679186243675_10154680890408675 | How the hell can you call it "alleging" when it is absolute proof? I alledge you (PBS) have become a propaganda arm of a total corrupt and enemy infiltrated federal government. And if exposing the sale of chopped baby parts makes a journalist "infamous" we are living in upside down world you disgusting hacks.
19 | Chris Martens | 10154679186243675_10154680894533675 | We also know that Creamer has visited the Obama White House, and met with Obama, literally hundreds of times. He's not some fringe character. He's one of their top dirty operators.

21 | Jodi Graves | 10154679186243675_10154680855178675 | I voted HillaryHere's whyI do like herWith her in office Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders actually have a voice, even if it's against her. What we need more than anything is a congress and senate that represent the people not corporations.  The republicans of today will even sell their souls for greed and guns.  This is not what the true Republican Party was about  I actually voted a split ticket before but this time it was all blue.
22 | Marc Carr | 10154679186243675_10154680862073675 | What was missing in the beginning of this report was any attempt to show how truthful or authentic these are.   It was stated in the report that the guy behind this report was behind other disproven stories and was left at that.  So I do question the decision to report this if it's voracity is questionable.
23 | Justin Prochnow | 10154679186243675_10154680861738675 | So what now? We gonna whine and cry about Corruption being exploited now? What so we want to protect criminals like Hillary and these democrats? Wow talk about Stockholm Syndrome. "oh I love it when Democrats screw me over and take my money and ruin my kids futures" Wow you Hillary supporters are really retarded
24 | Jay Smith | 10154679186243675_10154680839823675 | Hillarys body language and facial expressions said it all. She is exposed for what she really is, a lying, cheating, corrupt elected official. The Democrats unethical and treasonous dirty tricks are inexcusable.
25 | Charles Gardner | 10154679186243675_10154680697588675 | Hillary has lied, stole, cheated....shouldn't be on stage❌❌❌Hillary is a lying untrustworthy crook...and already lost❌❌❌

Has Julian Assange overstayed his welcome at the Ecuadorian embassy?

2 | Nancy Martin | 10154679184758675_10154680850743675 | I read an article and I can't find the link so you can take this however you want but there was some indication he was involved in a online conversation with a minor. I am not saying it's true just that there might be more to this than what is on the surface. I will continue to look for the link.
3 | Jonny Corn | 10154679184758675_10154680526208675 | no, he hasn't overstayed his welcome. but it's time service providers respect their flaws too. the will of a nation is the will of a nation. it's time for a celebrity deathmatch. how about assange vs google and russia with the aluminum chair. then n korea taps in to F@ck verizon

7 | Chuck Anthony Brulet | 10154679184758675_10154680886673675 | A push by the establishment, to stop a leak that America's first black president is corrupt, and involved in a scandal, worse the Watergate, Don't want to tarnish the image of our first black president
8 | Scott Tucker | 10154679184758675_10154680601848675 | Pressure from our government, I imagine. I'm sure we send them money in some form or another, so Obama applied pressure to silence Assange in order to help Killary.
9 | Marc Elacqua | 10154679184758675_10154680506283675 | You know what would be funny is if they cut off the shower, you know he stinks anyway. Predator.
10 | William Richardson | 10154679184758675_10154680708383675 | That means reporters will have to work for a living instead of relaying on Assange to do their job.
11 | Patricia Ann | 10154679184758675_10154680580063675 | If our government wanted to stop him..it is pretty stupid to do it now..if you think they did it to help Hillary. The damage is done. So maybe it has to do with him tampering with the election itself. That is dangerous. He very well could be now working for  Russia. He had an agenda..he does not like her. It was not about freedom. He did play a major role in going into the dnc private thinking. Why did he not go into trumps 2003 windows? Find his taxes? His foundation monies used for his family? The rnc personal comments?

24 | Daphney Waggoner | 10154679184758675_10154680569118675 | It's interesting to me how in 2010, Julian Assange was perceived as a traitor of the highest order for being the platform that distributed Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning's stolen classified materials.  Now Julian Assange (the accused but not convicted sex offender) is being heralded as some sort of hero, while blatantly interfering in our Country's election.  Like Marco Rubio said, this isn't a cause we should be celebrating, today it's Democrats, tomorrow it could be the GOP.  And if Assange is celebrated for what he's doing, then perhaps we should take another look at Chelsea Manning's 35 year conviction for treason....Just putting that out there.

The Republican National Committee's chief strategist said the national party would "respect the will of the people."

"I cannot speak for what he thinks," Sean Spicer said of Trump.

2 | Robert Show | 10154680114008675_10154680202463675 | Don`t blame him either, video shows that the system is rigged and people caught tearing up ballots, it`s all over Facebook and on local news.
3 | Michele A Wilcox | 10154680114008675_10154680163348675 | lmfao when Trump made the statement about 9-month abortions. What an idiot!
4 | Kenneth Geyer | 10154680114008675_10154680221043675 | Why would anyone agree to respect the results of cheating.Gore did, look how that turned out. More recently Sanders did as well. Voter suppression and election fraud invalidates the results, otherwise the best cheater wins.#Green2016
5 | Jason Downs | 10154680114008675_10154680286603675 | They were proven to have manipulated the primaries & he's being judged for being leery of the election? I have more respect for that than "toeing the line." Sounded more like they were asking him to please don't bring much attention to it when you lose.

7 | Joan Gibala | 10154680114008675_10154680882733675 | All Republican politicians and leadership -- beginning with  Ryan and Priebus and O'Connell -- need to go before cameras today to clearly state that s/he will, without question, honor the election results.
8 | Delores Sylvester | 10154680114008675_10154680946643675 | On our last election night, republican pundits seemed absolutely shocked that Romney lost - they thought he was ahead. Now, we have the republicans coming out weeks ahead of the election claiming that trump has won every debate and that he is definitely winning the election. The media is in collusion with the 'elites' in rigging the election process, and also saying that there are millions of votes that will be illigally cast against Trump. The democrats will be bussing thousands of senior citizens around the country on Election Day to take your dead relatives place at the voting booths. Of course, he is not going to accept the results if Clinton wins. They have cast doubt about any election result for years to come. Unless, they win. Maybe Putin can help him out.
9 | Dave Severson | 10154680114008675_10154680853318675 | Trump and his supporters now say that anything they don't agree with or anything that doesn't endorse Trump is "rigged".  lol, sorry, nothing is rigged, Trump and his supporters are just wrong about most things concerning how the government runs, and how the world works.
10 | Mark Scanlan | 10154680114008675_10154680637693675 | I feel like Bernie could have incited national chaos if he wanted to after the DNC rigging was leaked, but instead he conceded. I can't imagine Trump would do the same in that scenario.
11 | Julia Harris | 10154680114008675_10154680845768675 | Bring out the emails! Bring out the emails! Bring out the emails!!  And for those of you that are privileged to vote this year , take the time and remember the soldiers who lost their lives in Benghazi because they won't be able to vote this year because of her.
12 | Emerald Chavez | 10154680114008675_10154680377663675 | if there is fraud in this election only the Supreme Court will be able to decide that mr. Trump will be president. Nice try lying twisted biased media PBS.
13 | Timothy Vandyk | 10154680114008675_10154680876828675 | The message was clear last night. If you are hoping for a weakening of the status and respect of the United States on the world stage, and a continued assault on the Constitution of this great country, you’ll get what you wish for with Hillary.
14 | Karen Elizabeth Hunt-Maddry | 10154680114008675_10154680781963675 | He did not say he would refuse to accept election results. He said we will wait and see. Who can blame him. We have dead people and illegals voting, voter fraud, ballots being destroyed by postal workers, Trump headquarters being firebombed. He's entitled to say, we will wait and see.
15 | Edward Holmes | 10154680114008675_10154680844953675 | George Soros who has been funding Hillary Clinton's campaign with millions of dollars, It turn out that he has deep ties with a company providing voting machines in 16 States with 5 of them being swing States, furthering the rigging of an American election.... http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/18/soros-connected-company-provides-voting-machines-in-16-states
16 | Bob Cox | 10154680114008675_10154680629928675 | Again the national media needs a history lesson.  Al Gore said he'd accept the results of the election. After being named the loser, Al Gore changed his mind and demanded a recount.  After he lost the recount he still would not accept the result announced the morning after the election. Next he sued and eventually the Supreme Court had to decide the election was won by George W Bush. Even then, Al Gore did not accept the results by claiming voter fraud.  Now when Trump is honest and says he will wait until Election Day to decide if he will accept the results on election night, the media and Democrats are making a big deal out of it.  That honest Trump answer is not going to undermine our republic. The fact he was honest is a good thing because we all know Hillary is never honest.

18 | Hal Briggs | 10154680114008675_10154680767043675 | This election is very upsetting. The people must choose between a criminal with a string of dead bodies behind her or someone who said mean things.

20 | Yoko Sugata | 10154680114008675_10154680494763675 | Trump is a man child who has no idea what the hell he's talking about. Big fail. I was tortured for 90 minutes listening to his ramblings and every time I wanted to throw up, Hillary brought me back to the world of intelligence. Big win for Hillary last night and all the other debates.
21 | Tim Brooks | 10154680114008675_10154680310203675 | Does anyone notice, the media only has attention for him not accepting the results? But no concerns for the actual cheating?
22 | Patricia Ann | 10154680114008675_10154680440353675 | You know..I can't watch..so I read the transcript. It is like a horror movies with no sound. I was a teacher..it reads like like 3rd grade essays. It is scary to think a man who is running for president speaks like this. Now, they have him on a world stage, on Fox, against the freedom of voting..and if continues to incite violence ..hinder the voting process..they can go after him now!

Roe v. Wade is the landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing abortions, something that conservatives have fought for four decades.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Phyllis Nelson | 10154679875893675_10154680285553675 | I think it is past time to quit using the identifier "pro-life."  It has been challenged sufficiently, these individuals are anti-abortion, not pro-life as evidenced by all manner of anti-child & anti-family policies supported by the right.
2 | Ryan Sharp | 10154679875893675_10154680082023675 | His running mate is also against abortions.  Funny how there is a video awhile back on Trump saying he hates the idea of abortion, but is very pro choice.  Quite the flip flop to get voters.
3 | Renée Gauthier | 10154679875893675_10154680169583675 | Ten bucks says he's paid for a few abortions in his time. Maybe more than a few.
4 | Shari Rose | 10154679875893675_10154680157623675 | If conservatives have fought it for four decades, how did they accomplish nothing substantive to that end between 2003-2007, when conservatives held power in the legislative and executive branches with a majority on the Supreme Court?
5 | Randy Cromwell | 10154679875893675_10154680086568675 | Who in the world really thinks Trump is pro life?
6 | Jeremy Broadway | 10154679875893675_10154680549348675 | When roe vs wade was decided 6 of the 9 justices that approved it was republican republicans are the reason it's there in the first place..we have had republicans majority in the house and in the senate with republican presidents in the past roe vs wade will never be overturned it's just a way to string along uneducated voters to vote for a certain party. I think roe vs wade should be overturned on the basis of it's a states right though
7 | Alison Swihart | 10154679875893675_10154680385968675 | I am against roe v wade but I don't expect it will be overturned. Realistically the only way to end abortion is for people to begin to value life.
8 | Mike Gaun | 10154679875893675_10154680234453675 | Instead of reporting on Hillary's statement that she supports late term partial birth abortion they focus on whether he said he supports roe v wade being overturned?   He made it very clear the SC Judges he would appoint would have as a goal overturning roe v wade.   This liberal media 0nly focuses on one candidate.
9 | Jack Perry | 10154679875893675_10154680095523675 | The entire campaign season has only been "nasty" because Trump was part of it. What a complete douchenozzle he is.
10 | Ashley Lee | 10154679875893675_10154680139328675 | This is exactly what I thought, I was expecting a better response. Clinton seemed more passionate about her answer than Trump sounded about his! So frustrating 😤! Gee If only we had a candidate who could have hung HRC out to dry on that question.....oh wait we had 16 choices to begin with
11 | Jessica Jerdee | 10154679875893675_10154680974643675 | No doctor or government deserves the right to tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her body I am sorry.  If it comes down to the life of the mother or the baby a woman has to choose for herself what to do.
12 | Larry Shea | 10154679875893675_10154680194383675 | I would love to know how many abortions he has paid for from his many affairs!!!
13 | Paul Jackson | 10154679875893675_10154680946318675 | He's got several issues that he is standing in the middle of. Another one is the status of illegal immigrants. Whether or not he wants to deport them depends on who he is talking to. Another is his Middle East strategy. He evaded Wallace's question on whether or not he wants to send troops. He tells us that the era of nation building will be over, yet he wants to "take the oil" which requires an occupation.
14 | Michele A Wilcox | 10154679875893675_10154680167413675 | LMFAO when Trump made the statement about 9-month abortions. What an idiot!
15 | Yoko Sugata | 10154679875893675_10154680553838675 | Trump is a man child who has no idea what the hell he's talking about. Big fail.

Big win for Hillary last night and all the other debates.
16 | Christopher Keene | 10154679875893675_10154680220218675 | Strange how the loss of new life matters more than the loss of older life in wars to these right to life people.
17 | Gary Burkhart | 10154679875893675_10154680194233675 | Maybe it would be better to cut a man's dick off so he can always have control and get the ladies off the hook!
18 | Mark Devenney | 10154679875893675_10154680086153675 | 
19 | Lola Chapin | 10154679875893675_10154680925543675 | Gee, I wonder how many abortions The Donald has paid for over the years?
20 | Lisa Jackson | 10154679875893675_10154680328208675 | Love it when pro-lifers are pro death penalty.... Just saying lmao!
21 | John Maniz | 10154679875893675_10154680814343675 | First he's not a conservative. If you think it is ok to have an abortion after 16 weeks you are a murderer.
22 | Marie Gonda | 10154679875893675_10154680646093675 | He was giving his personal opinion on abortion. Even if he becomes.es president he will not be able to change that constitutional right. Much like gun laws
23 | Bonnie J. Williams | 10154679875893675_10154680572393675 | Pros and cons! Many issues on both sides, each side has good and bad
24 | Paul Floyd | 10154679875893675_10154680102018675 | a country with 2000 nukes should not base its leader on this issue! I am personally against abortion but there are instances where its needed. Not for birth control. But complications. Stop with this debate! Its like proving God exists . No resolution.
25 | Felix Lau | 10154679875893675_10154680197383675 | ATTENTION: GOP SENATORS WANT TRUMP to choose our next Supreme Court nominee. We can't let that happen.

"I will tell you at the time," Donald Trump said on whether he'll accept the results of the presidential election. "I'll keep you in suspense."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | John Maniz | 10154679877353675_10154680725943675 | With all the corrupt crap going on with the DNC why should he?? All he said was I'll wait and as long as there is nothing corrupt. Have you paid attention on the recent scandals?? Seems everyone just follows the corrupt press and their leftist agenda!!!#WAKE UP!!!
2 | Christine Marie | 10154679877353675_10154680031183675 | People often conflate election fraud and voter fraud. They are very different. Voter fraud, which Republicans tend to be afraid of, is when individual voters vote twice, or misstate their citizenship and vote, etc. It would take very large numbers of such voters to affect any election that wasn't extremely close. Election fraud, on the other hand, affects votes at a wholesale level, and can easily affect outcomes.  http://trustvote.org/voting-systems/electronic-voting-vulnerabilities/    http://electionjustice.net
3 | TJ Neuharth | 10154679877353675_10154680383993675 | Trump proves again he has no class or understanding of American tradition. This carnival barking slum lord should be locked away for everyone's safety.
4 | Thomas Corbi | 10154679877353675_10154680918103675 | If elections are rigged due to voter fraud and media bias, why (how) is it that the GOP holds the Congress, the Senate, and the majority of State governorships?? What evil cabal has altered the election mechanics so dramatically in the past 2 years? 4 years?? If Trump disavows the 2016 election outcome, are all the State, Congress, Senate, and initiative results also suspect? WOW!!
5 | Steve Szilard | 10154679877353675_10154680980953675 | This statement shows a fundamental lack of respect for the United States of America, and the institutions of democracy. For an individual who claims to want to make America Great, the demonstration that he is willing to ruin the country to get his way is the best evidence that he has only his own interests in mind, and that his ego trumps all.
6 | Kathy Halvorsen | 10154679877353675_10154680876593675 | Cause his context for the presidency is his reality show. Keep em in suspense, folks and get them through the next ads. Maybe Ivanka should gently inform him this isn't a Kardashian show. Quite possibly he doesn't realize this.
7 | Jen Bradley | 10154679877353675_10154680113328675 | I believe that Donald J. Trump's last answer reflects on the possibility, that if he becomes President, Hillary will go to jail, like she should.
8 | Polikarp Kojin | 10154679877353675_10154680204993675 | Our news in America is so corupt and biased. It makes me to never trust my neighbors or our citizen's. They're are idiots. You read there comments. You wonder if you should abandon this country.
9 | Matthew Ledvina | 10154679877353675_10154680249023675 | I think trump made great points in his weird way. I'm a lifelong democrat and when he pressed her on giving back money from nations who oppress women she prevaricated. I do not like this woman.
10 | Benjamin Freeman | 10154679877353675_10154680819278675 | Al Gore refused election results and even took it to the supreme court, remember "hanging Chads" I stand with Trump. Never concede anything until the last vote is counted!

12 | Rodney Bowerson | 10154679877353675_10154680053738675 | Again! He said wait and see. Let's keep it honest. I'm a life long fan of PBS, and consider myself to be liberal. This headline is why so many are calling most of the media anti Trump. We all hold PBS TO A HIGHER STANDARD
13 | Juan Manuel Pinalez | 10154679877353675_10154680071223675 | Hillary was just asked on her plane if she would concede if he wins and Hillary pivots, dodged and dances by going on and on about Trump and how much of a sore loser he is and how old the country is and how all others have accepted defeat.She failed to answer the question asked.

16 | Selena Hancock | 10154679877353675_10154680034803675 | Read this folks - "Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071. For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.

It was neither the best of debates, nor the worst of debates. But it may have been the most fascinating of this campaign between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jack Perry | 10154679943003675_10154679964108675 | I'm not saying that Donald Trump rambled like a punchdrunk idiot on crack in all 3 debates but...wait, that's EXACTLY what he did.
2 | Macky Cosmos | 10154679943003675_10154679952123675 | Clearly the vile predator and Russian sympathizer/draft dodger lost this important debate and further proved his incompetence by refusing to acknowledge defeat should it come. I am truly feeling blessed to be alive and witnessing a woman ascend to the presidency as the gravity of this great accomplishment is immeasurably beautiful and not to mention, it is about time. #ImWithHer #HillaryClinton
3 | Scotty Jones Cherryholmes | 10154679943003675_10154679977688675 | "TOAST" — Truly the only thing that is really shocking is there are people so callow they have convinced themselves Trump represents their best interests. He has no plans. He has no ideas. All he is ever saying is "believe me." Everything is all about himself. He can't even construct a sentence. All hyperbole.
4 | Jayne Mead | 10154679943003675_10154680053038675 | Their differences were glaring. He sounded like a 5th grader, repeating words, repeating phrases, especially when he wasn't too knowledgeable on the constitution, for example. She was great, articulate & smart. And most of all, he was a Very nasty man. After all when all else fails, go way down low, show em u r pissed. This last debate made me more anxious at the thought of a trump presidency, even though I predict he'll lose n throw abig ugly tantrum.
5 | Nancy Mac | 10154679943003675_10154679982198675 | Ummmm...fascinating is not at all an adjective that even remotely describes what went on tonight. And it was anything but a debate. Actually it was more like her acceptance speech. At this point the world is laughing at Trump which is as it should be. That said, looking forward to watch Sanders in congress actually accomplish great things.
6 | Nolan Soyer Pan | 10154679943003675_10154680006093675 | Everyone, debate victory is not enough. It is voter turnout, so please come out and VOTE for Hillary.
7 | Kimberly Neall Bloomer | 10154679943003675_10154680030583675 | I truly believe that the "change" that his supporters want to see in our government accompanied by his blatant disrespect for our constitution, all current and former Presidents, and everything representing democracy or the democratic process makes them all want a dictatorship like China. Maybe they should defect to a government that better reflects their governmental requirements.
8 | Linda Medley | 10154679943003675_10154679961143675 | My home town..... At one time, Flint MI had one of the highest per capita income rates of anywhere in the US. Once NAFTA was enacted, and GM left for Mexico, Flint became a Ghost Town, and now is the 2nd poorest city in the country.
9 | Rose Marie | 10154679943003675_10154680073678675 | What's fascinating is that people don't see a problem with the entity behind these debates that is supposed to be a non profit and non partisan yet is controlled by the two parties.
10 | Karen Tesar | 10154679943003675_10154680449633675 | There was nothing 'Presidential' about Trump... To call it a Presidential Debate gives it more dignity - and him 100% more gravitas than he either demonstrates or deserves.
11 | Thomas Corbi | 10154679943003675_10154680861298675 | If elections are rigged due to voter fraud and media bias, why (how) is it that the GOP holds the Congress, the Senate, and the majority of State governorships??

13 | Edward Holmes | 10154679943003675_10154680845823675 | George Soros who has been funding Hillary Clinton's campaign with millions of dollars, It turn out that he has deep ties with a company providing voting machines in 16 States with 5 of them being swing States, furthering the rigging of an American election.... http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/18/soros-connected-company-provides-voting-machines-in-16-states
14 | Janette Reget | 10154679943003675_10154680881568675 | His party and campaign MUST tell him that if he loses the election, it's because the voters didn't want him, not because the voting is rigged. OMG. He will never accept that he could be a loser--always finds something or someone else to blame.
15 | Shannon Martin | 10154679943003675_10154679959868675 | ...take awayHillary took $225k from a Brazillian bank and promised to dissolve American sovereignty - and that that is all Russia's fault, somehow? #SHRUGs
16 | Glenn Maltais | 10154679943003675_10154680434353675 | The fact that it's no longer debatable - climate change is altering our planet and life as we know it - does not mean the issue should not have been front and center last night.
17 | Nancy Gross | 10154679943003675_10154680543683675 | And he refused to say he would accept the outcome. He will paralyze and further divide the country with hatespeech and lies even after he loses.
18 | Brian J Rimando | 10154679943003675_10154679957648675 | This is a blowout...Hillary will win by a landslide...Mainstream media just keeping it close...
19 | Joe Trefelis | 10154679943003675_10154680074858675 | Here's something to report on ch 7 trump won the last two debates I believe it be a landslide proportion against Hillary she all hollow with no substance or crietdbellity

3 | PBS NewsHour | 10154679710938675_10154679740583675 | Leave your questions here in the comments for John, Daniel and Pamela!
4 | Cristhtian Perez Molina | 10154679710938675_10154679757963675 | Donald's response to Hillary's "puppet" comment was nothing short of a kindergartner's level of intellect. "I know you are, but what am I?"
5 | Jane Palmiotti | 10154679710938675_10154679762188675 | Donald lost this debate and I am looking forward to President Hillary Clinton...she is the most qualified.
6 | Karina Budd | 10154679710938675_10154679781278675 | Better someone who makes mistakes and owns up to them, then someone who tells us they do no wrong, always pointing finger at others and only they can fix things
7 | Ellen Rothschild | 10154679710938675_10154679771558675 | She's my choice as well as my husbands, all my adult children and their spouses.
8 | Sloane Christopher | 10154679710938675_10154679770898675 | Favorite quote from Vox. "The polls are split between Hillary Clinton winning and … Hillary Clinton winning in a landslide."
9 | Caroline Alexander | 10154679710938675_10154679738838675 | What are your feelings as the final debate comes to a close?
10 | Patricia A Lawrence | 10154679710938675_10154679764383675 | Obama is a man of dignity and grace . . . He's also really cool.
11 | Norma Jean Hulen | 10154679710938675_10154679768478675 | I think Hillary won the debate. His answer, "keep you in suspense" about his accepting the election results was like a cliff hanger in a reality TV show. It's scary to think how many people can't see through his ego issues.
12 | Teresa McInerny | 10154679710938675_10154679748108675 | HRC!!! Congratulations Madam President!! Well do e as always!
13 | Donna Demmin Church | 10154679710938675_10154679745553675 | Comment...'Wouldnt it have been nice if the first female president of the United States was someone we could have trusted and respected?'
14 | Nancy Lehman-Hill | 10154679710938675_10154679885003675 | He's said before that there will be riots if he doesn't win. He must really hate our country. Not saying he will accept the election results is slamming our entire democracy.
15 | Mobutu Kakata | 10154679710938675_10154679741783675 | Insulting females, hispanics, and not accepting the outcome. Real smart!
16 | Crystal Worley-Roberson | 10154679710938675_10154679756488675 | I was waiting for him to say, "I know I am, but what are you."
17 | Frannie Pagano Mattera | 10154679710938675_10154679793233675 | Abortions at nine months?? You support that? Billions from countries that deform women and kill gays?? Really? Wow, awesome supporters, that's why this country is going to hell
18 | Marilyn Kopecky | 10154679710938675_10154680098273675 | Gore the loser didn't concede to Bush the winner.Gore sued. Repeatedly. And he & his supporters never accepted the results.
19 | Karin Strat | 10154679710938675_10154679772688675 | Rigged election..... I still can't wait to vote .... Nov 28th !!! 💥
20 | Doug Meyer | 10154679710938675_10154679788443675 | Why do people think someone who claimed alot of bankruptcy would be good for economy?
21 | Gerry Brown | 10154679710938675_10154679787728675 | If he wins, is the Election still rigged?
22 | Richard Chadwick | 10154679710938675_10154679754653675 | He only has his base. He knows he will lose. Do you think He hopes to appeal to his future TV channel audience?
23 | Zhanjun Yang | 10154679710938675_10154679757163675 | Hillary won the debate and on many issues, but will her supporters come out and vote on 8th?
24 | Debbie Faulkner | 10154679710938675_10154679784358675 | He'll never accept an outcome that isn't for him. e.i. the emmys
25 | Chris Jazwinski | 10154679710938675_10154679786868675 | Hillary haters are over the top restating crazy stuff that has been debunked ovr and over again.

When debate moderator Chris Wallace asked Donald Trump if he would accept the 2016 election result, Trump replied 'I'll look at it at the time."

1 | Rosene W. Virgil | 10154679463573675_10154679501413675 | OK.............I attempted to NOT watch the Debate, but I have my Perspective in order Now....A Presidential Candidate of the USA should Always...and I quote (me)..."Compose Yourself in Victory and Graciously be Humble in Defeat"~~~~IJS (Rosene W. Virgil) "I'm with Her"
2 | Kim Dansby | 10154679463573675_10154679496918675 | Chris Wallace did a good job. He called out the BS on the spot!
3 | Jackie Bolton | 10154679463573675_10154679509028675 | Totally unacceptable to attack a basic tenet of our constitutional democracy.  He is disgusting and cares nothing about the country.  His entire life history is always to promote himself, to never apologize, and lie about anything to promote self and put others down.
4 | Robert B. Miller | 10154679463573675_10154679545008675 | I don't know how Hillary or anyone for that matter, can stand there and attempt to respond to this madman who isn't even fit to be on that stage or say a word. He is truly demented.......
5 | Priyanka Bomb Khadiya | 10154679463573675_10154679520943675 | Donald's view of being the commander in chief is, " My way or highway". Classic sign of beginning of a dictator! That's why we can't have him. Period.
6 | Karin Desnoyers | 10154679463573675_10154679566928675 | Somehow he thinks there is going to be a second season to his presidential reality show. Pretty sure his imaginary network cancelled his show tonight.
7 | Deb Chan | 10154679463573675_10154679657678675 | Debate left me feeling disturbed and sickened. He tried to not be "himself" in the beginning but of course lost complete control uttering "nasty woman" into the mic when Clinton was answering a question. I think that moment captures the true spirt of Trump.
8 | George Toth | 10154679463573675_10154679512153675 | Donald Trump should probably see a doctor or a psychiatrist to correct his mood disorder. Trump also suffers from a thought disorder that a cognitive psychologist might be able to help. Trump needs help. You could clearly see it tonight. Right???
9 | David Gray | 10154679463573675_10154679635028675 | How does she not laugh herself right odd the stage?  Honestly, I don't know how she has the strength to keep herself from jamming her own pen into her eye for having to be compared to him for the length of the debate.
10 | Lisa Hanson | 10154679463573675_10154679634468675 | I am continuously amazed and disgusted that this "man" is considered a serious candidate for the Presidency of this country.
11 | Gary Roberts | 10154679463573675_10154679837978675 | He has demonstrated time and again that he has NO respect for the Constitution.He is an unregistered sex offender who should be locked up for treason,espionage and fraud.
12 | George Waiters | 10154679463573675_10154679902513675 | I believe it was rigged also. But not the way you think. Donald was a joke from the beginning. He was dismissed by the republican candidates and not taken seriously. Like the monster with the Abby normal brain, he was entertainment until it was too late.Unless we allow a repeat of the corporal, a clear message has to go out. Frankly we have to do more than just win. The reverberations will be felt for years. Just how much will be determined by total rejection of what this man stands for.
13 | Patricia Susan Tyler | 10154679463573675_10154679573403675 | I mean I'm afraid of whoever wins may get hurt while in office and I don't want that for our country or any elected official. I home school and doing current events my 12yr old daughter said; mom this is worse than the Kardashians and their screaming at each other. She said it's embarrassing for the US.
14 | Katie Connolly | 10154679463573675_10154679821028675 | This man doesn't respect our Constitution or our traditions. He's an angry child, a bully..and if he can't win, he's going to smash everything in sight and walk away. Then again, he probably won't walk far..he's laid the ground-work for his next effort to make a ton of money off American suckers..a new media network.
15 | Ike Udechukwu | 10154679463573675_10154679884378675 | Does Trump really love America and its democracy? In the 3rd debate, people missed the link between two events that Trump espoused-----(1) Trump's inability to condemn Putin and Russia (2) Trump's refusal to accept concession as an integral part of America's democratic process. Trump's inability to reject Putin and Russia's ideal is an indirect repudiation of America and its policy towards Putin and Russia. Trump's refusal to accept concession as an integral part of America's democratic system is a direct repudiation of what America stands for. In one debate, Trump has directly and indirectly repudiated all or part of what America stands for. Trump is dangerous for America. Trump is so in love with Putin and Russia so much so that he willing to blackmail America either by coercing us into allowing him into the Office of President to help Russia destroy the US from within or we refuse to allow him get into the Oval office and the consequences Trump has promised is the incitement of violence to destroy the US from the outside. Either way, Trump is following the script given to hm by Putin and Russia. The script is simple: "Destroy America".
16 | Meredith Dunn | 10154679463573675_10154679507518675 | An absolutely terrifyingresponse. Undermines our country, our founders, all voters and the entire democratic process.
17 | Stephanie Bryan Erickson | 10154679463573675_10154679986143675 | And what does it mean if he doesn't "accept the results" of the election?? What, he's going to throw another tantrum? Move into the White House before her? Good grief. He's such a bully. And sore loser. He needs to suck it up and get over it. He's dug his own grave. No one rigged the election... except him. Every time he opens his mouth.
18 | David Bruck | 10154679463573675_10154679738578675 | What's he going to do?  Raise and Army and stage a coup?  Move his stuff over to the White House and tell everyone he's been elected? Snort another line and plan for 2020?
19 | Jinhui Chen | 10154679463573675_10154679511358675 | Copy from Courtney Stratton: Forget the smear campaign on both sides. Here is what we know. on immigration. Trump: Strengthen borders. Stop Syrian refugees until stringent vetting. Clinton: open borders increase Syrian refugees. on economy. Trump: Renegotiate trade deals more favorable to US. Reduce corporate tax policy allowing US companies to bring trillions back to US. Clinton: Keep corporate tax rates in place forcing more companies to seek tax breaks over seas reducing US jobs. Pro NAFTA Pro TPP. on Obamacare. Trump: Repeal and replace failed program. Clinton: Keep in place and tweak problems with program. on ISIS and national security. Trump: aggressively seek out and destroy ISIS. restore law and order to US. Clinton: Work to build more coalitions with NATO and continue failed efforts in place. on Abortion. Trump: Pro life repeal Roe v Wade end late term abortion. Clinton: Pro abortion pushing legislation to allow late term abortion during 3rd trimester. on 2nd amendment. Trump: Protect existing constitutional right to bear arms. Clinton: Push for elimination and radification of 2nd amendment abolishing right to bear arms. on Supreme Court appointees. Trump: Conservative appointees abiding by US constitution. Clinton : Liberal appointees moving toward a more open and accepting inclusive branch of government. on Government spending. Trump: eliminate waste fraud and abuse. reign in government spending. Clinton: Increase government spending by throwing more tax dollars at failed policies. on energy policy. Trump: develop and pursue energy from US companies. increase US consumption from existing clean coal. solar. wind and alternate sources. Clinton: eliminate clean coal pursuing additional energy sources abroad from middle east. on campaign reform. Trump: establish term limits. eliminate super pacs reducing big money from favoritism in government. Clinton: promoting pay for play politics as usual. if you can look through the smoke screen these are important issues every American really needs to weigh in on. Vote 2016 your vote counts!!
20 | Mercedes Batista | 10154679463573675_10154679553378675 | The guy keeps saying, I'll do this, I'll do that ....but he doesn't say how .... In spite that Chris Wallace was a pretty good moderator, he couldn't make the dummy to be coherent.
21 | Texas Liberal Veteran | 10154679463573675_10154680442813675 | Historians will unfairly judge this as a seminal moment that led to Trump's landslide defeat, and that is wrong. Trump has been building to this self-immolation since the onset of his campaign. This is simply when he chose to euthanize the patient.
22 | Lesley Ross | 10154679463573675_10154679693653675 | Chris is no Mike Wallace but he did a decent job although he didn't corner Trump on a couple of pointed questions when trump just went off into Trump land and never answered.  Not a surprise there lol
23 | Patricia Susan Tyler | 10154679463573675_10154679560473675 | Ok call me dumb for asking this but is there any possible way and I mean possible way somehow neither one of them can be President with how this campaign has gone? I mean it's out of control? Can congress or someone step in? I'm just asking because we have major issues with both.
24 | Jason Downs | 10154679463573675_10154680340848675 | This is probably the least important aspect of the debate when policies where finally addressed. Quit trying to push an issue with the sensless & stay on the issues please PBS. Losing respect for this news organization.
25 | Edward StJean | 10154679463573675_10154679554973675 | I believe there is no questions this election is rigged including the media support of Hillary including PBS. I watch PBS and listen to NPR every day and it is sick the one sided spin.

Hillary Clinton explains her stance on abortion and why she voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions as a senator. Donald Trump says he thinks such abortions are terrible. Watch our coverage: http://to.pbs.org/2e2zQtK
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lisa Kelley | 10154679400073675_10154679437293675 | She is an absolute hero for women's rights. She stated it perfectly. Government has no place in a very personal and intimate decision like this.
2 | Danielle Morfi | 10154679400073675_10154679460403675 | No trump doesn't understand what a late term abortion is. He thinks drs will remove a baby a few days before it's born. And. Kill it? Madness
3 | Karen Erdmann | 10154679400073675_10154679463803675 | the republican candidate knows very little about health care. To say that a doctor would rip a baby from the womb days before it is full term is so bizarre. To accuse doctors of murder is a horrible thing. He clearly does not understand health care.
4 | Kim Dansby | 10154679400073675_10154679437218675 | He thinks that someone is aborting a viable pregnancy at 8 months???? So ridiculous, so completely ill informed.
5 | Sarah Shelton | 10154679400073675_10154679508788675 | Having worked in women's health and perinatology research, that is not how late term abortions are done. There are always very valid reasons for these to be performed and Hillary explained it well.
6 | Linda Jean Adams Brackbill | 10154679400073675_10154679463098675 | Amazing he's so pro-life- he told his girlfriends to get abortions if they got pregnant. Marla refused and so he married her after Tiffany was born.
7 | Fanny Marzanh | 10154679400073675_10154679468503675 | If he feels so bad for babies getting killed for what I feel terrible also. So why does he doesn't agree on Gun control so children don't get killed by guns?
8 | Joseph Wilmarth Tyna | 10154679400073675_10154679445278675 | "We went after Bin Laden while you were doing celebrity Apprentice..." - Hillary
9 | Jan Weller | 10154679400073675_10154679459083675 | And Clinton has taken a note from his book by just talking on, and on, and on in order to defend herself... Why doesn't the mediator stop Drumpf like he does Clinton? Is it because he works for Drumpf's FOX network?
10 | Ric Brown | 10154679400073675_10154679461283675 | Trump thinks 'such abortions are terrible'? What does that mean? Trump's words are heavily salted with descriptive SOUNDING words that actually have little or no meaning in the context that he uses them. He seems to me to be a very superficial person.
11 | Allison Tysinger | 10154679400073675_10154679490248675 | Its strictly a medical decision to be made by a woman, her doctor and her family. Not gynoticians and fundamentalist regressives whose closest knowledge about women's bodies is what they learned from a Trump video.
12 | Deirdre Nichols Rasmussen | 10154679400073675_10154679517713675 | I think any discussion about abortion should include the fact that if it is illegal, there will be back-alley abortions and women will die.
13 | Sarah Schwindt | 10154679400073675_10154679901238675 | Donald doesn’t have a pro-life track record, even a little bit. On Meet the Press in 1999, Trump said, “Well, I’m very pro-choice” in response to a question about partial birth abortion. Later that year, he stated, "I believe it is a personal decision that should be left to the women and their doctors,” to the Associated Press. “I support a woman’s right to choose, but I am uncomfortable with the procedures,” he wrote in his book The America We Deserve in 2000. Even more concerning, a few years later during an interview with shockjock Howard Stern, Trump talked about how his first response to Marla Maples’ surprise pregnancy with one of his children was “what are we going to do about this?” In other words, he felt like he should have the right to consider abortion, so why believe now that he thinks other Americans shouldn’t?
14 | Lisa Bristol | 10154679400073675_10154679568168675 | You have never been an ER nurse holding these "babies" as they held your fingers while they took there last breath. It's not just a fetus you get rid of. Shame on Hillary. She sits behind a desk and is not in touch with the "real" world. Respect life and all will good things will follow.
15 | Martin Stankard | 10154679400073675_10154679820178675 | I am pretty darn liberal, and I get the argument, nor do I want to imagine the extreme scenarios; but I wish the hardest of hard Feminists could get together and oppose abortions past 6 months or so. I understand the reality is that that is an extremely rare...idk...I'm not an expert, but I do have a nephew who came out about 3.25 months early. I'm not pro Abortion, I am pro choice. Most of the pro-life crowd still wouldn't budge after my idea, but maybe a good few would come on board. Half of the problem related to late term is the lack of access early term...I feel a lot different about how acceptable the process is at 2 months compared to 5.Peace in the middle east, abortion. The issues that absolutely will not be resolved in my lifetime. And I'm pretty optimistic about science. With advances in modern medicine, I could live to be 500 years old. Still a sucker bet these items are still contentious.
16 | Hannah Hamilton | 10154679400073675_10154680141313675 | Jesus. When it comes to abortion, people just don't freaking listen. Late-term abortions are uncommon and almost always due to health complications with either the mother or the fetus. Trump is flat out saying "too bad, sucks for you." He's not even listening. He just implied that no matter how serious the health risks are, if a woman is pregnant, she must go through with it. I could never agree with that.
17 | Lizabeth Wallin | 10154679400073675_10154679819478675 | I think everyone can agree, late term abortion is horrific. With that said, I don't think a bunch of politicians should decide for me or my daughter or my daughter's daughter what is right or wrong in a medical situation. Just sayin'.
18 | Edgar Solomon | 10154679400073675_10154679475938675 | Extremely, huge, disaster, always, so many people, Very First time, unprecedented, worst ever, so bad, Wrong, A lot, Bigly.... Sniff, sniff
19 | Anita Zona | 10154679400073675_10154679806998675 | Why is it so hard to understand that one can be for or against abortion but that whether or not the government should be involved is a separate issue?
20 | Barbara Anne Kirkman | 10154679400073675_10154679891103675 | Trump has said numerous times that he has left the child rearing up to his wives up until their children turned into teen agers, and this is where he took over..but I have to ask this both he and his wife acknowledge that their 10 year old son, lives in his own pent house. Sad part about all of this he isn't a good parent, he cares so little for children and babies..why would he even have a statement to make on Abortion? It is none of his business to begin with. And why wouldn't he be upset over children killing or hurting themselves or others with unsecured guns? And why is it that he cannot make positive statement regarding education for all people at all levels? It is because he does not care about anyone other than himself. And this is who some people want to see become their next president.
21 | Sasha Dykeman | 10154679400073675_10154680902468675 | Duh, of course late-term abortions are terrible. But they remain necessary in SOME conditions to preserve women's health and future fertility. I don't understand why no one confirms the truth that a woman cannot sail into a clinic in her seventh, eighth, ninth month of pregnancy just because she "decides" right then that she does not want to go through with a pregnancy. No clinic in the US would perform such an abortion! Those abortions occur exclusively for women who desperately WANT to have a baby but cannot because it has only emerged in that late stage that the pregnancy is no longer viable (mainly because the baby's brain has not developed!). Carrying to term at that point is dangerous for the mother because a baby without a fully functioning brain cannot exit the birth canal properly, a woman risks bleeding to death or being ever able again to carry a fetus to term. Is it more ethical to let a baby be "born" who will never survive outside the womb and possibly take a woman's life and fertility with it, or to perform a very sad procedure--a late term abortion--to preserve a woman's health??
22 | Bronwen Walters | 10154679400073675_10154679492918675 | Let's skip this crap - and make Bernie Sanders Speaker of the House! Help elect the Senate and Congressional Democrats on your state's ballot. A Clinton Administration with Bernie Sanders as House Speaker will be a true change!
23 | Quil Love Van | 10154679400073675_10154680670403675 | Donald clearly don't understand the situation of women which is case to case basis when it comes to abortion.Mr. Trump you're debating a woman who knows what's feel like to experienced pregnancy .
24 | Dane Hartwell | 10154679400073675_10154679575633675 | Abortion is about the most discusting thing a mother could do. What if a man was too lazy to take care of kids and poisoned a woman so she would have an abortion? I'm sure he would be put in prison for murder. But women use this as birth control. Hillary claims she loves children but supports babies being yank from the womb and thrown in a cold pan to die. I'm pro choice because women can have abortion with wild plants. That's ancient ways. It's dangerous, therefore I'm pro choice. What upsets me is women who support this as if it's as simple as having your dead hair trimmed. It should be viewed as something tragic and to be done if there is no other choice. This should be up to the states to decide. Same with legal drugs and gay marriages. The government shouldn't have so much power over the people. Trump is almost too liberal to be a republican and this is not an issue with him. Now ted cruz is highly pro life. Trump is pro gay and all that. Give the guy a break
25 | Valeria Bigi | 10154679400073675_10154680758918675 | I do not want to have any more of this biased PBS campaign for Hillary Clinton. This is really the pits. And I am far from being Mr Trump´s supporter. It is just unacceptable

3 | Dave PartyPacifist | 10154679372818675_10154679762068675 | GARY JOHNSON FOR PRESIDENT. NO to TRUMP/CLINTON and their preposterous campaigns and reputations. Dont roll your eyes or give excuses for shameless crooks, their erroneous ways, deceiving facade, alluring words, rhetoric, promises, games, bickering, etc. Dont be that person that's negative, ill informed, mislead, closed minded, foolish.Has the Media polarize yor minds to red/blue, partylines, or him/her? The American people have more than THEIR two choices. We the people, are smarter and more passionate than that. We have grown beyond the affiliations of the past. We deserve real truth, integrity, moderation, options, and common sense. For the freedom given to us by our forebears was not to be confined to just two choices.Brothers and Sisters of the Republic, have hope. You can make history. Let not other countries see us as foolish and stubborn stuck in the same cycle. Think, dont forget the past and repeat it. See past the political dichotomy. Dont think siding with winner/loser, political affiliation but what is best for America, the basic good values. Look deep down inside, Heavens knows rash decisions, closed hearts, and inaction will misguide your perception and choice. There is no great infallible savior to solve everything/issues but only true good principles. The fate of the nation is in your hands.Lets join in to build a better future. For posterity, prosperity, and PEACE. Have courage and strength to tell others. Real issues will only be addressed by a real candidate. Solutions, action,   real concern for the average citizen. The United States needs fitting leadership that truly looks for the American people NOT donors, lobbyists, secret backroom deals, political allianges, special interests. One that has his countrymen and nation at heart. Together we can make it, YOUR VOTE COUNTS!GARY JOHNSON FOR PRESIDENT.

4 | Caitlin Crest | 10154679287423675_987802791348294 | She's reasonable, Deborah Cole, because she has made serving this country her life's work - when she's smiling, it's tantamount to how you look at a 3 year old throwing a tantrum.
5 | Marley Bian Macgleth | 10154679287423675_783766485098899 | Donald is worst.. I think he is not Desrving.. I will support CLINTON SHE HAS A GOOD SPEECH AND CLEAR..she Has a good plan though. God bless Clinton
6 | Karen Coates-Franchot | 10154679287423675_2117473068477017 | Republicans are saying that Hillary is crooked and she belongs in prison but our own judicial system has investigated rigorously and found that there is been nothing wrong with her
7 | James Ellis | 10154679287423675_1820415364913716 | He juist admitted that he will cripple the fairness of the Court by appointing political justices that echo his prejudices?  Not bright.
8 | Heather Coleman Voss | 10154679287423675_503162413212743 | Skilled Trades are desperate for qualified workers. This is my field. He is just absolutely lying. Bring your ties back from China and Mexico Donald, of you are so worried.

12 | Cauanna Gaudio | 10154679287423675_1657436017879844 | Donald Dump has no plan and doesn't know how to solve anything. He's a child that thinks he can "fix" with just promising he will
13 | Nikole Larsson | 10154679287423675_1847650542121917 | Donnie boy doesn't even understand what the constitution is or how it works. He's mistaking the presidents job for a dictatorship.

Tonight's debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is a climatic moment in a bitter campaign headlined by talk of sexual misdeeds and email malfeasance.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Allison Addicott | 10154679093718675_10154679266038675 | It might be related to the climate,  I suppose, and it would be fantastic to hear a discussion about global warming, but I think you intended to say "climactic".
2 | Dee Haverly | 10154679093718675_10154679417288675 | Thank goodness --- this is the last debate.....really, he talks about the news, etc. being curupt???? does he not realize that those who work in the news are American Voters!!!!
3 | Nick Campbell | 10154679093718675_10154679263333675 | I'm glad it's almost over. It's almost time to have to deal with either consequence.That being said... this picture alone says a lot about both of them. Do you really need your own planes? Clintons is paid for by taxes and special interests and Trumps is paid for by avoiding taxes and just being a showboating douche. Look at the difference though. One has a flag... the other, in its shameless grandiose, has no hint at anything related to America. Just his brand. His name. He's all about Trump.
4 | William Isenberg | 10154679093718675_10154679329093675 | There is no way h/c won the majority of votes in the DNC primaries when Sanders rallies had 100 thousand while h/c rallies barely a few hundred. You would take more time and spend more effort to go to a rally as opposed to voting. It flies in the face of common sense that you would get less votes than you had number of people at your rallies when attending a rally would take more effort than voting.

11 | Oscar Orlando | 10154679093718675_10154679233208675 | "Trump’s 5-step plan is as follows:First: I am going to institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service.Second: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.Third: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.Fourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections."
12 | Kasee Kiel | 10154679093718675_10154679241563675 | trump be racist and a bigot. he actually want me to work to take care of my 11 kids or he going to take away my benifits. he goin take away all your benefits if you dont work to take care of youre kids. trump be a racist and a bigot. vote for hillary 2016 this yeer

Tonight is the last time Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off on stage before Election Day. What can we expect during the final debate?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Joie Au Monde | 10154679065833675_10154679277173675 | They say the best defense is a good offense. That is Trump's downfall, he is constantly defensive. I'm glad this is the last debate and cannot wait for this election to finally conclude.
2 | Gareth Fales | 10154679065833675_10154679202198675 | It would be really good if we could hear about issues instead of Trump trying to turn it into a bad fiction show. He appears to have no policy opinions at all, or at best very vague.
3 | Edwards Greg | 10154679065833675_10154679166108675 | Expectations: Big, desperate theatrics from Trump who is well known for his lack of preparedness; and as usual, Clinton will be thoroughly prepared and poised. No wonder she's remembered by her grade school, high school and college classmates as being the hardest-working student.
4 | Gail Bishop-Davis | 10154679065833675_10154679489523675 | David Brooks was correct in his assessment; Mark Shields criticized Hillary Clinton for thoughtful, informative responses about her plans.
5 | Beatrice Salas | 10154679065833675_10154679208213675 | Really does it matter? I have made up my mind... but will watch only because I wanna preview of SNL's next skit. Enjoy the debate folk's ;)
6 | Mary Milling | 10154679065833675_10154679283993675 | Only watching so I can enjoy Gary Johnson's tweets and be informed on his and Weld's post debate discussion on Jimmy Kimmel live. The two candidates debating equally and thoroughly disgust me.
7 | Steven Wiley | 10154679065833675_10154679804518675 | WikiLeaks email drop has exposed Hillary Clinton’s view of small town voters who are worried about the chaos that globalization has caused, the deterioration of the American middleclass, our morality, the economy and our culture… She feels that small town Americans are “insular” and unenlightened, stuck in the past, resistant to progress and that we live lives that are not worth living…. They cling to their god and guns because they are backwards and uneducated…Her strategy of divide and conquer is now morphing into two new groups… The people who matter (City People) and the people who don’t matter (Country and Suburban People).. Having grown up in a small town, and also having lived in the city for the last 25 years I can say that I understand both sides of that coin… City life is fine. It is filled with cultural, social and employment opportunities that do not exist in the country and elsewhere. You can choose how and whether to connect with other people. You also have bustle and anonymity.However, some of us choose to live in a different way… Not wrong but different… It would be a mistake to believe that small town life is a easy peaceful existence. Believe me, living in a small community is not for the faint of heart.Small towns are a microcosm of the human experience, but with more intensity. You live shoulder to shoulder with your oldest friends, and your fiercest enemies. You daily encounter the person who cheated you; who stood you up; who broke your heart; and with people who know your complete history: every bad decision, every embarrassment and you are held accountable for all of your actions. In the big cities, there is a huge amount of anonymity which many people could not thrive without, but not in a small town America. Living in a small town is a psychologically raw way to live… Small town life also requires a deep connection to community that city people may not acquire. It generally means that you go to church because that is what is expected, and what almost everyone does. The church is just as much a meeting place as it is a place of worship… When you go to church your neighbors are there, in many cases your uncles and aunts are there, your cousins and school friends are there, your school teachers are there…. It means you are surrounded by people who know you and care about you… (The closest thing to it in the city is what you would call networking…) In a small town, the network is your neighbors, and you are expected to participate. Your neighbors are the ones who gather around you to celebrate births and mourn deaths. They plow your driveway when you have the flu. They raise money to help in a tragedy. They put an arm around your shoulder. They make casseroles. And you, in turn, celebrate, and mourn, and plow, and comfort, and bake. This sharing and mutual support is as old as human beings. And it is a good way to live.!.We live in a society in which the elites make a continuing push against the values of faith, decency and commonsense. The cultural gatekeepers promulgate the notion that someone who doesn’t live in your community can decide what’s wrong with you, and what you need because you are too ignorant to be able to figure it out for yourself. It’s an insult, and a barely veiled one. You are flyover country: insular, irrelevant bumpkins filled with prejudices, unable to participate in the enlightenment of the cities, destined never to be rich or famous. Living in a small town means that you are aware of the scorn heaped upon you by city dwellers who think they are better than you, and you shrug your shoulders and get on with it.Maybe resisting progress isn’t all bad. In an age of celebrity and reality television, of Instagram and Twitter, most small town people live out quiet, uncelebrated lives of dignity and depth. They work; they raise and care for their families and friends; they mow their lawns, they mop their floors. They may never be rich or famous... But they do have rich-lives worth living.And that is something worth standing for.
8 | Roger Komula | 10154679065833675_10154679281113675 | Trump acting bizarrely. Hillary trying to take the high road. Pointless questions. Moderator not controlling the orangutan. You know, the usual.
9 | Jane Logan | 10154679065833675_10154679214098675 | Trump will sniff his way through the debate while spewing nonsense making a complete fool of himself. After the debate, Trump will simultaneously claim he won the debate and that the debate was rigged... Alec Baldwin will do a perfect impersonation of Trump, the real Trump who has a pathological need for respect will tweet SNL and Baldwin aren't funny. Trump will lose and we can all relax...
10 | Charles Gardner | 10154679065833675_10154679159803675 | Hillary Wiki Leaks ✅ Proves that Hillary with direct emails lies...Taking money from horrible human rights abusers of women & young woman...Extremely careless with U.S safety and lied on just about everything...blatantly careless and untrustworthy...Proves Hillary is all about big banking and money...Saying that Latino's are needy and dislikes Christians❌The Clinton's made $250 million and were broke when leaving the White House...paid Chelsea $900,000 for 1 1/2 year... Sad.Voter Fraud❌
11 | Leticia Lansford | 10154679065833675_10154679162078675 | Evading answers to important policy questions and mudslinging is my guess.... But I'm going to watch
12 | Betty Ann Vaughan | 10154679065833675_10154679240623675 | Before you get too puffed up, Julian says he has lots on Trump too.
13 | Ariel Cruz | 10154679065833675_10154679286798675 | I voted for Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton in the ny primary and I agree with Jill Stein on pretty much everything but we can't allow trump to step one foot into the WhiteHouse. As of today Jill Stein is polling at 1% . If you supported Bernie Sanders and everything that he stands for and accomplished we should follow his advice and vote for Hillary Clinton in this election.
14 | Serge Shirikjian | 10154679065833675_10154679235913675 | Vomit vomit vomitThis will be like stubbing my toes for 90 minutes straight. For the record an enthusiastic GO HRC!!! ❤️️
15 | Hal Briggs | 10154679065833675_10154679206893675 | This debate will be moderated by an actual journalist, unlike the other two debates.
16 | Oscar Orlando | 10154679065833675_10154679233538675 | "Trump’s 5-step plan is as follows:First: I am going to institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service.Second: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.Third: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.Fourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections."
17 | Kasee Kiel | 10154679065833675_10154679241688675 | trump be racist and a bigot. he actually want me to work to take care of my 11 kids or he going to take away my benifits. he goin take away all your benefits if you dont work to take care of youre kids. trump be a racist and a bigot. vote for hillary 2016 this yeer

24 | MC CM | 10154679065833675_10154679480758675 | I would like the host Chris to talk more about why Mrs Clinton is even capable of standing here today on this stage  running for president? Considering everything she has been involved in during her many years on congress; ex.: Benghazi, the emails, all the lies, formation of Isis, etc. How is it even possible that she can run? Its a joke; a smack in the American peoples' face, really. And,  with her open borders policy, we soon will have multiple UN-safe zones aka, dangerous areas that are similar to exactly what's going on in Europe. But then again since we Americans are all diplorables, why not let this country be the  butt of the jokes.  I would like to hear about Donald's regiment m retirement plan along with bringing mothers back to work. Can we get down to business please. But I must say he has come a long way from his first debate. Much more in control of outbursts. I commend Donald. And its obvious she can't help but keep lying to us. So fake and scam artist!! Talk about it, please!

6 | Jeff Jeffrey | 10154678882753675_10154678931743675 | The reason our nation is so screwed up is due to republican obstructionism...get your "facts" straight and turn off info wars,fox news,etc...all propaganda BS bubbles.

9 | Brigid Kennedy | 10154678882753675_10154678894013675 | So now PBS is interviewing Carson?  What has this Country come to...
10 | Gary Reneker | 10154678882753675_1225939577464211 | Ben Carson?!? Really?. You couldn't find anyone more intelligent.. He's a neurosurgeon that obviously practiced on himself by removing his own pre-frontal cortex!
11 | Brigid Kennedy | 10154678882753675_10154678943118675 | If I were Hilary Clinton, I would not have stolen the primary from the progressives and independents...and like this pundit is saying, neither one of them has a very high road to take...that was Bernie...

22 | Brandy Henneberger | 10154678882753675_684178011758128 | You can expect Hillary to continue deny, dilute and diminish any and all allegations that have been made against her. She wants responsibility with no accountability for her actions.
23 | Αλεξάνδρου Απολλο Ζεοπιλθσ | 10154678882753675_1225943120797190 | Expect: Hillary Clinton to provide kick-a*s ripostes. And for her to be absolutely in tune and astoundingly adroit without any faltering. Hermes & Apollo at her side.And spare the people, close the door to Ben Carson.

As the candidates prepare for their final presidential debate in Las Vegas, the race remains close in Nevada, a swing state with a growing Hispanic population that voted twice for Barack Obama.

1 | Carole Mellin | 10154678539623675_10154678682073675 | Trump will have to move to Brazil when this is over (no extradition from Brazil). Illegally dealing with Castro's Cuba, illegally ripping off students of "Trump University", illegally accepting foreign donations to his campaign, illegal use of his "charity" money (his “Foundation” has now been shut down), bringing in illegals to work as “models”, leasing office space to Iranian terrorists...
2 | Bryan McKeon | 10154678539623675_10154678981193675 | A good candidate (like Sanders) would be trouncing Trump. Good job Democrats. You nominated a candidate who can barely defeat him hahaha. I refuse to vote for either of these candidates.
3 | William Isenberg | 10154678539623675_10154679096988675 | There is no way h/c won the majority of votes in the DNC primaries when Sanders rallies had 100 thousand while h/c rallies barely a few hundred. You would take more time and spend more effort to go to a rally as opposed to voting. It flies in the face of common sense that you would get less votes than you had number of people at your rallies when attending a rally would take more effort than voting.
4 | Carol Oliva | 10154678539623675_10154679000963675 | Leaked Fundraising Recordings say, Hillary called Bernie Supporters," Basement Dwellers." Do you really want to vote for someone who thinks so little of you?
5 | Michael Huron | 10154678539623675_10154678982173675 | Per PBS "...a growing Hispanic population that voted twice for Barack Obama" --> probably quite true, being Dim's ... i.e. they voted at least twice in 2012, as did several of the deceased. :p

Trump has exposed a dilemma that its impossible to remove public officials when much of the evidence is considered CLASSIFIED...interests of the official too closely tied to national security to make doing the RIGHT thing the WRONG thing and this is how a systems integrity ERODES over time..."If the FBI had indicted Clinton, it would have also been forced to open up an investigation into Obama’s role in putting classified information at risk to bad foreign actors. The Obama administration, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch, wasn’t going to allow that to happen."

Violating the records act.  All hidden under quid quo pro dirty politics. Ignoring 600+ requests for support, in the months before Benghazi. Standing over the caskets of four dead Americans, and lie to the faces of their families regarding the details of their deaths.HILLARY is qualified, in silencing women who have accused Bill of sexual harassment/rape over the years, including Linda Tripp, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick and many many more. Hillary is qualified in taking millions from countries like Saudi Arabia, and Yemen who treat women like second class citizens. I don't have time to discuss deplorables, disdain for Israel, Catholics and other Christians, or Hillary's evil support of partial birth abortions. Hillary is qualified for Pay For Play, stealing Millions from Haiti, not protecting Israel, Travelgate, millions made from Wall Street and over 200 million dollars made while "serving us". I would need a year to write about ISIS and the horrible relationship with Russia we now have or her other failures as Secretary of State. No Hillary has lied  and has had to many cover-ups to count.  No  Hillary America deserves better than you.   Trump is far from perfect and definitely an egomaniac with a mouth, but he is nowhere as dirty and corrupt as Hillary.   Wake up folks Hillary is not to be trusted in any way whatsoever.

1 | Luke Smith | 10154678488723675_10154678682378675 | If you think your state could use billions in tax revenues and might be better off with more jail space for violent criminals instead of stoners eating Doritos, you're definitely for the legalization of marijuana. PS: don't worry your kids can buy it from your neighbor anyways. At least if it's legal they won't have to go to a drug dealers house for it.
2 | Daphney Waggoner | 10154678488723675_10154678604908675 | Look at who's running for president, no wonder 60% want to legalize Marijuana. We need to be able to have options for the next 4 years. Just saying.
3 | Kim Gifford | 10154678488723675_10154678582578675 | Healing properties and quality medicinal uses. Only hasn't been legalized because govt wants to control who can feel better. Lol. Use don't abuse
4 | Donaldo Morales | 10154678488723675_10154678896568675 | This would be great if the government respected the will of the people, instead of the economic interests of corrupt politicians and police, and of "experts" on the subject who are not authoritues on the matter.
5 | Lynn Rene Hurst | 10154678488723675_10154678664048675 | I asked Michael how many people would drive under the influence if pot was legalized. He said "About the same number as do now." I laughed, he is so up front and to the point.
6 | Mary Milling | 10154678488723675_10154678687593675 | Well, the 60%should take a look at Gary or Jill, the only two candidates courageous enough to have it on their platforms. Hillary has too many well heeled friends making money off of privatized prisons (that her husband so successfully implemented) and Donald, I have no clue what he thinks. I try to not go there if I can help it.
7 | Anne Stewart | 10154678488723675_10154679898143675 | Angry hillary is planning on increasing federal action against pot. Yet another reason I won't waste my vote on either of these horrible choices. Voting for the only candidate left that espouses Bernie's platform. Going Green in 2016.
8 | Kimberley Petross | 10154678488723675_10154679427468675 | It's about time we stop letting people die from cancer. I'm tired of loosing loved ones due to the lack of education of so many.

9 | Mel Gee | 10154678488723675_10154678584748675 | I dont smoke pot, have never tried it in my life. However, I support legalization. The negative effects of legalization are so few while the criminalization of pot leads to devastating effects on so many people, not to mention the lack of regulation and crime that stems from drug cartels
10 | Marcus Seevers | 10154678488723675_10154679527788675 | And yet there has been no questions in any debates asking our presidential nominees where they stand on legalization when during the SAME election our most populist state is voting whether or not to legalize marijuana...smfh
11 | Beau Arnold | 10154678488723675_10154679172733675 | It's the hemp industry that could revolutionize the USA and the main reason for such taboo about a plant. Certain people like to "conserve" things. ;)

17 | Tracey Schelmetic | 10154678488723675_10154678652608675 | The other 40 percent are too distracted in their hunt for the Doritos to respond.
18 | Michael Alan Stephens | 10154678488723675_10154678590343675 | Hopefully, they'll legalize it before half of America is in prison.
19 | Poppy Barnard | 10154678488723675_10154678620308675 | Even doctors are recommending it to patients in illegal states the benefits are so obvious..Why is it illegal again?
20 | Angie Howell Caughlin | 10154678488723675_10154678752128675 | That number should be much higher then, since Gallup still uses land lines, lol.
21 | Maria McGowan | 10154678488723675_10154678661473675 | I don't smoke but think it should be legal. Look at Colorado. Seems to be good revenue.
22 | Randolph Graul | 10154678488723675_10154678802053675 | Yes, we can cut the legs off the cartels in this area. They won't stop trying in the other drug areas, but we can close one.
23 | Steve Clark | 10154678488723675_10154678630913675 | The intent is to help those in need of medical assistance - NOT to produce poor quality SYNTHETIC MARIJUANA which is often deadly or harmful...

The Smithsonian has created a Kickstarter campaign to restore the original ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz. #KeepThemRuby
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kate Harrow | 10154678387448675_10154678524723675 | THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS???  For old shoes from a movie? What would brand new shoes cost, and would we know the difference if you didn't tell us?
2 | Karen Dickson | 10154678387448675_10154678553393675 | Not such an important issue for me to give money to. In fact, it's pretty far down on my list of priorities. Wait, I checked,  it's not even on my list. Thank heavens. Silly waste of money.
3 | Karen Dickson | 10154678387448675_10154678570223675 | Also, one of the creepiest movies of all time and the abuse Judy Garland suffered at the hands of the studios don't really make me interested in this. I bet you could go to Target and fake it. No one would know and they're probably about $6.99, if that. Just sayin...
4 | Melanie Weiss | 10154678387448675_10154678597168675 | I'm not saying that these costume shoes aren't worth saving; I am thinking that the timing sucks - children being pulled from rubble, refugees drowning, unemployed people here in the US and childhood hunger a very real problem here. And can someone tell me why: major studios, producers, directors, fashion designers, etc weren't approached? Thirty of them donating $10,000 each would cover it.
5 | Susan Willm | 10154678387448675_10154678655353675 | I heard the price tag on NPR yesterday. Go to Michael's and for $10 you can buy a ton of red sequins, glue those puppies onto the shoes and you're ready to go!
6 | Cheyenne Lin | 10154678387448675_10154678809163675 | it's not the price that bothers me but that if you restore them they might lose their value. some things are meant to be loved and lost. yes the wizard of oz doesn't hold up that well today nor should the abuse Garland faced by the studio be tolerated but the Wizard of Oz shall be remembered as a marker in America cinematic history and not be forgotten.
7 | Lori Wilson | 10154678387448675_10154678832673675 | I love the ruby slippers. I saw them at the Smithsonian , but I dont think they should spend that kind of money on them, better to feed the hungry or something more pressing like homelessness.
8 | Ramon Pineda | 10154678387448675_10154678767948675 | The novel is greath piece of Americana but the shoes restoration can be paid by the Movie industry, they keep making the money with reruns so, with just one week of exhibit the movie at the Kennedy Center the 300,000.00 dollars may be available in no time.
9 | Ursula Seelig | 10154678387448675_10154680142838675 | Imagine if people gave that much money to an organization that helps humanity....a food bank, Habitat for Humanity, Doctors without Borders. I prefer spending my hard earned money that way, not restoring 80 year old movie shoes.
10 | Betsy Collins | 10154678387448675_10154678758508675 | Sure would like to see this money go to a really worthy cause: feed hungry children; provide vaccines; enhance schooling in the inner cities, etc.......
11 | Mattia Nuzzo | 10154678387448675_10154680304763675 | This is outrageous. The Smithsonian is a wonderful governmental institution funded by our tax dollars. If it is not getting the funding it needs then it should go to the people to put pressure on our legislators to ensure that it is. It should not start a Kickstarter campaign to ask for money which undermines the concept of a national museum that is equally funded to be enjoyed by all.
12 | Dave Secrest | 10154678387448675_10154678596313675 | Do they not make enough off the ticket sales they have made all these years, taxes pay for that place, we have to pay to get in. Now we have to pay to save a pair of shoes.
13 | Stacey Held | 10154678387448675_10154680887898675 | Well clearly even the executive board doesn't think it's worth the price for the restoration otherwise the smithsonian would pay the bill themselves. I agree with others who suggested perhaps making a public appeal for professionals to volunteer time and services or for the movie studio to help. These are movie props not works of art!
14 | Dawn Cajune | 10154678387448675_10154678541863675 | Last I heard the original one's where stolen from the Judy Garland museum in MN. Unless they found them and didn't hear about it?
15 | Jared Bowden | 10154678387448675_10154679119843675 | They're slippers. How many lives could benefit from this money? Cancer research, AIDS research, education, etc. Slippers? WTF?
16 | Garry W Campbell | 10154678387448675_10154678774013675 | The sign on the displayed shoes says the originals were stolen. These are fake replacements from the Dollar store. Toss em and upgrade to Walmart for two dollars. Problem solved. Next case.
17 | Phyllis Carter | 10154678387448675_10154678548293675 | I don't understand. I believe there were actually four pairs of those red slippers. If they have been in museums, showcases, all these years, how did they become damaged?
18 | Adam Beckett | 10154678387448675_10154678545128675 | Restoring would deny those shoes their historic significance?! Their current state is exactly the way they should look like, imho.
19 | Rhonda Smith | 10154678387448675_10154678537858675 | I'll do it for half the price! I just need red sequins and some glue.
20 | Janet Swift Egiziano | 10154678387448675_10154678716368675 | That's absolutely ridiculous. I bet the shoe repair guy in my neighborhood could do it for less than $250.
21 | Jodi Schupbach Marsh | 10154678387448675_10154678487928675 | I could see if they were from a real life event, but these are nothing more than backstage wardrobe fodder.
22 | Susan Murphy Hacker | 10154678387448675_10154678570418675 | Why so much? Perhaps the restorative company could DONATE their time working on the shoes in exchange for advertising??
23 | Robert Sullivan | 10154678387448675_10154678693128675 | MGM studios should offer pay for the restoration as a donation to the Smithsonian. They sure have made plenty of money over the years from this timeless movie!
24 | Stuart Rinehart | 10154678387448675_10154678942628675 | I know a guy with forty years experience alone in nearby Mitchell who could restore these for less than 200.00.
25 | Helen Child | 10154678387448675_10154678700823675 | $300,000! Are you nuts! Let them go. Take some good pictures and use the money to save the planet from our destruction.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Karrin W. Willey | 10154678100378675_10154678332248675 | Has anyone explained to what's-his-face that Barack Obama is not running for President & this half brother is not likely to bring black voters running to support Donald?
2 | Charlotte Cross Vann | 10154678100378675_10154678336413675 | I want to hear about three things in this debate:Social securityBalanced budgetForeign policy (especially Russia)What I don't want to hear about (again):1. Benghazi2. Emails3. Trumps treatment of women
3 | Brigid Guarino | 10154678100378675_10154678355433675 | This is so childish,no one will notice him except Trump supporters,he has none of the grace and smarts of his stepbrother, he is probably being paid for appearing.We should be dwelling on todays issues instead.
4 | Mary Perry | 10154678100378675_10154678497573675 | What a juvenile Trump is. Has anyone told him that the reason President Obama does not have a relationship with his 1/2 brother is because Malik belongs to Hamas, hates Israel, has multiple wives and basically stands for everything our President is against. I think this example of adolescent style revenge for Trump will be like spitting out the window when the glass is rolled up!
5 | James Swan | 10154678100378675_10154678293458675 | The whiny racist crybaby pulls third grade move.I,am so impressed.
6 | Stephany Kleinberg | 10154678100378675_10154678294773675 | Hamas supporting Malik? Anti Israel supporting Malik? Is trump out of the anti Semite closet?
7 | Gwen Tinnin Gartman | 10154678100378675_10154678568313675 | I just want a policy debate. Would love it if the rules stated that neither candidate was allowed to refer to the other unless the question directed them to...and a HUGE gong went off if they broke that rule.
8 | Dwana Chapman | 10154678100378675_10154678335043675 | If drumpf thinks it will lube up his followers, he'd dig a dead relative up. This is to pose for his undecided voter's. "Hey look at me I love being in the mud, you're my kind of people. Isn't this exciting, the big soap opera of stupidity, and hate I've created." He's like Jerry Springer, and his fans, but with less class, and intelligence. He knows his demographic, and a large portion watch fox only, and read the national enquire for the rest of their news. He's got them down to a science. Who cares if he's a sexual predator. If he mocks our country, military, minorities, and the handicapped. Who cares how many failed businesses, and lawsuits. He will stop abortion. They actually think he is against it, he flopped when he started running for president, how convenient. This is just more action to disrespect our democracy.
9 | John Shelnut | 10154678100378675_10154678363993675 | The Jerry Springer mudslinging has been entertaining, but does anyone know what their political platform is? Has anyone contested their ideas and visions for America if they became President?
10 | Chris Anderson | 10154678100378675_10154678595568675 | Who cares? He's a foreign national with no stake in this.. another clownish stunt perpetrated by the king of all douchebags. This is almost getting boring, watching orange hitler implode.
11 | Miguel Moya | 10154678100378675_10154678737033675 | Malik Obama supports Hamas. With this invitation Trump has insulted Israel, a US ally. Malik Obama does not support President Obama, who happens to be a popular president. Using the president's half-brother in this manner will not benefit Trump.
12 | David Kirby | 10154678100378675_10154678431958675 | None of these little tricks will rattle Hillary. I can't say the same for Trump when Hillary whips out Triumph and responds to his first allegation with "<insert lie here> to poop on".
13 | Gareth Fales | 10154678100378675_10154678359543675 | I know it won't happen but it would be nice if the side-shows would end and Trump would finally both discuss and justify his positions on something. Anything in fact that isn't soap opera material.
14 | Anthony Gelish | 10154678100378675_10154678530468675 | Apparently, in addition to Trumps general ignorance of our constitution, he is unaware President Obama is not running for office. What a laughably untalented stunt.
15 | Luke Smith | 10154678100378675_10154678634963675 | Lol, so that's how he's going to "get tough" with Putin and the Chinese? Throw a tantrum when they embarrass him and show up with their annoying relatives? Is this really happening?
16 | Momo Lititz Oishi | 10154678100378675_10154678521878675 | Trump wants to bring in guests to make it uncomfortable for whoever IS NOT running for the president and somehow he thinks this is the way to get out of prepping for the debate, doesn't he?
17 | Joyce Bunch | 10154678100378675_10154678569378675 | If the Democrats brought everyone that Trump sexual assaulted, cheated in business, scammed or lied to there wouldn't be room in the place.
18 | Paula A. Zancanella Bradford | 10154678100378675_10154678811933675 | Why obamas brother? This is between you and Hillary--not Bill, etc. put on your " big boy" pants and face this strong woman., ( I know it's intimidating, Drumpf)
19 | Joseph Jernigan | 10154678100378675_10154678302983675 | This kind of childish nonsense should be ignored, not reported.
20 | Chris Marsh | 10154678100378675_10154678719298675 | Right out of the script of Godfather 2....when Michael brought in Frankie Pentangeli's brother from Italy to sit in on the proceedings. The difference is....T.Rump IS NO Michael Corleone....
21 | Nancy Lewis | 10154678100378675_10154678859613675 | I' beginning to think the candidates are Bill Clinton and Malik as they seem to be in the spotlight. Anything to get the attention away from the candidate themselves.  How I wish one debate would include what their proposed politices are on the issues facing us.
22 | Thomas Earnshaw | 10154678100378675_10154678535863675 | Trump could only find people from other countries to support him at the debate so This guy is the best he could do.. He is So toxic right now even Republicans won't show public support for him right now..
23 | MJ Beal | 10154678100378675_10154678706278675 | Have read a lot about Malik, who the president doesn't really know and wasn't brought up with. Malik sounds like an opportunistic grifter. I wouldn't trust him....
24 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 10154678100378675_10154678457293675 | Trump Complete Meltdown 23 minutes into debate. Secret Service rush stage to protect Hilary, restrain trump leading him away as he's yelling, " it's rigged "!
25 | Dean MacDonald | 10154678100378675_10154679019543675 | Just a friendly reminder:  Obama isn't running and won't be there. Hillary wasn't rattled by the presence of Bill's bimbos, so this is just stupid. Trump is swinging blindly, hoping he might land a lucky punch. I've got my popcorn ready.

International aid agencies are preparing for what the United Nations estimates could be an exodus of as many as one million people.

1 | Hedy Bethany | 10154678036388675_10154679168223675 | Unreal UN is a joke! Thousands of people killed, women and children raped and killed, thousands of them, and Christians crucified etc. UN are Actually like three blind mice!
2 | Steve Clark | 10154678036388675_10154678636308675 | They need to take their help TO THOSE REFUGEES, rather than placing them at more risk by drawing them to other countries.
3 | Benoît Guillette | 10154678036388675_10154678562808675 | Zizek: “First complication: is the crucial choice today really that of liberal democracy versus fundamentalism or its derivations (like modernization versus resistance to it)? The only way to account for the complexity and the strange twists of today's global situation is to insist that the true choice is the one between capitalism and its Other (at this moment represented by marginal currents like the antiglobalization movement); this choice is then accompanied by phenomena which are structurally secondary, crucial among them the inherent tension between capitalism and its own excess. Throughout the twentieth century, the same pattern is clearly discernible: in order to crush its true enemy, capitalism started to play with fire, and mobilized its obscene excess in the guise of Fascism; this excess, however, took on a life of its own, and became so strong that mainstream 'liberal' capitalism had to join forces with its true enemy (Communism) to subdue it. Significantly, the war between capitalism and Communism was a cold one, while the big Hot War was fought against Fascism. And is not the case of the Taliban the same? After their ghost was concocted to fight Communism, they turned into the main enemy. Consequently, even if terrorism burns us all, the US 'war on terrorism' is not our struggle, but a struggle internal to the capitalist universe. The first duty of a progressive intellectual (if this term has any meaning left in it today) is not to fight the enemy's struggles for him.”SLAVOJ ZIZEK, WELCOME TO THE DESERT OF THE REAL!

4 | John Taylor | 10154678036388675_10154678234383675 | What Id like to see discussed...Plan to end income inequality raises across the board by companies making historic profits, an end to meddling in the middle east recall of our forces to this hemisphere mfg strategy that meshes with cutting edge tech science cuts to imports and a revitalized mfg sector. An end to CIA dirty tricks abroad and focus on cyberdefense.
