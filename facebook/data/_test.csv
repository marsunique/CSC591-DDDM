Don't believe the fake ads. You can't vote by text, even for state and local races. Period.

1 | Markus Alexander Isakson | 51 | 10155571083651509_10155571091871509 | Remember everybody, cnn said, due to violence between parties, Republicans vote on the 8th, and Democrats vote on the 9th. Make sure you pass it around and let everybody know.
2 | Jo Clarke | 22 | 10155571083651509_10155571086116509 | I love coming here to read the comments. Some people (like myself at times) are obsessed with reading comments. For example, we find you reading this comment right now, which does not contain any useful information, only curiosity, that drives you to waste your time. Have a good day. And God Bless America.

5 | Justin Roberts | 8 | 10155571083651509_10155571087301509 | I encourage everyone if you haven't seen it already to watch "Kingsman : the Secret Service" The part at end when everyone's head explodes... that'll be Van Jones and everyone on The Clinton News Network's panel tomorrow night when the results start rolling in and Donald J Trump is projected the 45th President of the United States.

Periodtrespass isn't from fake which is well informed witnessed by FPA conducts menstrual hygiene management', etc.! Truth weren't hidden!
7 | Lucas Bielejewski | 6 | 10155571083651509_10155571108711509 | Hillary Clinton took money from Saudi Arabia for the Clinton foundation after knowing they were funding ISIL in 2014. She sacrificed our national security for decades for her own personal gain.
8 | Michael Andrews | 1 | 10155571083651509_10155571105826509 | Duh!! Republicans can't, but democrats can vote via text, just text your vote to the number for your state! Don't believe the fake ads for Republicans, they must show up to the polls!
9 | Sam Iron Cloud | 0 | 10155571083651509_10155571115746509 | Lol. Trump talked about a rigged election and in turn created one! I feel sorry for his followers. When he loses tomorrow it's going to be a great day!
10 | Iyanda MEmyselfandi Believeinurself | 1 | 10155571083651509_10155571105206509 | Trump speech right now, is a disgrace to his family, Trump is just made for the world to say sorry for him, it will be ever mistake US will make if Trump is elected
11 | Mark Freitas | 1 | 10155571083651509_10155571113471509 | "DESPERATION" is the definition of Hillary's Campaign at this moment! Donald Trump is only a few points Behind in most historical Democratic states! And 3-7 points ahead in all the other states, and in all of the polls! Unless Donald Trump is killed there is no way that Hillary Clinton is going to win this Election! Hillary Clinton and all of her lamebrain Liberal supporters can support her in the Federal penitentiary!#TrumpPence2016🇺🇸
12 | Yonit Moshenberg | 1 | 10155571083651509_10155571119961509 | "In the last two days, they had so little confidence in his self-control they said we're just gonna take away your Twitter. Now, if somebody can't handle a Twitter account, they can't handle the nuclear codes," Obama said.
13 | Daniel Pejchl | 0 | 10155571083651509_10155571105441509 | we agreed that in order to live in peace with each other , we would, each of us, have an equal say .. our vote... the way the DNC ran this primary .. it took that equal say away... it basically said the agreement has been voided...
14 | Gary Doan | 4 | 10155571083651509_10155571084086509 | We now live in a country where a Trump sticker, can get your car burned. A Trump hat, can get you physically attacked. Campaign headquarters are being firebombed. Innocent men and women are being attacked by goons, paid to incite violence. The dishonest media is guilty. Journalistic integrity is nonexistent and propaganda is the norm. You can’t have government corruption, without media corruption. We have both.
15 | Zach Kerman | 9 | 10155571083651509_10155571084446509 | Well… the first female president should be someone to be proud of, not a felon who cheated and lied. She will be more remembered for her scandals than for being the first female president. Is Trump perfect? no, he isn't, but clinton is who will make your life a real hell. Think about it. Thank you - #TrumpPence #MAGA
16 | Patty Oaks | 4 | 10155571083651509_10155571091361509 | If you fall for something such as voting by text you probably shouldn't be voting.
17 | George Champion | 2 | 10155571083651509_10155571102966509 | ...but, you CAN vote up to 10 times on your iPad, e-mail and twitter!!!

19 | Alma Lucas | 0 | 10155571083651509_10155571130201509 | A sexist pig is far more acceptable than a genocidal maniac #vote Trump
20 | Susan Stephenitch | 0 | 10155571083651509_10155571121516509 | And there are Trump supporters posting on FB that Democratic voters can also vote on Wednesday due to some irregularities at the polling places.  Don't fall for it ! You must vote by Tues 11/8/16!!
21 | Cliff Mask | 0 | 10155571083651509_10155571117271509 | All Trump supporters vote no Nov. 28..remember only you can put a stop to this!!

25 | Charlie Arnold | 0 | 10155571083651509_10155571117681509 | Interesting. FOX NEWS says Trymp is winning. MSNBC says Hillary is winning. CNN says they're waiting for the Hillary camp to instruct them what to say.

2 | Rodica Iova | 56 | 10155570967576509_886032911497518 | Fellow Americans, let's stand united after the elections. Don't let other agenda pull us apart, no matter who wins. We will respect the new president. Don't let others start riots. Be calm.
3 | Peter Yacobellis | 30 | 10155570967576509_1156172794466884 | Climate change is the defining issue of our generation and only one candidate actually believes in it. There is no choice in this election. Vote for Hillary if you care about the Earth.

6 | Rene Williams | 35 | 10155570967576509_1156173137800183 | The same Al Gore who has made millions off the global warming hoax and flies his huge fuel guzzling jet everywhere he goes! Haha haha! Sure!
7 | Amanda Acree | 10 | 10155570967576509_886037638163712 | If you doubt hlobal warming or climate change, then you're as blind as a naked mole rat. It's going to continue to get worse without action.
8 | Mir Rahman | 12 | 10155570967576509_901575639973098 | A real leader always thinks about our next generation not the present. Only educated pple understand what he is talking about
9 | Bob Harvey | 15 | 10155570967576509_1283477095017080 | I wonder if he flew in a private plane that burns 350 gals an hour of fossil fuels, putting more carbon in the air in one trip than the whole city is talking in, in a month?

13 | Nelofar Bahar | 19 | 10155570967576509_10155571051641509 | Why president Obama campaigns for Hillary? Becaus if Hillary win the election, she would defend His crimes around the world and also will defend from Saudi Arbic... that is why the whith House trying for Hillary...
