Florida goes from ‚Äúlean Democratic‚Äù to ‚Äútoss-up.‚Äù
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Maureen Mc | 6 | 10154786686014729_10154786789034729 | The good people of Florida will cast the vote that serves their economic and social interests and those votes will be for Hillary Clinton. Many folks in Florida are from the NE and they know a con when they see one.
2 | Elizabeth L Jones | 7 | 10154786686014729_10154786733379729 | To be clear: there is no acceptable excuse for James Comey‚Äôs overt, intentional violation of The Hatch Act, which Congress passed to protect our republic from future excesses of, for instance, FBI Directors, using their sweeping powers to undermine our democratic processes and free elections. The only remedy The Hatch Act allows is the immediate removal of Director Comey from his position. NOW.
3 | Annabelle Collins | 0 | 10154786686014729_10154786936669729 | Republicans have been convinced since the 1990s that the Clintons are criminals. They have spent 25 years and millions of dollars from the public treasury investigating the couple. And they now point to the 25 years of investigation as evidence that the Clintons must be engaged in some sort of criminal activity. Perhaps they are, but the GOP hasn't had much luck uncovering it.
4 | Sharon Lietaert | 1 | 10154786686014729_10154786785689729 | A newly released email from WikiLeaks is just the latest evidence of the cozy relationship between the Clinton campaign and CNN.The February 2015 email entitled "Heads up - between us" shows that CNN sources leaked the results of polls to the Clinton campaign prior to publishing them. The results were leaked initially to Joel Benenson, a pollster and the Chief Strategist to Clinton campaign. They were then forwarded to chairman John Podesta, campaign manager Robby Mook, and Clinton aid Huma Abedin amongst others."I think you are going to enjoy a poll we have releasing tomorrow morning at 6:00 am ET that asks about 2016ers and whether they are perceived as candidates of the past or candidates of the future," the email from a "source" at CNN reads. "Some interesting findings..."This isn't the first time CNN's journalistic integrity has been called into question by a leaked email. Earlier this month it was revealed that interim chairperson of the DNC Donna Brazile had leaked a debate question to the Clinton campaign.

6 | Russ Cardwell | 3 | 10154786686014729_10154786760049729 | It's sad, too, because there are more Democrats here, but Republicans come out to vote. The gerrymandering also doesn't hurt their cause.
7 | Roya Rahie | 16 | 10154786686014729_10154786687869729 | Mrs Clinton is our next president, no matter what. Are you guys with me?
8 | Henrik Ahlm | 0 | 10154786686014729_10154786987789729 | Why vote Clinton and not Trump?It is one of the most simple questions to answer if you got a normal functioning brain.Like the editorial board of one of the world's most respected business newspapers said today:"Mrs Clinton carries enough baggage to fill a Boeing 747. She is not trusted by the majority of voters. But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US. Period!And U.S. gun owners - men in black are back on Election day!
9 | Shirley Szafranski | 5 | 10154786686014729_10154786744799729 | I stand with my fellow Democrats. Vote blue all the way Hillary/Kaine #45 on the way.

It will qualify the Green Party for recognition as an official national party, and for federal funding in the 2020 presidential race proportional to the amount of votes received ‚Äî at least $8 million to $10 million. It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state). It means the party can leap over the undemocratic barriers to ballot access for independent parties in many states, and help us lay the groundwork for a truly competitive challenge to the two-party system and the corporate rule it perpetuates."Third Party Presidential Forum:One week before what‚Äôs shaping up to be an historic presidential election, Tavis Smiley on PBS will host a presidential forum featuring the third party candidates, Jill Stein of the Green Party and Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party.This forum will be taped live Monday, October 31, 2016, in the show‚Äôs Los Angeles studio and air on Tavis Smiley over two nights next week on Mondayevening and Tuesday, November 1 on PBS.

For much of this year, Obama, like the people who pack his rallies, has puzzled over what happened.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Larry Laibson | 3 | 10154786039314729_10154786443069729 | People are finally starting to recognize that his "Change to America" is far to the Left with Big Government, Big Social Spending, a new form of "enslavement" and not what the majority of American's want.
2 | Cheryl Heymans | 0 | 10154786039314729_10154786627914729 | Guess the establishment, the DNC and the billionaire corporate masters shouldn't have crowned Hillary Queen before anyone else entered the race. Because we all know that Bernie‚Äôs campaign offered hope and change, with no daily scandals but we're stuck with the most despised and least trustworthy Dem candidate of all time.
3 | William Allen | 0 | 10154786039314729_10154786677824729 | He trusted in the fact other countries could be reasoned with, he pushed redistribution and he had little real experience in a mostly white power base.I'm glad we had our first black president,  I wished him the best, I prayed he would do well, but in the end some of his work was great, and like life, some didn't work out well.He arrived in Washington DC at a really bad time, so the first 4 years he spent righting a listing ship.Personally Obamacare helped me in some ways, hurt me in others.My stocks went up.I got a house at a good price,  sold a clunker, bought 2 new cars tax free thanks to his programs, and I think he really tried.He won't go down in my book.as the best president,  nor the worst.I think . Michelle Obama may have a bright future in politics.
4 | Daniel Mochrie | 4 | 10154786039314729_10154786122459729 | He shouldn't be he was involved in criminal activities on Hillary's home brewed server. He should not be shocked at all. The FBI need to file charges on him to for lying about it.
5 | Chris Momdjian | 1 | 10154786039314729_10154786521369729 | I mean they called him an illegal alien Muslim Communist anti Christian before he was ever president so how was he supposed to appeal to these brainwashed Fox sheep? He's still polling much better than Trump and Clinton.
6 | Ronnie Rochelle | 0 | 10154786039314729_10154786378714729 | So much hope, yet so little results. The most racially divisive president in our history. Foreign policy.. worse than Carter which is saying a lot !
7 | Alex Mogo | 3 | 10154786039314729_10154786513684729 | When The Trump Campaign sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're sending red necks. They're sending white trash. They're sending low life POS. They're Republican FBI hit jobs, They're sending Ring Wing Breitbart KKK Conspiracy Lies , They're are sending KGB Russian Hackers to win the election for Trump, They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems to us. They're bringing hate. They're bringing fear. They're deplorable and some, I assume are good people!!!???

9 | Frances Scott | 0 | 10154786039314729_10154786625649729 | Trump will be running this country, not Putin, as Hillary would have us all believe. Trump is for Law and Order and as he says Hillary should be in jail. Hillary is the one who "KNOWS" Putin, sold our uranium to Putin so Putin could in turn sell part to Iran, so they can make a bomb to kill us/our children/our grandchildren. Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of America. I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself. Hillary threatened Bill women who he molested/raped/attempted to molest on National TV, sent private detectives to dig up dirt on them and had them ALL audited by the IRS. Hillary stands for open borders, for a One World Government but Trump stands for America and Americans.

This is their ‚ÄúForm 990‚Äù required by the IRS for all charities. In 2013 they had total revenue of $148,889,439 (Line 12). Their TOTAL Grants to Charity were $8,865,052 (Line 13). That is a measly 5.95%!!!!! Now, they are so efficient that it cost them a total of $84,684,494 in expenses (Line 18) to give away $8,865,052 to charity!!!!Including $29,914,108 in salaries (Line 15), $185,970 in fundraising fees (Line 16a, that‚Äôs actually legitimate), and a WHOPPING $45,719,364 (Line 17) in ‚Äúother expenses‚Äù!!!!!So AFTER all that hard charitable work they end the year with $247,299,458 (Line 22), a cool $100,000,000 more than was contributed for The year!!! Folks, no matter how you slice and dice it, this is simply a blatant money laundering program. They don‚Äôt even try to hide it!!! Oh and Congress wanted to investigate the Clinton Foundation and the DOJ stepped in and blocked it!

Why not act LIKE A JOURNALIST, and say, we don't have all the facts, the letter is so vague it seems to be causing more confusion and skewing of facts. We haven't heard from any reliable sources as to whose emails they actually are, whose device it was, etc. It is obvious that you are becoming angered at anyone speaking to the, let's wait and see instead of jumping to conclusions based on a letter of non evidence of anything, besides the fact Comey got his feeling hurt by coworkers not speaking to him and his admissions he spoke to his wife Katherine about ongoing FBI classified investigations.
5 | Charlie Kraebel | 3 | 10154786033429729_10154786096484729 | All this means is Hillary is going to win by fewer electoral votes and will beat Trump in the popular vote by fewer than five points. More than 18 million votes have already been cast, and in a best-case scenario for Trump, he gets to 266 in the Electoral College.Where does he get the other four?

Trump is for Law and Order and as he says Hillary should be in jail. Hillary is the one who "KNOWS" Putin, sold our uranium to Putin so Putin could in turn sell part to Iran, so they can make a bomb to kill us/our children/our grandchildren. Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of America. I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself. Hillary threatened Bill women who he molested/raped/attempted to molest on National TV, sent private detectives to dig up dirt on them and had them ALL audited by the IRS. Hillary stands for open borders, for a One World Government but Trump stands for America and Americans.

This is their ‚ÄúForm 990‚Äù required by the IRS for all charities. In 2013 they had total revenue of $148,889,439 (Line 12). Their TOTAL Grants to Charity were $8,865,052 (Line 13). That is a measly 5.95%!!!!! Now, they are so efficient that it cost them a total of $84,684,494 in expenses (Line 18) to give away $8,865,052 to charity!!!!Including $29,914,108 in salaries (Line 15), $185,970 in fundraising fees (Line 16a, that‚Äôs actually legitimate), and a WHOPPING $45,719,364 (Line 17) in ‚Äúother expenses‚Äù!!!!!So AFTER all that hard charitable work they end the year with $247,299,458 (Line 22), a cool $100,000,000 more than was contributed for The year!!! Folks, no matter how you slice and dice it, this is simply a blatant money laundering program. They don‚Äôt even try to hide it!!! Oh and Congress wanted to investigate the Clinton Foundation and the DOJ stepped in and blocked it!

6 | David Bozzi | 99 | 10154786389619729_10154786638909729 | Hillary scares the GOP like no one else ever has. Is it any wonder they have been trying to destroy her for over 25 years with baseless lies and empty investigations. I am with Hillary 100%.

12 | Ben Webb | 22 | 10154786389619729_10154786618559729 | So Secretary Clinton flubbed email handling. What is supposedly to be found in these emails; what is the possible smoking gun we should all be so bothered about?

24 | John Davidson | 8 | 10154786389619729_10154786636689729 | It's seams that head hunting HILLARY has taken lead over fixing the obviously broken system. Nothing is ever discussed about what actions are being taken to solve this from ever happening again.

Although October ‚Äî and its surprises ‚Äî have become cliche in politics at this point, it‚Äôs hard to remember a final month of a presidential campaign that has contained so many twists and turns.

And refusal to release tax records even though pissed and moan for Romney to release his  3) Operating a Fake university  4) Fake Foundation
2 | Daniel Mochrie | 2 | 10154784402249729_10154785029664729 | Every Dog has it day. Soon it will be Hillary Clinton's day in Federal Court. The thing I love about this the most is that there is nothing you or the lying Media can lie about, or blame Trump for on this matter. This is all Hillary's mess and she only will have to answer for her corrupt ways.The good news is that Bill Clinton is very happy it wasn't his Weiner that got Hillary in trouble this time.
3 | Nicolle Martin | 0 | 10154784402249729_10154786293194729 | Hillary did this to herself....don't blame Comey....her lies and corruption caught up to her....it is almost funny that a pervert Weiner brought her down.....but our country safety is at stake....did Weiner send these emails to Russia????
4 | Alex Alvarado | 4 | 10154784402249729_10154785024144729 | Copy from Facebook page of Kevin M Carney(opposing Views.) A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!
5 | Moji Hoss | 0 | 10154784402249729_10154785973444729 | People who are collecting Government handouts‚Ä¶Trump supporters, the Rednecks of America, or as Hillary call them the ‚Äúbasket of deplorables‚Äù are usually consumed with the so called people who are " just looking for government handouts that future generations will have to pay for." Do you know the Government handouts that Trump has so far collected from GOVERNMENT, all by himself, by his own admission, is so much bigger than the handouts that millions of supposed single moms of America has collected as ‚ÄúGov. Handouts‚Äù? No wonder, they call you ‚ÄúRednecks‚Äù & ‚Äúdeplorables‚Äù.Corporate America is collecting more Government Handouts than all people on welfare list (X 10).
6 | Danny Babcock | 0 | 10154784402249729_10154785901374729 | It‚Äôs JUST SMOKE --There are questions to answer about how the FBI Director informed on the Clinton emails to review‚Ä¶ but, the fact is how he did it just stirred things up! The Director ‚Äúshould have‚Äù shared that even after the FBI reviews the Anthony Weiner computer emails, there is little chance any charges will be filed against Clinton and  ‚ÄúCareless but Criminal ‚Äù, included in the FBI's original case evaluation will stand. Several legal experts have since shared that in fact that there is little chance any new charges will result from the review. The FBI determined that even careless handling of classified information did not make Clinton guilty of a crime. FBI hasn‚Äôt reviewed them yet; but the FBI shared that some, if not all, will be likely be copies of emails they already have.

9 | Marcia Tanabe | 1 | 10154784402249729_10154784454624729 | Had enough of scandals?  A vote for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka and the Green Party is a vote for a viable multi-party democracy going forward."Just 5 percent of the national vote for the Green Party Stein/Baraka ticket can be a true game-changer for American politics. It will qualify the Green Party for recognition as an official national party, and for federal funding in the 2020 presidential race proportional to the amount of votes received ‚Äî at least $8 million to $10 million. It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state). It means the party can leap over the undemocratic barriers to ballot access for independent parties in many states, and help us lay the groundwork for a truly competitive challenge to the two-party system and the corporate rule it perpetuates."Third Party Presidential Forum:One week before what‚Äôs shaping up to be an historic presidential election, Tavis Smiley on PBS will host a presidential forum featuring the third party candidates, Jill Stein of the Green Party and Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party.This forum will be taped live Monday, October 31, 2016, in the show‚Äôs Los Angeles studio and air on Tavis Smiley over two nights next week on Mondayevening and Tuesday, November 1 on PBS. An additional thirty (30) minute conversation, with questions selected entirely from social media will be available exclusively online at the Tavis Smiley PBS website.Viewers may submit questions to the candidates via Twitter, Instagram and Facebook using the hashtags: #TavisSmileyForum, #AskJill or #AskGary.

The Saturday afternoon incident in Phoenix, which was captured on video, revived long-standing anxieties about xenophobic and white supremacist rhetoric used by a fringe faction within the GOP nominee‚Äôs base.

1 | Danny Babcock | 11 | 10154784385319729_10154784702644729 | Trump‚Äôs own big mouth is killing him... and on a daily basis. Then he picks Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani has two of his pallbearers. Trump is coming unglued! The man is insane. He brings the Tasmanian-Devil to mind, he acts and talks just like the cartoon character. Clinton isn‚Äôt perfect, but after the three debates, it‚Äôs very clear Trump doesn‚Äôt have the intelligence, or temperament to be President. Now add that Trump knows he's in trouble, so it's the Media, it‚Äôs the Clintons, it‚Äôs the Establishment, it's rigged polls, his shorts are too tight, it‚Äôs those women, it‚Äôs the rigged and corrupt system that's doing it to little Donny Trump. If the Democrats could rig elections why are the House and Senate in Republican control? If elections could be rigged, the GOP sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt have Trump as their nominee.

Do you know the Government handouts that Trump has so far collected from GOVERNMENT, all by himself, by his own admission, is so much bigger than the handouts that millions of supposed single moms of America has collected as ‚ÄúGov. Handouts‚Äù? No wonder, they call you ‚ÄúRednecks‚Äù & ‚Äúdeplorables‚Äù.Corporate America is collecting more Government Handouts than all people on welfare list (X 10).

It would turn us backwards 30 yearsTRUMP AND HIS TOP ADVISORS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI FOR HIS TIES TO RUSSIA AND PUTIN!LETTER FROM HARRY REID TO FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY:Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) says that FBI director James Comey is sitting on ‚Äúexplosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.‚ÄùComey isn‚Äôt telling the American public what he knows about Trump and the Russians, Reid says. But, he says, Comey seems eager to dish dirt on Hillary Clinton.In the course of investigating Anthony Weiner for sexual misconduct, the FBI gained access to a computer that had also been used by Weiner‚Äôs estranged wife, senior Hillary Clinton advisor Huma Abedin. The computer contained emails that may have been relevant to the FBI‚Äôs earlier investigation of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private email server.When Comey found out about the computer, Reid points out, he notified Congress immediately ‚Äî if vaguely ‚Äî that the FBI had come across this new evidence. In Reid‚Äôs view, that presented a strong and troubling contrast to the FBI‚Äôs silence over Trump‚Äôs supposed Kremlin ties.‚ÄúThe double standard established by your actions is clear,‚Äù Reid writes.This letter is serious business. Reid writes that ‚Äúmy office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act‚Äù ‚Äî the law that prohibits most federal employees from engaging in partisan political activity.‚ÄúThrough your partisan actions,‚Äù he tells Comey, ‚Äúyou may have broken the law.‚ÄùThe Hatch Act is what prevents members of the US military from attending political rallies in uniform, or government workers from wearing campaign pins to work. In other words, it applies to activity that‚Äôs a lot less significant than what Reid is accusing Comey and the FBI of: selectively telling the public about information that could be damaging to one candidate, while not telling it about information that could be (much more) damaging to her opponent.‚ÄúThe clear double standard established by your actions,‚Äù Reid concludes, ‚Äústrongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group.Will be updated regularlyIF YOU CARE, SHARE!#HillYes #Hillary45 #ImWithHer #Hillary2016 #BlueLandslide #StrongerTogether #ClintonKaine2016 #HillaryClinton2016 #VoteBlueUpAndDownTheBallot

16 | Frances Scott | 0 | 10154784385319729_10154786634149729 | Trump will be running this country, not Putin, as Hillary would have us all believe. Trump is for Law and Order and as he says Hillary should be in jail. Hillary is the one who "KNOWS" Putin, sold our uranium to Putin so Putin could in turn sell part to Iran, so they can make a bomb to kill us/our children/our grandchildren. Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of America. I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself. Hillary threatened Bill women who he molested/raped/attempted to molest on National TV, sent private detectives to dig up dirt on them and had them ALL audited by the IRS. Hillary stands for open borders, for a One World Government but Trump stands for America and Americans.

Hillary is the one who "KNOWS" Putin, sold our uranium to Putin so Putin could in turn sell part to Iran, so they can make a bomb to kill us/our children/our grandchildren. Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of America. I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself. Hillary threatened Bill women who he molested/raped/attempted to molest on National TV, sent private detectives to dig up dirt on them and had them ALL audited by the IRS.

That is a measly 5.95%!!!!! Now, they are so efficient that it cost them a total of $84,684,494 in expenses (Line 18) to give away $8,865,052 to charity!!!!Including $29,914,108 in salaries (Line 15), $185,970 in fundraising fees (Line 16a, that‚Äôs actually legitimate), and a WHOPPING $45,719,364 (Line 17) in ‚Äúother expenses‚Äù!!!!!So AFTER all that hard charitable work they end the year with $247,299,458 (Line 22), a cool $100,000,000 more than was contributed for The year!!!

1 | Timothy Madsen Sr. | 18 | 10154782519319729_10154782723199729 | So the FBI has had this laptop for 5 weeks and hasn't even gotten a warrant to look at it? Yet the Republican Director feels the need to memo the Congress 11 days before election day?
2 | Marty Dart | 12 | 10154782519319729_10154782634679729 | The investigation that isn't an investigation into emails that may or may not be on a computer, may or may not be from Hillary, and may or may not be emails they've already seen?...that "investigation"?
3 | Carolyn Peterson | 8 | 10154782519319729_10154782766294729 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks.
4 | Jay Villaluna | 6 | 10154782519319729_10154782725639729 | Another much ado about nothing. People on Trump side keep harping on about emails, yet strangely these emails are from aides and not Clinton's herself.
5 | Sara Drake | 1 | 10154782519319729_10154783491424729 | "As WND reported Sept. 8, Clinton forwarded an Aug. 8, 2009, email ‚Äì clearly marked ‚ÄúClassified‚Äù ‚Äì to a personal, nonsecure email address registered to aide Abedin, huma@clintonemail.com. Abedin then forwarded the message to another personal, nonsecure account, humamabedin@yahoo.com.In sworn testimony before Congress, however, Clinton declared, ‚ÄúThere was nothing marked classified on my emails, either sent or received.‚ÄùThe 2009 email, sent to Clinton from longtime adviser Sidney Blumenthal, was discovered in a cache of emails obtained by Judicial Watch through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The exchange concerned the ‚Äúdisastrous nature‚Äù of an Obama trip to Germany, charging the U.S. was ‚Äútotally out of the loop in Berlin ‚Äì no ambassador,‚Äù resulting in the expectation that ‚ÄúGermans and Russians will now cut their own separate deals on energy, regional security, etc.‚ÄùWND also reported two-thirds of Abedin‚Äôs released emails were forwarded to personal addresses she controlled and Clinton‚Äôs State Department chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, may have received classified information through personal email accounts.Read more at http://www.wnd.com/2016/10/hillary-sent-marked-classified-info-to-nonsecure-abedin-account/#XODOuRgmbgoUYLSR.99
6 | Badr AlMehmadi | 1 | 10154782519319729_10154783822379729 | "Throughout this campaign, Mr. Trump has demonstrated an inability to handle criticism or blame well. His first instinct is to lash out at others. When challenged, he often responds as a child might. He makes a sour face, he calls people by insulting names, he waves his arms, he impatiently interrupts. Most families would not allow their children to remain at the dinner table if they behaved as Mr. Trump does. He has not exhibited the self-control, the discipline, or the emotional depth necessary to function credibly as a President of the United States.From the beginning of his campaign, Mr. Trump has conjured up enemies. First it was eleven million criminals in our midst, all bent on obtaining the benefits of citizenship, at our expense. Over time, the enemies became any trading partner of the United States. He says they are nothing but foreigners seeking to threaten our livelihoods. Now we have reached the point where his idea of America‚Äôs enemies includes almost anyone who talks or looks different from him. The goal of the Trump campaign, from the outset, has been to stir up envy, resentment, and group hatred.This is the worst of American politics. I fear for our cohesion as a nation, and for our place in the world, if this man who is unwilling to say he will abide by the result of our national election becomes our President.This is not the time to cast a jocular or feel-good vote for a man whom you may have briefly found entertaining. Donald Trump should not, cannot, and must not be elected President of the United States.‚Äù - Bill Weld Oct 2016

Never. Ever, FBI would drop a bomb on election, because of purely uncertain situation that may or may not be serious;  Director, James B. Comey: ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.‚Äô‚Äô & "The FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant," Director Comey has a responsibility in this situation to say, okay my deputies that find all this information on Weiner‚Äôs computer, I have to study this information carefully ‚Äúmyself‚Äù before I could make any decision on them, and therefore could take his time till after the election for any correct decision making.I think President Obama should respond to his political move by his FBI Director very Forcefully and very Quickly.

10 | Kris Payne | 0 | 10154782519319729_10154785029689729 | Right lol...Hillary Clinton is saying it is unprecedented that the FBI would inject itself this close to Election Day and many of her media supporters just go along as they do with everything else she says or does.Hillary knows full well that special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh actually indicted Casper Weinberger four days prior to Bill Clinton's election in 1992. As with almost everything Hillary does, she lies.As for unprecedented: Never before have we had a presidential candidate who:- As Secretary of State used a private server and broke the nation's security laws by trafficking classified documents on non-secure devices- Unilaterally decided which E mails to dump. Does anyone actually believe that the number she destroyed was only 33,000? These E Mails were bleach bitted after a Congressional Subpoena. Does anyone believe only personal E mails were destroyed?- As Secretary of State approved the sale of uranium reserves to the Russians and diverted money from the Haitians to her friends and family. She has taken kickbacks throughout her adult life starting with the $100,000 for cattle futures almost 40 years ago.- When answering questions to the FBI and Judicial Watch her most favorite go-to answer was I do not recall. This has been her favorite answer throughout her adult life. She is repeatedly described as extremely intelligent. Did she actually not recall or did she lie? If she didn't lie does anyone want anyone with that poor a memory as President?- Had a White House, State Department, Justice Department and others who also violated security laws and therefore spent their time protecting the Presidential candidate instead of working for the American people.- Had subordinates, who like her, were willing to commit perjury to protect themselves and her.- Had an FBI director and Attorney General who essentially admit that she violated the law but decided that she might not understand the law so wouldn't charge her. That is mind-boggling.- Had a media that was so in the tank that they have never cared what she actually did or said. Can anyone imagine the reporting on WikiLeaks if it were her opponent‚Äôs secrets being revealed?Now, all of a sudden this candidate who has spent her entire adult life hiding and lying demands pretends that she wants complete transparency from the FBI.The media, Democrats and Hollywood knew who they were getting with Hillary, a law breaker, perjurer and serial liar, and they always looked the other way.  But now they are outraged that someone in Government might actually do their job because they want power, nothing else.The news media knew most or all of this before they endorsed her. They have made a great effort to keep the public uninformed on what Hillary has said and done. They should be embarrassed that they endorsed her. Now they are essentially saying the election is rigged because the FBI might actually do its job.

13 | Richard Klein | 1 | 10154782519319729_10154783777334729 | People understand Stronger Together is the grand design for human survival and, a peace of mind. I love I'm with the party of beautiful caring people with a great convention and, historical speeches. I fear nothing. I don‚Äôt have near the women problem Trump has. The sky is not falling. Yes, I favor the democrat issues. My healthcare is good and, I feel great. I selected my own primary care doctor and, gained many other essential things. So, if you think some of Trump‚Äôs voters are going to stop us from being Stronger Together, you are so wrong! We don‚Äôt mean any ill feelings. I realize some may have gotten a grudge. But, that‚Äôs you and, not us. Democrats did not   try to default on the nation‚Äôs debt. The debt is a serious matter. This tells me the republicans do not have educated thinkers to run this country. The country could have been seriously harmed or, destroyed. The Republicans will ride any wave that comes their way if it will grab them power, including electing this habitual sexist liar Trump for President. Republicans think they don‚Äôt have to take any responsibility for anything no matter how heinous it is. Republicans may have another 8 years to re-think their, ‚ÄúI got an axe to grind!‚Äù and their, ‚Äúhate‚Äù behavior. The world is much better and, bigger than what the republicans can see. So, I don‚Äôt expect them to see, Stronger Together with her is truly the only place for me.

Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of America. I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself.

Ever since Trump launched his presidential campaign in June 2015, he has attracted massive crowds to rallies across the country. 
But instead of celebrating the actual size of these crowds, Trump has routinely exaggerated the already large numbers.

1 | Kathryn Rubenstein | 33 | 10154782517804729_10154782521649729 | His rallies are just a bunch of poorly educated bullies. They can follow Trump all the way to Trump TV when he loses BIG LEAGUE.
2 | Melinda Francais | 6 | 10154782517804729_10154783430754729 | Don't care how big they are....do the math...because most of the Trump supporters are at his rallies, and those numbers might add up to, maybe, a million people...and that's just not enough to win an election. Meanwhile...Hillary has the awesome 'ground game', and ground games win elections.

What words???...I have the best words... I get my information from watching TV... I consult with myself because I have a great brain... A great brain???...the best brain...Trump will also build a big wall to keep Mexicans out and he will make Mexico pay for it!...How....??? its all part of the great plan!...ISIS will be gone very, very quickly...How???... I won't tell you.. It's a secret !!!... (This guy is a ‚Äúone-man circle jerk‚Äù and he is only about entertaining the uneducated who love him and his great plan. He's all air - no substance.

"Unsurprisingly, neither the Pentagon nor the Department of State made clear how providing well over a billion dollars in controversial munitions to a known funder and supporter of the Islamic State would assist in the effort to fight the Islamic State.However, it would additionally be worth pointing out that even before the ‚Äòofficial‚Äô formation of the ISIL, Saudi Arabia and Qatar had long-established records of egregious human rights abuses of apparent little consequence to the U.S. government and Hillary Clinton.Read more at http://thefreethoughtproject.com/clinton-us-govt-saudi-funding-isis/#bzVujH1XM9w7ClZV.99

Trump is for Law and Order and as he says Hillary should be in jail. Hillary is the one who "KNOWS" Putin, sold our uranium to Putin so Putin could in turn sell part to Iran, so they can make a bomb to kill us/our children/our grandchildren. Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of America. I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself. Hillary threatened Bill women who he molested/raped/attempted to molest on National TV, sent private detectives to dig up dirt on them and had them ALL audited by the IRS. And you want to call me delusional, I do believe I have proven here WITH FACTS who is delusional. Now try to have a nice day!!!!!

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Carolyn Peterson | 9 | 10154782406794729_10154782767874729 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks.
2 | Paul David Menser | 14 | 10154782406794729_10154782494444729 | FBI investigating Russian hacks and possible ties to a Presidential candidate's campaign? Can't comment, wouldn't be prudent or ethical.
3 | Elijah Stines | 2 | 10154782406794729_10154783910604729 | She started running ads in Texas and Arizona and Trump only has a two point edge in Utah. Oh yeah, by the way, the last Alaska poll had her up 3. Finally, the public saw the politicization of the FBI letter on full display while no new information was brought forth. Bad week?
4 | Elizabeth L Jones | 3 | 10154782406794729_10154782660489729 | Top Justice officials told Comey not to send the letter--but he went right ahead with the unethical choice to trash the Democratic candidate for President with innuendo, 11 days out from the election, for his own future career purposes... How ignominious and craven!
5 | Cheryl Heymans | 3 | 10154782406794729_10154782494019729 | If her polls have dropped this much, before the FBI news, where will her polls be by Wednesday?  Time to drop out Hillary and bring back Bernie.
6 | Nikki Roberts Venter | 5 | 10154782406794729_10154782626994729 | And she has only herself to blame. She's been shielded for a long time by a media purposely turning a blind eye to the level of her corruption. The pot was bound to boil over.
7 | Paul Botts | 2 | 10154782406794729_10154782888764729 | Voting for the same two parties decade after decade expecting a different result is stupid!The first requirement for a candidate is integrity neither Clinton or Trump have it.
8 | Alejandra Garcia | 2 | 10154782406794729_10154782631304729 | Honestly, her worst week sounds like walk in a crappy park compared with Trump. His whole campaign is like that forest in Japan where ppl go to die.

23 | Hector Perez | 2 | 10154782406794729_10154782416449729 | It is absolutely obvious that the FBI has been infiltrated by an othe twisted conservative such  as it was the case with J. Edgar Hoover!!These kind of conservatives are absolutely twisted!!!J. Edgar HooverU.S. Federal GovernmentThe first director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation whose power base extended past presidential authority, J. Edgar Hoover was a racial conservative who considered many Civil Rights Movement activists to be dangerous subversives and Communist sympathizers.  Claiming that the FBI was "not a protection agency," Hoover had ordered agents to avoid intervening in civil rights crises and to limit their activities to observation and note-taking. In addition, he had ordered surveillance of several key figures in the movement, including Martin Luther King, Jr..  Hoover chose not to pass along intelligence received from Klansman and FBI operative Gary Thomas Rowe to Attorney General Robert Kennedy about the planned May 14 riot at the Birmingham Trailways Bus Terminal, giving the Kennedy administration no way to prevent the violence. At the May 20 riot at the Montgomery Greyhound Bus Station, Hoover's FBI agents stayed inside several parked vans taking pictures. The agents' film later turned out to be defective.  J. Edgar Hoover served as Director of the FBI for mare than 40 years, through the terms of 9 presidents.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=720098861335799&set=a.545188042160216.126306.100000070765022&type=3&theaterhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/freedomriders/people/j-edgar-hoover

We don't often know the signs of in-person voter fraud or vote rigging because we see the real thing so infrequently.

1 | Zack Goncz | 5 | 10154779433709729_10154779820994729 | Well, who needs journalists, poll workers, police, the FBI, the FEC, Attorney Generals, District Attorneys, US Attorneys, Judges, or even laws and the Constitution at all. Every Republican is Facebook Batman now.
2 | Cheryl Heymans | 3 | 10154779433709729_10154779876204729 | Election rigging is what happened during the Democratic primary.  Hundreds of thousands of voters purged, party affiliations swapped, voter suppression and rigging of actual machines. Funny how Hillary won every state where there were no paper trails and Bernie won most, maybe all, of those with paper trails. The vast collusion between Hillary, Google, FB, the DNC and the media guaranteed the corporate queen would win. They were responsible for the abysmal debate schedule,  the months' long major media (tv) blackout of Bernie,  continuing to include her super delegate count to give the appearance of her leading by a lot more than she was, Google hiding unfavorable stories, her paid media whores who continually attacked Bernie while writing pro-Hillary stories, and the vast voter suppression when the AP called her THE WINNER (not presumptive nominee) on the night before the Cali primary - when most of the delegates were up for grabs.  How many millions stayed home on Tuesday? If you can't see how this would sway an election, then you deserve Trump.It was rigged alright, by both Hillary's collusion and unprecedented numbers of election fraud.‚ÄúThe work we did to prepare for Hillary Clinton, to be our nominee and then make sure that we could get her elected president, is absolutely critical to advancing the issues that are important,‚Äù she said.

On Election day November 8, 2016 +100.000 men in black will pay unannonced visits across America to gun owners and if you cannot prove you have been home all day your guns and ammo will be confiscated and you'll be presented with a hefty fine and possible looking at doing some time.

This election has uncovered a lot of truth & so have these LEAKED EMAILS:: TRUTH that Hilary broke the law by having a server & having TOP SECRET, CLASSIFIED Information on her server; which she used BleachBit to wipe clean (not with a cloth!); Hilary had 13 devices (not one for convenience like she lied about) & confessed to smashing them with a hammer; she told the FBI that she didn't remember what Classified meant; that Hilary will LIE TO YOUR FACE while you bury your child that she helped kill in Benghazi; Hilary hates Catholics, Gays, Arabs, Bernie Supporters & blacks (those super predators); Obama made sure the FBI didn't indite Hilary & emailed her knowing she had a private email account-(proving he also broke the law & KNEW she was breaking the law!); had Bill Clinton secretly meet with the DOJ Loretta Lynch on the airport Tarmac which was NOT about discussing grandchildren for over 30 minutes; the State department tried to BRIBE the FBI to Declassify some of Hilary's emails; the DNC rigged the system & stole the election from Bernie; tried to ruin Trump with sexual allegations that couldn't be denounced and proven false in time before the election- KNOWING that such allegations would be harmful even though they were NOT TRUE & that she tried to destroy the women who made sexual assault allegations about her husband; the democrat party has set up people to fight at Trump rallies and to incite violence & have PAID THEM TO DO SO; Dead Democrats are voting & George Soros (who OWNS Hilary) is linked to voting machines in 16 states that have major electoral college counts; Hilary & Bill have sold out our country for MILLIONS of dollars to Countries that SHE KNEW WERE FUNDING ISIS!!!! How in the hell can you support the continued corruption in our government?!? If Hilary wins there will be NOTHING nor No branch of government to stop her!!! She has already proven that!!! Please take off your Republican & Democrat hat & start thinking like an American!!!  Read the damn emails and stop swallowing the bullsh#t the democrat party, Hilary & the main stream media are shoveling down your throats!!! Think like an American  & pick back up those "principles" that you gave up to support the corruption of these "Political Parties"!!!

19 | Halo Jaeger | 1 | 10154779433709729_10154780531324729 | OMG. THIS IS REALLY GOOD... You just can't make this $hit up!! OK this is what's happening, So James Comey, FBI was investigating Carlos Danger aka Anthony Weiner, husband of Huma Aberdeen, right hand of Hillary Clinton, for sexting a 16 year old. They have had his laptop for several months, when one of his agent realized that he had memos from the President to Hillary on there from Hillary's secret server. So Comey got scared and realized, Oh $hit, this is going to be bad. So to cover his A$$, He reopened the Criminal Investigation on Hillary's Server. They have seen some of these emails, but there are many many more. And remember Hillary lied to the FBI, Congress, the Dept. of Justice and said she gave them everything and that there were no classified documents on the server and no more devises. So they have to get a Court Order to look deeper into the Laptop, But Loretta Lynch / Justice Dept. is not giving them one, not yet. who knows maybe never??? How is Lynch going to justify not doing so without looking guilty, there is no Tarmac to hide on! Also they asked Carlos Danger aka Weiner, how many people did you send nasty picture to? He said no MORE than 100 women. So this laptop may have been compromised, over and over and over. But it doesn't end there, the FBI Agents showed Huma Aberdeen an email from the President (which had his alias on it and she exclaimed, 'But why isn't marked classified?" That's called a smoking gun! Because it came thru Hillary's Privet Server, and the President knew, so he did not do the proper procedure on sending said memo. He was Complaisant!!! They should all go to jail! It will be interesting to see how Lynch is going to slither out of not giving a search warrant for that laptop!

It is impossible to know for certain what Trump has given to charity, because he has declined to release his tax returns. In all, The Post was able to identify $7.8 million in charitable giving from Trump‚Äôs own pocket since the early 1980s.

In public appearances, Trump often made it appear that he gave far more.

This Trump, who secretly was proven to have a sexsual relationship with Putin (a ruler of Russia, who made Trump crawl on the floor while whipping Trumps hairdue with a goosefeather all the while Trump begged for mercy and cried out loud. Trump campaigned in vane 'cause he wasn't sane. Trump also tried to bribe the FBI to make vague false claims. Trump lost the election to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who we all remember as the president, who made the U.S. great again (brought manufacturing jobs back to the US) and who was the president, who negotiated a lasting peace in the Middle East.

Trump is coming unglued! The man is insane. He brings the Tasmanian-Devil to mind, he acts and talks just like the cartoon character. Clinton isn‚Äôt perfect, but after the three debates, it‚Äôs very clear Trump doesn‚Äôt have the intelligence, or temperament to be President. Now add that Trump knows he's in trouble, so it's the Media, it‚Äôs the Clintons, it‚Äôs the Establishment, it's rigged polls, his shorts are too tight, it‚Äôs those women, it‚Äôs the rigged and corrupt system that's doing it to little Donny Trump. If the Democrats could rig elections why are the House and Senate in Republican control? If elections could be rigged, the GOP sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt have Trump as their nominee.

And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation.

Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of Amercia. I remember when Obama and Romeny were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself.

D> FBI Director begins to think about having to find another job, and in a desperate move, sends this letter to make it look like there was "SOMEthing" where there was actually "NOthing."(and they have the nerve to call Hillary "corrupt!")The solution?  VOTE BLUE up and down the ballot and kick ALL of these #GOP yahoos to the curb....and let Hillary get busy making America work for EVERYONE, beginning January 2017.November 8th can't get here fast enough!GRAB 'EM BY THE BALLots!

This Trump, who secretly was proven to have a sexsual relationship with Putin (a ruler of Russia, who made Trump crawl on the floor while whipping Trumps hairdue with a goosefeather all the while Trump begged for mercy and cried out loud. Trump campaigned in vane 'cause he wasn't sane. Trump also tried to bribe the FBI to make vague false claims. Trump lost the election to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who we all remember as the president, who made the U.S. great again (brought manufacturing jobs back to the US) and who was the president, who negotiated a lasting peace in the Middle East.

1 | Judith Saunders | 35 | 10154778987139729_10154779064104729 | Conclusion: he cared more about covering his own ass than he did our election. Oh yes, he is a republican, and he only told republicans. Maybe he saw a way he could influence the election
2 | Abbey Yussuf Jimoh | 31 | 10154778987139729_10154779037574729 | I dare say it, HRC is gonna WIN. I'm not an American, neither do I reside there. I'm rather smart enough to know that Comey is bowing to GOP's pressure to undermine Clinton's chances at the eleventh hour. I'm certain people are too. It won't fly.
3 | Paul Matthew | 11 | 10154778987139729_10154779080799729 | If there was any question as to where Comey's loyalty "lies", this has cleared it up: the Gutless Oppression Party. It certainly isn't with looking into the bribe that Conald Chump paid Pam Bondi to not investigate Chump U.
4 | Danielle Anderson | 12 | 10154778987139729_10154779093704729 | I am glad to see that there is some integrity left in the government and that Comey has enough left in him to do the right thing and his job. #staysafe
5 | Patricia Meisels | 4 | 10154778987139729_10154779209539729 | The time has come for Comey to bid his "adieu" and go on his way. He was pressured by the hijacked Republican Congress and he caved. He serves at the pleasure of the President, and he needs to hand in his resignation. I doubt that President Obama will ask for his resignation this close to the election, but, he should resign and hopefully HRC will win and can appoint a new head of the FBI. This man with all of his "integrity" that I have heard about damned day was surely lacking in this case.  #Disgusted
6 | James McHenry | 1 | 10154778987139729_10154780521479729 | He was a hero to you folks when he went on tv, laid out a case for indictment, and gave her a pass for stupidity.

7 | Tom Stowe | 4 | 10154778987139729_10154779144594729 | None of this would even be taken place had the one so many say is the most experienced to become POTUS, just followed policy, and not used a private server for government business. Right Madam Secretary?
8 | Dusty Meyers | 1 | 10154778987139729_10154780052104729 | Not really. The lines in the sand were already drawn. Maybe more clearly than in any other presidential race in modern history. In other words- Nobody gives a fuck about this. Those voting for HRC are still voting for her. Those voting for Trump are still voting for him. On November 9th we'll all wake up to the same country with the same problems. Congress will either stop fucking around and do something about it or they won't. Shit will still be shit.
9 | Charlie Kraebel | 7 | 10154778987139729_10154779088149729 | Has anyone stopped to think there is no way Comey and the FBI would move forward with this without the OK from the Justice Department?

10 | Carl Jackson | 1 | 10154778987139729_10154780558729729 | They don't have to update a damn thing they are the FBI that is Hillary Clinton behind pushing for a update she wants to get away with this same thing that her husband did back in 1980s is the big deal with China she wants the big bonus pack $500 million that is why she is fighting and more money from the Saudi Arabia and Wall Street in New York City ladies and gentlemen it is all about money with the Clintons
11 | Jack Reed | 0 | 10154778987139729_10154780897404729 | I would guess he contacted the congressional committee because he realized that the DOJ would have tried to prevent him from reopening the case. I have no doubt that the DOJ made threats to him during the prior investigation. Now he has secured some protection to execute justise without interference.

The #GOP and #Trump would be wise to contemplate a valuable life lesson that Dorothy Rodham taught her daughter. When Hillary was faced with ill spirited adversity, Dorothy presented a simple building tool, a level, for Hillary to gage the conscious balance of her actions. Hillary learned adept constructs of the architecture of human nature and vicariously, good judgement. Misfortunately,Trump's father encouraged the brutality of his son's killer instinct, as a centric life lesson. The whole political environment is suffering in the throes of Trump's brutality! *Our country has never been in greater need of feminine wisdom and leadership! #HillaryClinton welcomes and respects Republican values. While GOP leaders are succumbing to Trumpian brutality, the country is being ripped at the seams that bind us. The fate of our nation is precariously dangling on the capacity of The Republican Party to acknowledge the wisdom of Dorothy Rodham's lesson. Ironically, in time, Trump's tower of brutality will fall because the impetus of human survival is stronger. Please lean a tad to the left Republicans, find your balance and reunite us against hostile Russian aggression!  <3 #StrongerTogether

The following is an exchange that occurred upon the death of SCOTUS Chief Justice Scalia. I am alarmed by the telling hatred displayed by those who would have us believe them to be open-mind, unbiased, and tolerant of other points of view.

Regardless of how worse a presidential candidate she might be, Americans just cannot afford to elect Donald Trump as the next President of the United States. Considering his explosive temperament, lack of knowledge on national and International affairs, his coarse and vulgar behavior, his penchant for autocracy and his affinity toward dictators, Americans should show their outright rejection of him at the ballot box on November 8. He is the most unqualified and worst ever presidential candidate America has ever produced. He is dangerous, unfit and most unworthy a candidate to be considered for the highest office in the land. His election will not only spell disaster for the U.S. but the entire world as a whole. In view of the above, America must elect Hillary Clinton as the next President of the Unites States if they have the best interest of their own country and the interest of the International peace and stability upper most on their minds.

We thought FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state was over in July. Turns out, the story's not over yet.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Carolyn Peterson | 24 | 10154776361909729_10154776820324729 | Come on, Comey. Since when does the FBI comment on an incomplete, ongoing investigation? And 11 days before an election that this disclosure could affect? Comey should be investigated
2 | Rhonda Worley-parsley | 9 | 10154776361909729_10154777320369729 | This does not even pass the smell test. Let's look at it. In the original FBI report (page 11) it was revealed that State employees were allowed to use their own personal email addresses for official business as long as they registered their addresses with MIS and were aware of sensitive information. All one has to do is look at the emails that the FBI released as part of a FOIA request and it is clear that Huma frequently forwarded work emails to her personal email account. The FBI knew this. Why didn't they look at her personal computer before? Why did it take a sexting investigation involving her husband to cause them to look at her computer? So, in looking at the letter, they are investigating to see if there was any "classified" information. Are they going to "upclass" again to make an issue? These are Huma's emails. They have already questioned her about her understanding of classified info. This is a political witch hunt--disgusting.
3 | Dorte Christiansen | 2 | 10154776361909729_10154777403009729 | This has nothing to do with reopening the investigation... this has to do with emails found on a private server belonging ro Anthony Weiner and one more person, which could have been written in the same timeframe as Secretary Clintons.

4 | Moji Hoss | 1 | 10154776361909729_10154777721029729 | FBI is Re-opening the Hillary File This announcement by Mr. Comey is purely political announcement, 100%, no doubt. Never. Ever, FBI would drop a bomb on election, because of purely uncertain situation that may or may not be serious;  Director, James B. Comey: ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.‚Äô‚Äô & "The FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant," Director Comey has a responsibility in this situation to say, okay my deputies that find all this information on Weiner‚Äôs computer, I have to study this information carefully ‚Äúmyself‚Äù before I could make any decision on them, and therefore could take his time till after the election for any correct decision making.I think President Obama should respond to his political move by his FBI Director very Forcefully and very Quickly.
5 | Diane Wilson | 2 | 10154776361909729_10154777750824729 | Obviously a Republican ploy by Comey. Come on Washington Post investigative journalists. How can it be THAT difficult to expose Trump's current tax returns? I believe it would greatly affect the election and it is surely the Electorates RIGHT to KNOW.
6 | Brava Ctc | 3 | 10154776361909729_10154778627879729 | Another witch hunt...who cares..the orange thing has a open case in court for the rape of a 13th year old but by all mean let's talk again about the freaking emails...lol
7 | Jonathan Tamayo | 2 | 10154776361909729_10154778859424729 | It's a nothing burger at this point. But no one better than Trump to make nothing look like something already and boy is he seizing on it right now!... the standards for him and Hillary are set at such different heights, it's ridiculous. On the left, you have a woman who has mishandled Emails whom is far from being the first or the worst on the federal level yet, she gets treated like she's the first of her kind.On the right, you have a man who is a proven two face racist, xenophobic, homophobic and misogynist who questions America's election system, refuses to release his taxes returns, makes false statements 70% of the time, mocks the disabled and brags about being a sexual predator. And somehow, Hillary is just as bad.That's the biggest Media Malpractice I've seen in my lifetime. This might be the only fake "October surprise" Sexual Predator Trump needs to get across the finish line. The bar is that low for him while Hillary's bar is up in the clouds. Sad. Just sad.
8 | Petra Doll | 3 | 10154776361909729_10154777548389729 | WP you forgot one key word, Comey said she was 'extremely careless'. But we all know it was a cover up. More will be revealed and Hillary will pay for her sins to the world on November 8th.
9 | Cissy Williamson-Brown | 3 | 10154776361909729_10154776841524729 | Careless during WAR is treason it aides the enemy. The WAR is not figured in and it should.

11 | Scott Gregory | 4 | 10154776361909729_10154777317824729 | A few possibilities, is 1. he's just doing it because they found emails on Weiner's laptop and they just want to look like they're not hiding anything. 2. they've found a smoking gun, and he doesn't want to have to charge the POTUS-elect. 3. They want to take the heat off of her because of Wikileaks. Either way, she's the most corrupt woman in American history with bad judgement!
12 | David Velazquez Roa | 0 | 10154776361909729_10154777679814729 | I think Comey is trying to make himself the hero.  It is general protocol that investigations like these are not announced sixty days before an election.
13 | Debbie Leifheit | 1 | 10154776361909729_10154779065379729 | Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071. For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:‚Äú(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.‚ÄùYes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.
14 | Kay Batterbee Aupperle | 0 | 10154776361909729_10154778816154729 | Hillary has no one to blame but herself. She really has NO right to "demand" anything. She can not be above the law but must follow due process. I don't know how someone facing criminal charges is even allowed to run for office. The news reports say the evidence they've found is "significant" and will probably continue to mount.
15 | Daoowd Mardinly | 1 | 10154776361909729_10154777430789729 | She is liar corrupted thieve selling America to foriegn donors wall Street lobbies make arm deals for ISIS to get money in her pocket....

16 | Paolo Lim | 0 | 10154776361909729_10154776784644729 | So Washington Post, are you going to take your endorsement of her back since your coverage of her appears to incriminate her when we don't know much yet?
17 | Bruce Golland | 5 | 10154776361909729_10154776968239729 | The FBI director should be fired.He has disgraced the FBI!!!!!!!

19 | Constantine Angel Heiser | 2 | 10154776361909729_10154777089004729 | If you‚Äôve watched today‚Äôs events unfold and wondered why FBI Director James Comey was bending over backwards to dishonestly try to rig a Presidential race just eleven days before Election Day, it turns out you‚Äôre not the only one. Now that the media has independently confirmed Comey was being untruthful when he tried to create the appearance that he‚Äôs reopening his investigation of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails, there is already a DOJ criminal complaint moving forward against him. And now CNN is confirming that Comey has violated the policy of his own FBI.CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, who essentially speaks as the network‚Äôs de facto voice in legal matters, reported on-air on Friday evening that the FBI has an unwritten but absolute policy of not doing anything to interfere with Presidential elections in the final sixty days before Election Day. Comey clearly violated that policy today when he attempted to interfere with the election just eleven days out.
20 | Geoff Sherk | 0 | 10154776361909729_10154777405439729 | He said there appeared to be criminal intent last month. She is under criminal investigation for her use of an illegal email server, and the destruction of records and subpoenaed evidence. The FBI claimed there was no criminal intent, just gross negligence. It has since been proven that there was intent to destroy evidence and records, which changes things completely. The only reason none of Clinton's aides have been prosecuted is because they were granted immunity for some inexplicable reason. Obama is protecting her, because he is now implicated since it has come to light that he communicated with her over her illegal private server, and he lied about it. http://youtu.be/IP4EwuyyQAc

Her choice for 2nd in Command ...The Tim Kaine Resume is "impeccable" and also showing a long history of public service and public trust in the community ... Both Resumes are able to with stand any continuous assault upon their character ... And both Democratic Candidates gave full disclosure in releasing their tax returns ... While both Republican candidates did not give full disclosure to the American ppl and have yet to release their tax returns ... What more is the Republican candidate "HIDING" ... His amazing buildings u claim to have built have bankruptcy status which is still giving him a tax break while the little contractor who worked on the project has to wait for chapter11/13 to be paid ... #StillTheDemocratsHaveStrongestTicketinTheGame ...

24 | Frances Scott | 0 | 10154776361909729_10154779094899729 | Joe HallLooks like a classic case of Karma, reap what you sow, and you get back what you send out is about to happen right before our eyes. Remember, the tragedy of Benghazi happened right before 'the election" and Obama, Clinton, and Rice lied repeatedly about a video that caused a spontaneous attack...when it was a planned terrorist attack all along. Subsequently, Clinton denied any personal responsibility and said that this was not her ball to carry. Fast forward to the next election....and the mule is out of the barn and the crows are coming home to roost and lies about I didn't know 'C' meant classified and I never sent or received any classified information over my personal server and on one without a security clearance had access to my emails....will not nearly cut it this time. The Democrats own their rigged primary and Hillary Clinton and are about out of moves...and America will not stand for the election to be delayed or cancelled because this is not a conspiracy by any means...it is a mess that Hillary Clinton made on her own...and it stinks to high heaven...and she is just about ready to fall into it or be pushed into it!!
25 | Frances Scott | 0 | 10154776361909729_10154778277534729 | A Lie Named HillaryI don‚Äôt detest Hillary Clinton because she is a woman. I oppose her because she cannot tell the truth to save her life. Any public servant who has the gall to issue a list of terms the press cannot utter, as if disposing the corpse of free will, is helplessly deluded and a petulant child. Sorry, Hillary, but no one owes you anything; especially the nation you proclaim to serve with nothing but the benevolence of blind ambition. If your candidacy cannot survive without the aid of deception, division, and the fabricated catcalls of ‚Äúsexism‚Äù to demonize your critics, then please tell us why America needs you? Better yet, please explain how you‚Äôre even worthy of a job? A leader doesn‚Äôt need pollsters, a panel of advisors, two news conferences and a room full of media drones just to announce whether or not she used an unauthorized server to conduct official government business and therefore deleted emails in an attempt to avoid prosecution. A leader would never break the law in the first place. And a leader doesn't shout ‚Äúwhat does it matter‚Äù when four lives are lost in the wake of her unmitigated failure. Any self-respecting adult with an ounce of integrity would simply admit the truth. Excuse me, any self-aware child who knows the difference between right and wrong, life and death.  If I‚Äôm hiring someone to run my business, placing my future in foreign hands, I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican, a man or woman, white or black. I want the most qualified candidate whose character speaks for itself and whose ideals can stand on the merits of their own wisdom. That‚Äôs common sense. Are you going to have the audacity to tell me what I can and can‚Äôt ask; what verbiage is acceptable? If your resume and vision are truly best for the entire nation, not just one party, gender or race, either should be able to withstand the most blistering questions and exhaustive scrutiny. In fact, you should welcome any and all discourse to discredit your detractors and display your competence. A leader unites, empowers and inspires by example, not by excuses or endless blame. Tell me the national debt is a record 18 trillion and that Barack Obama has raised it more than the first 42 presidents combined. Admit that 93 million Americans are out of the workforce, nearly 50 million are on public assistance, and that the economic recovery is a sham. Admonish Iran as a destabilizing force of Islamic radicalism that must never be mentioned in the same sentence as ‚Äúnuclear power". Recognize the reality every civilized nation has immigration laws and that American sovereignty, the safety and security of her people, supersedes any political ploy to stuff the ballot box beneath the hollow cries of racism.   Yes, just like generations of legal immigrants before your candidacy, respect is given when trust is earned. If you are incapable of acknowledging simple, documented facts - solely because it‚Äôs easier to hide behind a propaganda platform that cajoles and incites an expendable public - you‚Äôre not interested in solving anything, let alone serving the American people or any notion of truth. You‚Äôre the cancer killing the country I love. You‚Äôre the lie my forefathers never told. Hillary if you have any love for our Nation please don't run, Obama has done enough damage already please don't finish America off. We can not stand another four years of decline we can only take so much before we will fail. At some time we the people will rise up and we will have a war that will make the Civil War look like child's play. FEEL FREE TO SHARE THIS EVERYWHERE WITH EVERY ONE ..

2 | Brendan McTear | 32 | 10154776577359729_10154776664659729 | Two years of a GOP witch hunt over Clinton's emails turned up NOTHING.  Why does the entire media buy into this notion that these new emails suddenly are going to be incriminating to Clinton.  What, did she make up some dastardly plan and put it all in an email form that she decided to hide on Weiner's phone?  This investigation will reveal nothing, as usual.
3 | Alan Carter | 9 | 10154776577359729_10154776748049729 | I must have drunk too much Kool-Aid‚Ñ¢. Cause none of this shit is going to get me to vote for Trump. Seriously, are there about 45 people still left that can't make up their damn minds one way or another?

I am heartbroken that so many people would rather stay ignorant to the truth and blindly follow Hilary and not read ONE DAMN EMAIL that was leaked!!! How can you love America & continue to support a woman who has sold our country out?!? HOW?!? This election has uncovered a lot of truth & so have these LEAKED EMAILS:: TRUTH that Hilary broke the law by having a server & having TOP SECRET, CLASSIFIED Information on her server; which she used BleachBit to wipe clean (not with a cloth!); Hilary had 13 devices (not one for convenience like she lied about) & confessed to smashing them with a hammer; she told the FBI that she didn't remember what Classified meant; that Hilary will LIE TO YOUR FACE while you bury your child that she helped kill in Benghazi; Hilary hates Catholics, Gays, Arabs, Bernie Supporters & blacks (those super predators); Obama made sure the FBI didn't indite Hilary & emailed her knowing she had a private email account-(proving he also broke the law & KNEW she was breaking the law!); had Bill Clinton secretly meet with the DOJ Loretta Lynch on the airport Tarmac which was NOT about discussing grandchildren for over 30 minutes; the State department tried to BRIBE the FBI to Declassify some of Hilary's emails; the DNC rigged the system & stole the election from Bernie; tried to ruin Trump with sexual allegations that couldn't be denounced and proven false in time before the election- KNOWING that such allegations would be harmful even though they were NOT TRUE & that she tried to destroy the women who made sexual assault allegations about her husband; the democrat party has set up people to fight at Trump rallies and to incite violence & have PAID THEM TO DO SO; Dead Democrats are voting & George Soros (who OWNS Hilary) is linked to voting machines in 16 states that have major electoral college counts; Hilary & Bill have sold out our country for MILLIONS of dollars to Countries that SHE KNEW WERE FUNDING ISIS!!!! How in the hell can you support the continued corruption in our government?!? If Hilary wins there will be NOTHING nor No branch of government to stop her!!! She has already proven that!!! Please take off your Republican & Democrat hat & start thinking like an American!!! This country is on her knees, with her head bent down and Hilary is holding the killing sword!!!! For the love of God----WAKE UP!!!!

1 | Kaitlyn Muchnok | 54 | 10154776355594729_10154776501044729 | Since when does the FBI report to congress? This is a disgusting , politically motivated witch hunt.
2 | Libby Carrier Hall | 43 | 10154776355594729_10154776581819729 | I am an American and am sick if this circus we call an election. Republicans are on a witch hunt that defies logic. I am insulted as a woman how you are and have treated a woman candidate. Any Woman candidate you would attack to achieve your repugnant quest for white male dominated power. I am woman Hear Me Roar! Listen carefully, there Will be more.
3 | Miriam Soler | 19 | 10154776355594729_10154776629294729 | Of course they are, they could have said it way before today, 11 days prior the Election Day, but they are wrong again, it wasn't her server and it wasn't her writing those emails.Plus we don't care one bit about more emails.I WILL VOTE FOR HILLARY!!!
4 | Carol Irion | 10 | 10154776355594729_10154776911879729 | NOTHING that Hillary Clinton could possibly do would result in my regretting that I voted for her!! This is just another attempt by the Republicans, with help from ratings/profit-hungry media, to change the discourse from Trump's disgusting behavior to Clinton. Way to go Comey!!
5 | C.T. Phantomband | 7 | 10154776355594729_10154777405599729 | Isn't it interesting how Hillary was investigated for months during a GOP witch hunt for her using a private server, when both Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice used one as well. Then they demonized her for deleted e-mails when Bush and Cheney deleted or lost 22 million. The leaked e-mails were acquired through illegal hacking and the hackers are still at roaming free. Now we hear that Comey notified the House Chairman, et al, because he feared a leak from the FBI to Congress. 1) This suggests how careless the FBI was in the original investigation vis a vis the leaked e-mails, 2) How inept they have been with the Weiner investigation, 3) How ineffective the agency has been preventing further computer hacks, such as those related to the DNC, 4) The extent to which a partisan Congress can undermine the FBI and put political pressure on one of our top law enforcement agencies, and subsequently undermine its ability to conduct unbiased investigations, 5) We have a federal agency director state that Clinton was sloppy with her classified e-mails, but allegedly he can't control the information that leaks from his own agency, 6) The timing of this notification is suspicious in and of itself, and it would seem thatthe agency needs to be investigated in relation to the timeline of when these e-mails were first discovered, and as to why they were not discovered previously, 7) why did the director write the letter in such a vague way and offer no context, which opens the door to speculation and spin. Without having specific details, Congress released this letter into the public domain fully well knowing it would create a whirlwind of speculation and controversy which could effect Hillary's campaign. Of course this is politics, but does that really justify their actions. This is undermining the FBI, which has incredibly dedicated agents who work tirelessly, and making them look bad. It makes the agency look unreliable when it comes to the control of information, which undermines Comey as well. I sincerely hope that he clears this mess up and nips things in the bud. I appreciate all the dedicated and hard work of the agency's field agents and forensic scientists. They do not deserve this cloud hanging over their heads. Their resources would be better spent addressing the hackers and protecting our IT infrastructure, especially from nefarious foreign influences.
6 | Tony Gutierrez | 8 | 10154776355594729_10154776652054729 | Director Comey's letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are, and the director himself notes they may not even be significant."
7 | Patrick Harvill | 4 | 10154776355594729_10154776498164729 | Trump is at 28% in California. The Clintons are Southwest Democratic Party politicians. Only 11 days out for more "scandal" that amounts to nothing and pro-GOP headlines and renewed malarkey from GOP talking points? Hillary Clinton in danger of having a closer election and being robbed of her Democratic Party Congress over nothing? The officials involved in this decision are going to go to work in mid-January and they are going to feel normal, until they realize that they're just a head rolling and they're on fire and everything's on fire.  Because they're in Hell.
8 | Carolyn Peterson | 6 | 10154776355594729_10154776820899729 | Come on, Comey. Since when does the FBI comment on an incomplete, ongoing investigation? And 11 days before an election that this disclosure could affect? Comey should be investigated
9 | Joseph Mack | 5 | 10154776355594729_10154776528819729 | Podesta concludes: "It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election."Ummmm, kinda like the timing on Trumps scandals with these women choosing to come forward now after all these years? Or the timing of the release of the tape?He's not wrong to question the timing, but in this God awful election these dirty politics are hardly a one way street.

Comey: ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.‚Äô‚Äô & "The FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant," Director Comey has a responsibility in this situation to say, okay my deputies that find all this information on Weiner‚Äôs computer, I have to study this information carefully ‚Äúmyself‚Äù before I could make any decision on them, and therefore could take his time till after the election for any correct decision making.I think President Obama should respond to his political move by his FBI Director very Forcefully and very Quickly.

How can you love America & continue to support a woman who has sold our country out?!? HOW?!? This election has uncovered a lot of truth & so have these LEAKED EMAILS:: TRUTH that Hilary broke the law by having a server & having TOP SECRET, CLASSIFIED Information on her server; which she used BleachBit to wipe clean (not with a cloth!); Hilary had 13 devices (not one for convenience like she lied about) & confessed to smashing them with a hammer; she told the FBI that she didn't remember what Classified meant; that Hilary will LIE TO YOUR FACE while you bury your child that she helped kill in Benghazi; Hilary hates Catholics, Gays, Arabs, Bernie Supporters & blacks (those super predators); Obama made sure the FBI didn't indite Hilary & emailed her knowing she had a private email account-(proving he also broke the law & KNEW she was breaking the law!); had Bill Clinton secretly meet with the DOJ Loretta Lynch on the airport Tarmac which was NOT about discussing grandchildren for over 30 minutes; the State department tried to BRIBE the FBI to Declassify some of Hilary's emails; the DNC rigged the system & stole the election from Bernie; tried to ruin Trump with sexual allegations that couldn't be denounced and proven false in time before the election- KNOWING that such allegations would be harmful even though they were NOT TRUE & that she tried to destroy the women who made sexual assault allegations about her husband; the democrat party has set up people to fight at Trump rallies and to incite violence & have PAID THEM TO DO SO; Dead Democrats are voting & George Soros (who OWNS Hilary) is linked to voting machines in 16 states that have major electoral college counts; Hilary & Bill have sold out our country for MILLIONS of dollars to Countries that SHE KNEW WERE FUNDING ISIS!!!! How in the hell can you support the continued corruption in our government?!? If Hilary wins there will be NOTHING nor No branch of government to stop her!!! She has already proven that!!! Please take off your Republican & Democrat hat & start thinking like an American!!! This country is on her knees, with her head bent down and Hilary is holding the killing sword!!!! For the love of God----WAKE UP!!!!

Use nuclear weapons. That means this election might have been affected by Weiner. He could cause the death of hundreds of thousands of people.
23 | Debbie Leifheit | 0 | 10154776355594729_10154779066559729 | Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071. For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:‚Äú(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.‚ÄùYes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.
