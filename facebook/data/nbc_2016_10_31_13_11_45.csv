When Linda Gottlieb hails a taxi cab in New York City and asks the driver to take her home, she has one word to describe how she feels: embarrassed.

Why? Because she has to tell the driver to take her to Trump Place.

2 | Robert Glennon | 20 | 1552808878072470_1552814861405205 | I'll give you 10 cent on the dollar for your place...you can then move to the Bronx 181 and Ryer...spare you all the embarrassment
3 | Lori Kotek Mount | 4 | 1552808878072470_1552821154737909 | He has always been crazy I guess that didn't bother her before. She can move if it bothers her so much. Not like she is on section 8 and needs the government to move her
4 | Tim Wenzel | 20 | 1552808878072470_1552810924738932 | I have a funny feeling that she has the means to move if she was really that embarrassed.
5 | Sam Congdon | 4 | 1552808878072470_1552831738070184 | You know, there's a lot of homeless veterans and homeless people in general who I'm sure would love the opportunity to complain about the name of the apartment building they live in because at least it's a roof over their heads. I'm not feeling particularly sympathetic towards complaints from someone who probably makes more in a month than I do all year.
6 | Debbie Mossey | 21 | 1552808878072470_1552813328072025 | NBC News .. this is not news. I don't even think the Enquirer or ET would run this.
7 | Susie Chaney | 2 | 1552808878072470_1552817621404929 | Knowing a man who thinks sexually harassing and groping women is his right and just a fun thing to do because he is rich. YEP would be embarrasing to be associated with Trump anything.
8 | Austin Eli | 13 | 1552808878072470_1552810688072289 | What is the point of this story..."I am embarrassed by the hotel I chose?"... she should get counseling...

12 | William Wolf | 1 | 1552808878072470_1552812494738775 | Not when the Chinese are buying his condos and co ops.Is NYC real estate tanking NBC??? lol lol lolCheap construction labor force in New York City is stronger than ever. This is not Trump's fault, or every other developers. This is our Labor Department's fault which is simply NOT doing its job. The Labor Dept does zero labor. Wake up sheep. Wake up NBC. Every time a "construction crew" does anything on your premises, INVESTIGATE, because the Labor Dept WILL NOT. NBC, you're a sick joke.For starters, do some investigative journalism (if you know what it is) on overtime pay. Open up your closed eyes and ears.I was fired from a construction company because the owner did not want to pay me for my overtime during Sunday. I called Eric Shneiderman's AG Albany office but as it turns out, he's busy "investigating" Trump. Eric, you amateur, don't expect my vote. Get a real job, a manly job, in the construction industry. Work for free. Call it: Community Service.This prune most likely lives on West End Ave, in the 60's. Trump's building. That's where my ex crook employer lives. I can see NJ from here.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | John Mathew | 34 | 1552781314741893_1552783871408304 | NBC got nothing but to influence Americans emotionally to hijack the election for the corrupt sell out of this country. Clinton and Obama created this refugee crisis and now we have to take the risk? Look at what is happening in France and Germany. Merrkel destroyed Germany. We need to ask rich Arab nations to give them safe places and culturaly that is best for these people.
2 | Sarah Haley Simon | 5 | 1552781314741893_1552799844740040 | I am sorry you lost your family members and for all of the hatred you endure from "The Greatest Country On Earth". I will be praying for you and your remaining family members.
3 | Margaret Leversuch | 0 | 1552781314741893_1552823118071046 | Just saw Judgement at Nuremberg. Nuremberg and Hamburg were bombed even worse than London. As a child I would hear the bombers on their way to Germany and #1 in my prayers was that they return safely. People should stay and rebuild a country.
4 | Maria Rapoport | 2 | 1552781314741893_1552818488071509 | What about talking about what is happening right here in our back yard . Please talk about Standing Rock , and the injustices committed not only against the Native Americans, but their allies . Please cover this story üôèüôèüôè
5 | Robert Differ | 3 | 1552781314741893_1552794664740558 | It started with Kuwait then Iraq Afghanistan then Syiria , down to Americans uk etc and all about oil . It's ok to say they should stay and fight but fight who there to many different factions . No, it's time America and uk accepted there responsibility and take in what you can and help others to poor to flee . We boambed them destroying there cities homes factory's schools . Stop propping up dictators .
6 | Tino Mayo | 4 | 1552781314741893_1552783974741627 | The sad reality is the PEOPLE of those countries should have come together to FIGHT ISIS with the military forces assisting to eradicate them. Instead of fleeing and leaving it to be everyone else's problem the residents should have fought back. I know it sounds heartless but its the truth. You cant expect the world to solve your countries problems.
7 | Chad Hance | 3 | 1552781314741893_1552805611406130 | This is just a fraction of the death and destruction due directly to Obama and Hillary policies.
8 | Denise Spencer | 8 | 1552781314741893_1552781644741860 | Trumps Foreign Policy:So Trump's policy is to whine and cry about ISIS and do the same thing that Obama is doing...except he wants to set up concentration camps in America and have his special panels decide if you have freedom or not....and he wants to spend a lot of money on the military that they say they don't need and we don't have because he wants to give all our money in tax cuts to oligarchs....all while he is buddy buddy with Putin telling us how great he is and suggesting NATO, Freedom, Liberty, and countries are up for grabs...and he thinks we should be using our military to invade and steal other countries oil for international oil cartels...He wants to commit war crimes and torture everyone and says torture works when the CIA says Nope.He wants to keep Gitmo open as a symbol that America Tortures POWs and commits war crimes at will.He wants to throw Americans in GITMO with no trial or due process.He speaks openly of using nuclear weapons.

More than a year after a grainy cellphone video shocked the nation, jury selection in the murder trial of a former South Carolina police officer who killed an unarmed black man is set to begin Monday.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sasha Bens | 63 | 1552745041412187_1552752014744823 | Police officers like this, give great, honest police officers a bad name, and at times, make their job harder then it has to be. It's so disappointing.
2 | Jessie Jackson | 22 | 1552745041412187_1552759508077407 | I was wondering how long these murder cases was going stay I the background....this should be a quick factual conviction...but with global white supremacy ...we know how it will probably turn out
3 | Aeren Martinez | 13 | 1552745041412187_1552760568077301 | Every time I see this video I only get more angry. Before the Bundy trial I would have said they have a slam-dunk case against the cop, but now I question whether any real justice is possible.
4 | Sean John | 2 | 1552745041412187_1552774028075955 | Accountability!!!!!!!!!!!!! If we do not get on the phone, write letters, who are we fooling, this will continue. Having a casual conversation on social media won't help him or the next victim who might not have a video. We are held accountable, they must be also held accountable even more so because our taxes votes give them the ability. It's time to restructure their role in our community or fire the department.
5 | David Wajda | 2 | 1552745041412187_1552752714744753 | O! So against what all the SJWs are trying to shove down my throat, this cop is going to trial for shooting an unarmed man? Hmmm, another myth dispelled
6 | Ben Thigpen | 0 | 1552745041412187_1552818524738172 | For all the comments by the racist democrats. I am a white Trump supporter. I believe this man broke the law. But the law he broke did not carry the death penalty with it. I don't know anyone that supports this kind of behavior. I hope the former officer has to answer in full. So please stow the small minded racism!
7 | Trina Brady | 0 | 1552745041412187_1552828991403792 | Not that I am saying it justifies the shooting but everyone seems to leave out that part about Scott having vague information about whether he owned the car or had insurance and that he ran from the traffic stop because of a bench warrant for his arrest.
8 | Anthony Howard | 10 | 1552745041412187_1552754498077908 | I stand by the police, but this murderer deserves to fry
9 | Les Brown | 3 | 1552745041412187_1552762081410483 | There is good and bad in all groups in life this man is clearly guilty with enough video to back it up, Just like the Clinton videos she guilty to.
10 | Deb Wood | 1 | 1552745041412187_1552791128074245 | Why did the guy in the green shirt jump outta his car and run? Oh yeah, he had broken the law....just sayin...
11 | Anda Glend | 0 | 1552745041412187_1552778001408891 | if the man killed was my familly i will spend my whole life taking down that officer's familly members that way the police will think twice before killing someone like that
12 | Doug Lambert | 1 | 1552745041412187_1552781614741863 | Occurred in April 2015. Yet, in Chicago, CPD Officer Jason Van Dyke still hasn't gone to trial over a retreating suspect he shot 16 times a full year earlier.
13 | ÿ¥Ÿäÿ®ÿ±ÿØ ÿ®ŸäŸÑ | 4 | 1552745041412187_1552756581411033 | Where are all the wingnutt blue lives matter people with their "He should of complied" comments?
14 | Stanley Adams | 3 | 1552745041412187_1552763841410307 | A life sentence without the possibility of parole would be great for him.
15 | ÿ¥Ÿäÿ®ÿ±ÿØ ÿ®ŸäŸÑ | 2 | 1552745041412187_1552767481409943 | I bet this happened millions of times without consequences before the cellphone was invented.
16 | Ulises Lolo Ramirez | 5 | 1552745041412187_1552753778077980 | LOL @ grainy cellphone video.!!!! I saw the vid, and it was crystal clear to me.!!!
17 | Cassie Lockhart | 2 | 1552745041412187_1552767658076592 | I'm glad he was charged but he won't be convicted.  They never are.  That's why they feel safe abusing their power.
18 | Gary Basham | 3 | 1552745041412187_1552769688076389 | I just came here to see racist Trump supporters blame the victim.
19 | Sable Hall | 1 | 1552745041412187_1552777721408919 | Why do our officers not have the same rules of engagement our military has..? Especially when they have military equipment.
20 | Brenda Bethel | 1 | 1552745041412187_1552763964743628 | I also hope for justice. This was horrific. The police officer has a lot of explaining to do.
21 | Kevin Miskell | 3 | 1552745041412187_1552760824743942 | guilty for sure kill some body like a sissy. wasn't threatening your life.
22 | Denise Spencer | 12 | 1552745041412187_1552747778078580 | Black Lives MattersNo justice No Peace....Republican policy has made police into an occupying force to suppress minority Americans and take the rights to vote away from them so they can maintain power. It is republican and conservative racists policies and rhetoric that has led to targeting of minorities, and the racists incarceration rates from a republican drug war.... and pulling over black and brown Americans and harassing them and running their departments off of fining or jailing them... Republicans should get the blow back, not the cops. It is republican policy pushed by a tough on crime rhetoric that is responsible. Both sides are not equal regardless of the 96 Clinton Crime Bill that was that was a small part of republicans tough on crime policy for decades over a made up drug war.
23 | Lee Smith | 8 | 1552745041412187_1552749921411699 | I am glad there was video taken....
24 | Brian Caswell | 0 | 1552745041412187_1552768344743190 | Again these slimball lawers trying there best to vilify the VICTIM. I wonder how these people are able to sleep at night.
25 | John Weissensel | 1 | 1552745041412187_1552769118076446 | Maybe if Scott didn't resist arrest, he would still be alive..

4 | Richard M. Braun | 115 | 1552674058085952_1552686268084731 | No it won't affect me. The lawless, corrupt Comey only reinforced my absolute and unshakeable faith in Hillary Clinton, the next president.
5 | Trina Gavagan | 90 | 1552674058085952_1552676128085745 | It's a frantic attempt to aid and abet Trump. There's still the Trump University class action lawsuit starting on 11/28, his child rape trial with his convicted child rapist billionaire buddy Jeff Epstein starting on 12/16, the FBI's current investigation for his ties to Russia, his Mar a Lago insurance fraud investigation, his 12 and counting sexual assault cases, his unregistered fake foundation, and the 1000s of other lawsuits pending against him. I would be sickened to see a p***y grabbing, racist, reality TV pseudo celebrity sitting in the Oval Office.
6 | Timothy Vandyk | 90 | 1552674058085952_1552674748085883 | Wow! Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder, and Harry Reid, three of the most corrupt and divisive figures in our nation‚Äôs history, complaining about the email investigation. Absolutely laughable.
7 | Randy Adkinson | 75 | 1552674058085952_1552674678085890 | If you are still undecided, please consider Rick Astley. He will never give you up, let you down, run around, desert you, make you cry, say goodbye, tell a lie, or hurt you.
8 | Mark Sugimoto | 35 | 1552674058085952_1552676271419064 | It has gotten to the point where corruption in our political system is ignored and accepted. Everyday from the president on down they show what corrupt liars they are and none of these politicians can be trusted.
9 | Ben Pike | 41 | 1552674058085952_1552677081418983 | I don't think it will make a huge difference at this point. The same people who didn't care about the emails before, aren't going to care now. There are 8 days to go...people aren't going to change their minds.
10 | Rin Kate Watt | 24 | 1552674058085952_1552737874746237 | Unless Clinton's emails reveal that she molested a dozen men, cheated on 3 spouses, is facing a rape case in December, is facing a fraud case in November for ripping off students, has bullied hundreds of contractors and workers into accepting half what they were promised, mocked a handicapped man, threatened to punish women who get abortions, profited off a charity and used its money to bribe two attorneys general, and developed an oddly cozy and sycophantish relationship with a foreign leader who's trying to alter the course of our election,  I'm sticking with Hillary.
11 | Rachael Calkins | 13 | 1552674058085952_1552694388083919 | And as his first order of business in office, Trump plans to sue the women whom he sexually assaulted which is also a crime. Why are leaked emails which didn't contain vital information more damming to a campaign than an assault on another human being? Riddle me that pro-life-ers.
12 | Tim Grills | 15 | 1552674058085952_1552695618083796 | It's only a "bombshell" because YOU are making it appear to be. Why weren't the investigations into Trumps ties to Russia,  Trumps bribe to the Florida AG, and Trumps foundation revealed?
13 | Don Russo | 7 | 1552674058085952_1256226831064099 | Question: So if Comey violated the Hatch Act because he was using his power to influence the Presidential election. Doesn't the current President do the same by campaigning for a nominee using government funds to travel around the country?  Truly confused about the difference. Isn't Obama trying to influence the election, and isn't he using Government resources in the shape of Air Force One, etc?
14 | Matt Stricker | 13 | 1552674058085952_1552713168082041 | I'M VOTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON!I don't care about the scandals surrounding her and Bill since he was governor of Ark. I don't care that people with damaging info on the Clintons died mysteriously. I don't care that Bill Clinton is a rapist. I don't care that as secretary of state she gave weapons contracts to countries that made huge donations to the Clinton Foundation.I don't care that she has received millions from Islamic countries that abuse women and behead Christians and gays. I don't care that she was indecisive on providing adequate protection for the embassy in Benghazi resulting in the death of four Americans.I don't care that she says unborn children have no rights.And I certainly don't care that she had a private server that she used to email classified info through and then had her lawyers wipe it clean to hide evidence. . actually I do care and that is why I‚Äôm voting for TRUMP!!
15 | Patti Cravero Scott | 10 | 1552674058085952_1552696948083663 | There was a comment I read yesterday that had interesting facts. Trump brought Weiner up last summer, on or around 10/26th  Giuliani said on several national networks that something big was going to break that was going to blow Hillary out of the water (paraphrased) within next 24 hrs. Comey apparently got info on 27th about computer belonging to Weiner, made statement/letter to Congress on 28th. This weekend Trump said that he told them to ck Weiner's computer. If Russia/Wikileaks can hack into all these emails, can they plant emails on a computer? Just a thought, please no nasty comments. Doesn't anyone feel angry about Russia interfering with our American election, no matter who you support?
16 | TerriAnn Clidence Arrington | 21 | 1552674058085952_1552676998085658 | Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:‚Äú(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.‚ÄùYes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.CC/PASTED
17 | Cecilia Sanchez | 10 | 1552674058085952_1552717244748300 | Isn't it interesting that they've been investigating Weiner for ages, and now Comey decides to say there are not Clinton emails on his server, but her aide's emails? This is an obvious move by Comey to get Trump elected!
18 | Nas Nasir | 12 | 1552674058085952_1552675481419143 | This whole situation is an embarrassment from both sides.  If it was some other Democrat running against Trump, Trump would be losing by a land slide.  If Hillary was running against another Republican, she would be losing by a land side.Blame deplorable democrats and republicans for nominating these two idiots.
19 | Lisa Plowman | 16 | 1552674058085952_1552682081418483 | Endlessly knawing on this issue is clearly the only chance Trump and the Republicans have at winning.  Even if I weren't "with her" I would still take the emailgate over Trump's mountainous skullduggery...
20 | Amber Lampes | 8 | 1552674058085952_1552704338082924 | If Hillary wins, and it's definitely a possibility, she will be a lame duck from day one, potentially impeached, and certainly cause a constitutional crisis. Add in her anti-Russo fetishism, and we very well might be plunged into a war.
21 | Mustafe M Osman | 9 | 1552674058085952_1552684664751558 | Comey just lost his mind by going against the Hatch Act!!! The DOJ told him to sit on it until they had more information. He didn't and he is actions violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. What exactly is the Hatch Act? The Hatch Act is a federal law that was passed in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to limit federal agencies or its employees from interfering with political activities or federally funded programs.
22 | Joanne Van Dyke | 10 | 1552674058085952_1552699664750058 | I'm actually shocked! Shocked that the FBI or specifically Comey broke Hatch law by getting involved in this election! Boy somebody paid someone to send out this memo !
23 | Laura Catherine Welch | 7 | 1552674058085952_1552691894750835 | Trump may very well become president because "for profit journalism" failed our country. You are sensationalizing Comey's letter without emphasizing that the e-mails in question were found on the computer of a disgraced politician (Weiner) who is under investigation for sexting to a minor. You report shallow, insinuating headlines with no substance that hurt Clinton's campaign. In the meantime, while there is a focus on Trump's character flaws, nothing is reported about the facts that he is being investigated by the FBI for his shady links to Russia, the facts that he will be appearing in court for rape and for the "Trump University" fiasco, and the facts that he has spent years ripping off contractors and investors in order to enrich himself without risk. I hope your pay is worth it. At least you can all afford to visit countries that actually have journalists who serve theirs.
24 | LaVondra Harris | 1 | 1552674058085952_1552732548080103 | Our great country deserves better presidential candidates and we shouldn't let the Olivia Popes (Scandal) of the world distract us from actual issues (economy, defense, mistrust among some people and law enforcement, young kids being killed for no reason, etc). IMO, the FBI is trying to show it's not biased.   Weird how the 9/11 commission didn't find links to B. Clinton or G.W. Bush and I think that was because it was partisan/biased.   Hopefully, Clinton-Kaine will still win and the FBI's actions will set a lasting positive precedent.    I kind of wish that part of the corrupt Bush administration had done like the FBI now.   http://www.newscorpse.com/ncWP/?p=29614
25 | Vicky Fratus | 11 | 1552674058085952_1552694491417242 | I was dodging sniper fire while on my way to a shovel ready job I was promised, when I heard the FBI re-opened the investigation into Hillary's emails. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs just silly,‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúEveryone knows it was a YouTube video that caused all this mess.‚Äù Poor Hillary. She just can‚Äôt get a break. Remember how she and her husband left the White House flat broke? I bet she thought she could keep her doctor if she liked her doctor too. Why, they‚Äôve had to work real hard to make ends meet between giving speeches for $250,000 or more and all the charity work at the Foundation. I've heard Haiti loves the Clintons. Anyway, it‚Äôs just tough being Hillary - named after that famous mountain climber, you know. But really, folks, at this point what difference does it make? She‚Äôs admitted to not being technically gifted. She tried wiping her server with a cloth, what more can we ask of her? It‚Äôs not like anyone died under her watch, right?

2 | Rav Singh | 8 | 1552647491421942_1552649461421745 | The Democrats blamed their corruption on a right-wing conspiracy, then when some proof was revealed in their own correspondence, they blamed their corruption on a Russian conspiracy and now they blame their corruption on an FBI conspiracy. So what's next to cover their corruption and lies? Blaming it all on the right-wing, Russians, and FBI all colluding against them? Lie, deny, blame, repeat is all we get from liberals. It's quite the spectacle.

Is election fatigue killing Black Friday? Or will you need retail therapy after this campaign?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jonathan  Brodeur  | 26 | 1552620891424602_1552636424756382 | I think Black Friday is depressing.  Watching people get trampled, arrested, killed, in fights over things that will eventually end up in the trash or the attic.  I wish we could take all the passion that goes into fighting over worthless things and transfer it into something  meaningful like feeding the homeless, providing Christmas for families in need, the list goes on.
2 | Alex Warrington | 22 | 1552620891424602_1552625591424132 | It's dead. I can pick up a couple good deals after the initial rush. But mainly I sit on Amazon and get the lightning deals much cheaper than local stores.Needed a 32 inch TV for the kid. Target/Walmart $140-150, Amazon $75 shipped.
3 | Phillip Borgia | 25 | 1552620891424602_1552622574757767 | I'd rather be at home in the middle of a food coma than be potentially molested by 30 different people fighting over a blender.
4 | Douglas Brantley | 18 | 1552620891424602_1552631168090241 | It's a national day of embarrassment. Hope it's dead. Hordes of people trampling each other for cheap consumer goods? Freaking disgusting.
5 | Ronnie Epstein Bach | 1 | 1552620891424602_1552786358074722 | Black friday very overrated. I wait till a decent hour and then if I need something  go out other wise forget it. You can always get want you want for a good deal if you look around especially on line. Just sayin.
6 | John R. Sherwood | 5 | 1552620891424602_1552631478090210 | If hillary is elected, black friday will die because money will go to more free healthcare and free college...Matter of fact every holiday will be dead at that point.
7 | Gearld Sims | 0 | 1552620891424602_1552630671423624 | I like Black Friday. So many fights and agruements to watch. I use Black Friday to stock on winter gear. Kohl's and other store usually have some nice coats on sale that no one buys. :)
8 | Sandi Snook Hausner | 1 | 1552620891424602_1552673004752724 | Election fatigue has definitely set in. But retail therapy isn't my thing. Like a friend of mine always says, "you can go broke at a sale".
9 | Maria Rapoport | 1 | 1552620891424602_1552819904738034 | Why are you talking about something so superficial as this story , and not about Standing Rock and all the injustices committed against our Native Americans and their allies .

10 | Lydja Dawson Urban | 0 | 1552620891424602_1552737734746251 | No. It is dead, at least for us.   Our holidays are cash only nowadays. That cash is what we manage to collect after living expenses are all covered. There isn't a whole heck of a lot.
11 | William Harden | 0 | 1552620891424602_1552775804742444 | I think black lives matter "protesters" and those who fight during Black Friday "shopping" are the same people. Just my opinion.
12 | Stan Gilbert | 1 | 1552620891424602_1552737941412897 | Everyday online is BLACK FRIDAY ... And its realy time we STOP CALLING it "Black" Anything. You find more deals online, at the same or cheaper prices, you don't have to get up and rush to a store at midnight, stand in line until 5AM where the store only has 10 of th e item you want any way and you are 50th inline. You can buy online, have it wrapped it you want providing the offere the service and have it shipped to yout front door, let the mailman, UPS or Fedex struggle with it up to that point., you can even shop online in your jammies, or nothing at all.Ahhhh, the Internet makes shopping so easy.

The reality is someone will be voted in - while the indigenous people of our country are being abused, ignored, yet again having their rights and lands desecrated. Why don't you get news crews out there to show THE NATION what the world has already commented on. We fight in other countries for a people's rights - and carry on this nastiness in our back yard. Yet Americans get angry when someone kneels during the national anthem?! What hypocrisy. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1336613203035896&id=1090183327678886

Halloween horror: the backstage and onscreen lives of Boris Karloff
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Vincent Lanzetta Tripoli | 1 | 1552590561427635_1552723421414349 | Back in the late 40s, early 50s, my in-laws ran a resort hotel complex in The Virgin Islands, where many movie stars would go to "get away from it all"!  I once asked my mother-in-law "who was the nicest of the ones you met"?  She answered " the sweetest, kindest, most gentle man I met there, was BORIS KARLOFF"!  I said ... "Frankenstein's Monster ... The Mummy ... are YOU KIDDING ..."?!!

Condensing Donald Trump‚Äôs worldview into one sentence is tough. But this might come close...
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jeff Price | 816 | 1552532861433405_1552535751433116 | Yawn, how about more about the candidate under federal investigation yet again?? I can't believe I'm saying this. The candidate under federal investigation again. If she is elected she will be impeached quicker then Billy boy was. Unreal people still support her.. Unreal.
2 | Jay Harvanek | 480 | 1552532861433405_1552535384766486 | NBC we all know you're in the tank for Hillary. Glad that you're not trying to hide your bias anymore.
3 | Rob Maynard | 448 | 1552532861433405_1552537328099625 | NBC why arent doing a piece on Hillary' world? Something like how much money would have to be donated to her Clinton Foundation before she helps a nation in need. Or how she promises equal pay but pays the woman on her staff  $4k less a year than her male counter parts. How can she give equal pay to Americans if she can't equally pay her own staff?Or how about her illegal dealings with backroom servers so no one can see her shady practices.
4 | Sarah Sprague | 263 | 1552532861433405_1552538651432826 | But he was correct in those "conspiracy theories" and he isn't the one who put our National security at risk. You should really try informing people of the actual news and not just your opinion.
5 | Stephen Rosenberg | 217 | 1552532861433405_1552538101432881 | This goes beyond temperamentally unfit, this goes into pure hate and disgust for your fellow man! America is not a vengeful nation, we are a caring nation of protection, acceptance, love leadership. Why are we allowing a reality television personality lead us into a universe of upheaval and unrest!! Everything in the article tells us why we have to run from him, he is the enemy he would be the downfall of our great country!!
6 | Angela Virtudazo | 135 | 1552532861433405_1552540808099277 | Completely unqualified. Utterly lacking in needed skills and temperament. His resume would be rejected by any sensible HR department.
7 | Tom Lacerte | 184 | 1552532861433405_1552534694766555 | The Clinton campaign pays liberal trouble-makers to start fights at Trump rallies.
8 | Jenny Wood Bagley | 98 | 1552532861433405_1552540688099289 | trump sucks. He is nucking futs and lacks basic common sense, like 99% of his supporters, who are to ignorant to realize he is feeding on your fears to try and get something he can't get on his own.
9 | Lori Miller Kovacs | 71 | 1552532861433405_1552547181431973 | The next article I expect NBC news to publish better be "The lying, hatefulness of Hillary Clinton and why it matters". Unbiased media should publish negative views on both candidates. Oh wait, that doesn't exist anymore. üò°
10 | Chinomnso Awazie | 71 | 1552532861433405_1552542461432445 | It's a major blow to American image worldwide that a misogynistic racist tax evader like Trump, who displays appalling lack of understanding of how the world works and roams around by 3:00am tweeting horrible things about women and asking folks to watch porn can be nominated as a candidate of a major party! All he does is dog whistle politics as shown by a recent research that over a third of his followers on Twitter follow one or more white supremacists. This guy has taken America so backwards by bringing mainstream vile behaviors and attitudes that everyone thought have been overcome or subdued at least.In a show of solidarity with bad actions, this guy keeps comparing his winning to Britexit, same Britexit the Brits are so regretting that they want a do over to correct it..... same Britexit that's another sterling example of the West showing they ain't smart after all! That's the brand he's selling his candidacy on????Americans have a chance to set the records straight by giving this guy a resounding defeat come November 8, and showing the rest of the world that this is not what American is. Actually, what needs to be made great again is congress that has moved away from pursuing the needs of those who voted them in to pursuing personal political ambitions.
11 | Sandra Marv | 66 | 1552532861433405_1552546078098750 | Yeah. Dodged the draft 5 times Doesn't pay taxes. Clogs up the judicial system by being sued and with his own frivolous lawsuits and bankruptcies. Protected by our military. Uses our roads and infrastructure. Has never ONCE served public interests or given to a legitimate charity. CHEATS on everything including his wives. ..That's a small start
12 | Debbie Kranzdorf | 38 | 1552532861433405_1552556591431032 | I honestly believe Donald Trump is suffering from a serious mental illness, above and beyond the narcissism spoken of so often. His behavior and attitude is just not stable and sane. Perhaps it's a form of dementia as he repeats himself so much and has such a poor grasp of the English language beyond the most simple of words. It's either that or he's just plain evil. Either way, we cannot afford to have such an ignorant and out-of-control individual in the Oval Office.
13 | Charie Miller | 29 | 1552532861433405_1552571678096190 | Your header is misleading. Vengeful, really? Hillary is her own worst enemy. She's the dishonest one. How bout do your job and report on what a crook she has been to so many? What a novel idea.
14 | April Ennis-Pierson | 43 | 1552532861433405_1552548671431824 | NBC! You are a despicable !!!!! Your biased, sensationalized journalism is an example of what is deplorable in this election.  Gross
15 | Tommy Waller | 50 | 1552532861433405_1552540261432665 | more liberal media bias,for the second time in one year she is under F.B.I. investigation , and you still won't talk about it, the woman blaming Russia for everything and your trying to say Trump is a warmonger, we have been in the longest war in American history, with her as Sec.of State for most of it, you people are in such denial, or your in bed with her one
16 | Dave DiBiase | 36 | 1552532861433405_1552538868099471 | NBC: You call it vengeful because it fits your agenda against Trump and it's an attempt to steer away from Hillary's corruption laid bare for the world to see.  I call it competitive.  The only way as Teddy Roosevelt said to walk softly and carry a big stick is to make sure make sure everybody knows that you have a big stick and are willing to use it.  Get back on the news if the day and stop trying to change the narrative.  The laptop, national security and what the FBI is going to do.  Cronkite, Russert, Woodward, Bernstein would never have tried to change the narrative.
17 | Greg Pitts | 44 | 1552532861433405_1552540811432610 | NBC, writing a fantasy novel instead of reporting the news. All you do is spread lies and misinformation. Only ignorant fools could support Hillary Clinton, and here you are, supporting her.
18 | Donny Brown | 33 | 1552532861433405_1552558314764193 | Great piece. What bothers me IS how biased this network and other like you have been. I consider myself an independent. I vote based on what research I have done on the individual not what a news outlet reports. Having said that. Clinton is one of the most corrupt politicians I have ever seen. Benghazi turned me against her. Her lies. She has no heart. At least when you see Trump speak you can see it is in his heart. She relies on speech writers because she can't speak to the little people. She is trash. I would vote for anyone other than her.
19 | Jim Gavin | 43 | 1552532861433405_1552538398099518 | Really?? How bias can you be main stream...Hiliary is under investigation by the FBI...That is nuts... UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI let that sink in, If this were Trump you would be all over it saying he has to drop out...very sad how you are trying to rig the election instead of providing the American voters Journalism.
20 | Tina Gibby | 15 | 1552532861433405_1552601504759874 | You think all these stations realize that they are losing all respect and credibility and in 9 days when TRUMP is elected the people won't forget how bias and unreliable they are ?? #newsSpreadsHateForRatings
21 | Cory Matos | 19 | 1552532861433405_1552589778094380 | It's amazing that they say a Trump presidency will take us back. Take us back where?? To a time when Americans mattered? a time when there were jobs available and not taken by foreign workers? A time when education was great and schools not over crowded? A time when no one was offended? a time when parents were the parents and not society? I have been a Democrat all my life but that doesn't mean I have to agree or like the nominee that was chosen. I'm all for change but not all change is good.
22 | Lisa Gould-Smith | 19 | 1552532861433405_1552596428093715 | So NBC your saying...this doesn't happen? This is happening and it may become worse under Hillary. Ohh that's right you want Hillary! Biased media. Listen, he will win and when he does fix alot of things that need to be done or should of been done that hadn't been done for years..he will be a great president give him a chance. She on the other hand has no agenda to make it her own. If she would of been saying I'm gonna Change things for the better instead she keeps saying she wants to continue the Obama way. We don't want another 4 freaking years of Obama anything. She will do what ever the people pay her to do. We need someone who is gonna take charge and have there own ideas. She's not presidential in my eyes just a follower not a leader. She a crook and liar. Who they hell would want thst running our country. Not me.
23 | Betty Lamp | 22 | 1552532861433405_1552563991430292 | Vengeful. Really? How about the long long list of people who crossed paths with the Clinton's over the years who end up mysteriously DEAD? Now!!! Now we see a file saved on a laptop with 650,000 emails in it! This file is labeled 'insurance policy'. Why do you think it's labeled that considering the long list of dead bodies in the wake of the Clinton's? You wait! These emails will be DAMNING! And the FBI better be protection Huma and Anthony or the will end up like the rest of the people who crossed the Clinton Mafia!
24 | Annie C. Galloza | 28 | 1552532861433405_1552537174766307 | Next thing you know, NBC News will say that Trump is about to take down The Avengers! LOL! POS Journalism!!!
25 | Rhonda Gearsbeck Solon | 20 | 1552532861433405_1552548751431816 | Still grasping to change our votes! Trump is right , media is just a bunch of corrupt waste of time!! Trying to control the outcome of the election! The journalist who cam before you are rolling in their graves in disgust !!!

At the heart of the 322-year-old missing persons case is a king of England, the wife he locked up for 30 years and her lover, a handsome Swedish count who disappeared in 1694.

2 | Joneisha Sams | 54 | 1552216388131719_1552217671464924 | How did an article about 300 year old skeletons turn into a political debate about Trump and Clinton?
3 | Jillian McCormick | 33 | 1552216388131719_1552231074796917 | Gaaaah! Can we just have one comment thread that doesn't devolve into politics?!
4 | Melanie Nicole Brewster | 34 | 1552216388131719_1552240094796015 | Dear NBC I'd like you to know what is happening in North Dakota is not only sickening but in basic terms an act of war. The same act of war that our natives in South Dakota fought against in 2014 with the Keystone XL pipeline. The 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty was a government solution to give our natives land in order to allow settlers safe passage across the area and to establish peace among the tribes. This land is not ours to take and sell regardless of the price that big oil is willing to pay. Our natives have suffered enough throughout their history. And by dishonoring our treaty that is an act of war against our own people and the true founders of this nation. I urged you, NBC, to help spread the word to prevent the further bloodshed of our Native American brothers and sisters. I myself am not of Native decent but I was there in New Orleans for the BP Oil spill that devastated our economy, killed our wildlife, and poisoned our oceans. It is time for America to realize that oil is no longer a worthy investment. The supply cannot meet our demands much longer and it is destroying the beautiful earth we inhabit. Let's stop making the same mistakes throughout history. Let us protect our people with honor and our earth with pride.Water is life.
5 | Debra Benyshek | 12 | 1552216388131719_1552241708129187 | Unsolved mysteries are kind of cool. Unearthed bones, cars with people in them and other things found in a dried up lake, ect.
6 | Christie DeBerry | 5 | 1552216388131719_1552301044789920 | NBC how about getting around to what is happening right now, in this century, in THIS country. Get to talking about Standing Rock, and the brutality that is going on right now. Don't wait for it to become a 3,000 year old, unsolved mystery. #NoDAPL
7 | Pat Stevens | 3 | 1552216388131719_1552367404783284 | A better history lesson NBC would be to talk about King Louie and Marie Antoinette, who they were and what happened when they screwed their loyal subjects. Try highlighting the French Revolution and what happened to them afterwards.
8 | Susan Brewer | 2 | 1552216388131719_1552679601418731 | History is always fascinating.  The queen was locked up for thirty years because the church wouldn't give him a divorce. Politics!!!

JUST IN: FBI obtains warrant to further investigate emails linked to Clinton server probe, as Sen. Harry Reid accuses Director Comey of violating Hatch Act
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Micheal Rogers | 2712 | 1552140754805949_1552144538138904 | "I was going to vote for Clinton, but now that emails are back, I'm going to vote for the dumb, rapist sociopath"  - Said no one ever. #ImWithHer
2 | Christina Kook | 986 | 1552140754805949_1552142154805809 | The best gift Democrats can give to Republicans is to defeat them soundly and take back the Senate at a minimum. "Our system would then be returned to balance, and the public trust in our government would be restored. A landslide defeat of Trump would not only dispatch with a dangerous demagogue, but it would also go a long way toward restoring the proper functioning of our democracy."
3 | Bobbie Liegus | 697 | 1552140754805949_1552144761472215 | nothing in these emails will reveal anything that hasn't been revealed before...in other words, it's a wild goose chase...sadly for Republicans...
4 | Bill Teichgraber | 414 | 1552140754805949_1552149934805031 | HRC is not a victim. HRC is a career felon. It's not the FBI who are to blame. It is HRC and her supporting cast at the DNC who need to take responsibility for their compromises, lack of transparency and active engagement in criminal enterprises. What's the plan from the playbook now? Search: "What do rats do when a ship begins to take on water?"
5 | Anthony Mike | 394 | 1552140754805949_1552142974805727 | Here let me put it into little boy words for you..Would you allow your mechanic neighbor to perform open heart surgery on you? I think not, but you would elect a POTUS based on no experience, no plan and just vitriol and rhetoric? That kind of makes you dumb and not me. Weiner who is the "flag word" in this investigation was not sending dick pics to Hillary and is a moot point....we all know from recent events that he prefers 17 year old blonde girls
6 | Mitchel Betts | 260 | 1552140754805949_1552145768138781 | Good because that's the only thing that the Republican party has against Hillary Clinton is her emails that's it that's the only thing they can find on her is her emails and thats it she will be our next president no matter what the situation is. And if you think Donald Trump really cares about the American people you better think again the man has the money now he just wants to power nothing more and nothing less. Isis is just another name for Al-Qaeda they have been here way before the Obama Administration way before the Bush Administration even before the other Clinton and the other Bush Administration come on now think about it y'all
7 | Matthew Sahag√∫n | 173 | 1552140754805949_1552145844805440 | Comey needs to step down, if you say you did an investigation, THEN DO ONE, and do it correct the first and only time. If you come back and re open a case that you closed then it looks bad on your judgement and decision making. This is ridiculous and is symbolic of everything wrong with the criminal justice system. Leadership is an uncommon trait found within Washington.
8 | Sandra Marv | 186 | 1552140754805949_1552146891472002 | So the FBI Director sent this bombshell letter stating that they are reviewing emails to see if they are pertinent to the investigation last week, but they haven't even seen them??? And only today is when they got the warrant to look at the Emails??? What kind of corrupt legal system is that??? Trump is right, that it is a rigged system. But it is the FBI Director trying to rig the election in his favor. Comey has lost all credibility and should step down...his career is flushed.
9 | Usman Okai Austin | 120 | 1552140754805949_1552155224804502 | No serious person will vote for terrorist called Hillary Clinton .

11 | Brett Gilbert | 98 | 1552140754805949_1552152488138109 | Funny how just a short time ago Democrats were praising Comey...  now they're coming unglued...  here's an idea... don't be a criminal and you won't get investigated by the FBI....

13 | Diane Miller Fuller | 55 | 1552140754805949_1552157968137561 | If you take a step back from tribal politics, you‚Äôll see that Mrs. Clinton has clearly disqualified herself from ever coming near classified information again. If she were a young person straight out of grad school hoping to land a government job, Hillary Clinton would be laughed out of Washington with her record. She‚Äôd never be hired.So how is she allowed to run for POTUS?
14 | Dave Arber Jr. | 55 | 1552140754805949_1552158531470838 | This is what happens when you go ahead and nominate a person under an FBI investigation. It can be reopened at any time pending new information, which is why they WERE ABLE to obtain a new search warrant. An election date has no bearing on justice...
15 | Krysta Marberry | 32 | 1552140754805949_1809034642645406 | Folks when the FBI obtains a warrant it's not for some silly reason. They must have found something. Everyone needs to calm down and let the FBI do their job. The fact that Harry Reid doesn't like what James Comey is doing the right thing.
16 | Nick Hawk DeMeo | 35 | 1552140754805949_1809033355978868 | Trump: the system is riggedHillary supporters: shut up your just mad cause your losing.Fbi: evidence reveals deeper threats lay in emails, we are opening the investigation.Hillary supporters: the system is rigged.

17 | Becky Johnson | 37 | 1552140754805949_1552171914802833 | clinton has hidden emails....trump's a rapist etc. Let's call the whole thing off and keep Obama til we can figure this  clusterffk out!!!
18 | Joey Seay | 42 | 1552140754805949_1552166378136720 | So wait wait wait..... Now according to democrats Trump,The Russians,Wikileakes, the director and agents of the FBI, and federal judges are trying to influence the election? But Donald Trump was crazy when he said the elections were rigged.....Hummmmmmm...
19 | Steve Russo | 20 | 1552140754805949_550003705193771 | Awesome I was worried they wouldn't get the search warrant. Now here go the democratic operatives attacking the same man they were praising in July. He received the information Thursday and reported to congress the very next day. Hillary only has Hillary to blame for this. The DNC knew all about this and still chose to hand her the nomination. They only have themselves to blame!!!
20 | Gary Double | 31 | 1552140754805949_1552155514804473 | Does anyone find it odd that the "Hatch Act" was never brought up when the FBI seemed to be siding with the Dems and their candidate, but now it's a big deal when things aren't going their way!
21 | Steven Snodgrass | 29 | 1552140754805949_550012158526259 | I'm With HILLARY more than ever now‚ÄºÔ∏è. Hillary is nobody‚Äôs idea of perfect. Fine. But in my view if a man with her qualifications were running in the Democratic primary, Bernie would have been done before he even started. And if a man with her qualifications had been running for the Republicans, they‚Äôd be anointing him the next Reagan while trying to sneak his face onto Mount Rushmore.
22 | Janice Marie Kenney | 12 | 1552140754805949_1552145901472101 | Weiner should have told his weiner "down boy."Never should he have texted any female never mind a 15 year old. Men cannot think. They can only think with their ?That is the only brain they have üòÇ
23 | Henry Rios | 20 | 1552140754805949_1809044922644378 | There's no doubt that Trump and Republicans have felt the pressure of losing the race to the presidency. There's also no doubt that the GOP pressured Comey into making a statement without a pinch of evidence in order to cast doubt to undecided voters. Too many young voters out there that don't know how Al Gore was ripped off from winning the presidency; and here we go again! It doesn't matter that the FBI has no concrete proof of any wrongdoing? I am sickened by how the GOP will play filthy dirty politics to win at any cost. Democrats need to grow a pair and play dirty too!!! If Trump can cast accusations without proof then let's do the same. Since he is unwilling to show his taxes, then that must mean he is a crook. Since there are so many women claiming sexual assault and misconduct, then he must be a sexual predator. His racist, sexist, divisive comments, and the fact that he does not offer substantial or proven policies--that he'll offer real plans AFTER he becomes president is absolutely OUTRAGEOUS! The email scandal is the only thing the GOP and Trump have left. Let's see...emails vs. sexual assault and misconduct, criminal business deals, and the fact that he has absolutely NO EXPERIENCE to ensure that he can do the job as president. Trump supporters will say that it doesn't matter that he doesn't have the knowledge and experience, as he will hire people to run the country for him. OH HELL NO! Hillary supporters must stand their ground and vote for Hillary 2016! Please get out there and VOTE!
24 | Kay Johnson | 20 | 1552140754805949_1552152631471428 | If these emails have no value to the Clinton server, Comey is going to go down. Seems like they should have done all of this prior to contacting Congress Republicans.
25 | Joe Young | 8 | 1552140754805949_1809034595978744 | Two faced.  FBI was great when they recommended no charges. Oh and that had no influence on the election. But now when it goes against what you want it violates the hatch law. Those in congress should be fired or locked up.

Tested by a yet another scandal just over a week from Election Day, Hillary Clinton's campaign is mustering its allies to go on the offensive against FBI Director James Comey.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Philip E. McDaniel | 383 | 1552080614811963_1552082368145121 | If Comey, or his staff, did review the email without a warrant, he/they invalidate all findings. If he/they didn't review them, then he couldn't know enough to send the letter. Either way, Comey made a major mistake.
2 | John Norwicz | 197 | 1552080614811963_1552082714811753 | There's a old saying: you better have better lawyers than me! RE: Clinton vs FBI. Did the FBI violate the 4th Amendment by expanding Weiner probe to Clinton's emails?Let me add, The Justice Department and Loretta Lynch need to announce a formal investigation into Comey's action focusing on a potential violation of the Hatch Act (google it). Influencing the outcome of a federal election is not only an ethical violation, it is a violation of federal law.
3 | Maja Prelog | 135 | 1552080614811963_1552086898144668 | Why is this happening now, 10 days before election? Because she didn't give FBI all the e-mails when she was supposed to. And why didn't she give them all the e-mails? I guess what was in the e-mails is far worse than the trouble she is having now. Losing the election will be just the begining of her trouble.
4 | Leo Decaj | 219 | 1552080614811963_1552081634811861 | Hillary has been working very hard in last 30 years entire life to get power and make money. She has compromised security and sold herself for cash to the highest donors. Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait Iran .etc...How can I vote for someone who doesn't know how to separate personal emails from work mails? Who knows the law and breaks the law, thinking everyone would just let her walk free. When challenged by people, shock, how dare we ask questions, we are so stupid, we don't know how busy she works. Come on, really?
5 | Shane Hurley | 176 | 1552080614811963_1552083941478297 | Lmao, hillary is so desperate to avoid being held accountable she is actually resorting to attacking the fbi! The total pos never ceases to amaze how low and pathetic a level she can reach. It's going to be amazing after obama can no longer protect her also!
6 | Kayla Marie | 88 | 1552080614811963_1552087638144594 | If she wasn't so corrupt and always doing something that isn't legal or ethical she wouldn't have all the issues with scandals that she has. She can blame anyone she wants to but these things are coming out because of her actions

8 | Frank Joseph Buypal | 93 | 1552080614811963_1552086971477994 | So the person that wants to be president of the USA is trying interfere with an FBI investigation? Criminal investigations aren't meant to be swayed by public opinions.....Clinton has just disqualified herself from office
9 | Charlotte Hodge | 62 | 1552080614811963_1552084004811624 | Go Hillary! We got your back! Let go on your research about Trump! Highlight his Trump U fraud and Rape case trials! This man is irresponsible and unfit!
10 | Jim Williams | 20 | 1552080614811963_1552108181475873 | Unless the new emails reveal that Clinton cheated on three spouses, molested a dozen men, ripped off hundreds of workers and contractors and investors, defrauded hundreds of students, mocked a handicapped reporter, lost a billion on a casino in 1995 when the economy was booming, is going to court for fraud and raping a 13 year old boy, and used the money from her foundation to line her own pockets and bribe two attorneys general, I'm sticking with Hillary.
11 | Marcia Bunofsky Hixon | 23 | 1552080614811963_1552100191476672 | All this did for me was get my mail in ballot done this weekend. I am contemplating driving our ballots to the clerks office. Two votes for Hillary from this household.

Our system is so screwed up and I literally can't believe the people that still support Hillary. NBC.... Is bought and paid for. Its a very sad time for the united states.
13 | Jamie Slone | 19 | 1552080614811963_1552110344808990 | You people that are supporting Hillary hoping for a technicality to get her off are what's wrong with the US. The fact she is even allowed to run shows the corruption in the US. Hillary for prison 2016!
14 | Carol Andersen | 10 | 1552080614811963_1552146618138696 | Enough of this famous e-mails that is costing tax payers money, while Trump avoided and still proudly avoids paying federal taxes.Federal taxes that among many other things, supports all branches of our military.  Now, he wants to be commander in chief of that same military he never economically supported?   As a wife and mother of veterans I find that the most disgusting thing!
15 | Larry Papka | 13 | 1552080614811963_1552110821475609 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.
16 | Dave Archambault | 12 | 1552080614811963_1552134784806546 | He'd better watch his back, eh folks? You're all laughable... two months ago, he was your hero... while the rest of the country sat in complete and utter amazement of the words that he spewed. Now... with what will be additional evidence, evidence that now has the ability to separate him from the grasp of the DOJ, the DNC, the White House and the Clinton Crime Family to expose and convict Killary... as should have been done from the beginning.
17 | Loretta Cole | 10 | 1552080614811963_1552092608144097 | You all have no clue what so ever what is in these emails and for Trump to keep claiming that its bigger than Watergate tells you 1 of 2 things. He's either lying or he knows what it is. Hmmmm, how could it be the latter?
18 | Carla Brookman | 23 | 1552080614811963_1552083938144964 | WATERGATE JOURNALIST: FBI Wouldn‚Äôt Reopen Hillary Investigation Unless It Was ‚ÄúA Real Bombshell‚Äù (Bernstein: FBI Would Not Reopen Case Unless New Evidence Was ‚ÄúA Real Bombshell‚ÄùCARL BERNSTEIN: Well, there‚Äôs no question that the e-mails have always been the greatest threat to her candidacy for president, that her conduct in regard to the e-mails is really indefensible and if there was going to be more information that came out, it was the one thing, as I said on the air last night, actually that could really perhaps affect this election.We don‚Äôt know what this means yet except that it‚Äôs a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that‚Äôs where we are‚Ä¶Is it a certainty that we won‚Äôt learn before the election? I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs a certainty we won‚Äôt learn before the election.IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT BERNSTEIN  IS A HILLARY SUPPORTER BUT EVEN HE KNOWS THIS IS HUGE. HE CALLED INTO CNN TO OFFER HIS ANALYSIS ‚ùóÔ∏èThese are Carl Bernstein's opinions and not mine.
19 | Dawn Boone | 5 | 1552080614811963_1552126068140751 | That is sad! They are the FBI and have every right to investigate a crime! If she does this, she is just digging her own grave! She should have gave this seat to Bernie!!! Why would she go to war with him. Did he not also handle Whitewater???? I am confused! I thought he was her friend all along.
20 | Kaydee Rain | 6 | 1552080614811963_1552121134807911 | Comey/republicans are trying to make nothing seem like something. Comey is clearly working with gop in an effort to smear Clinton or clintons ppl would have been informed about an investigation instead of a rushed secret letter to gop. He does need to lose his job and this makes the previous lengthy investigation seem like collusion with republicans
21 | Deanna Burkart | 3 | 1552080614811963_724659524353576 | Really...war with Comey??! Wow, how can we expect the next 4 years to go if she is declaring war on Comey? Must have been something deeply concerning for him to take it this far, don't you think? I'm sure he knew what a controversy this would cause.
22 | Shane Westergard | 6 | 1552080614811963_1552143681472323 | Shouldn't her campaign "mustering its allies to go on the offensive against FBI Director James Comey" be a major concern in itself? I don't believe he is running for office Should that not be a preliminary to obstructing justice? How would attacking Comey prove her innocence?
23 | Tim Bruner | 6 | 1552080614811963_724662427686619 | Just to put this into perspective:A person that is running for the highest office in the land is "going to war" with the head of the FBI over the possibility that charges may be leveled against her for criminal wrongdoing. Let that sink in.
24 | Steve Naef | 5 | 1552080614811963_1809584932591128 | Hillary is the sole reason for the Damage done to the Republic Hillary made the choice to corrupt the Government position all by herself she was warned early in the SOS position about conflicts and even signed a letter confirming that fact and she did it anyway and for MONEY..... "Secretary Clinton had an extraordinary email arrangement with herself. She is the author of her own destiny‚Ä¶ So I understand she's upset, and I understand she doesn't like the timing, but she need look no further than herself.
25 | Etay Sales | 5 | 1552080614811963_1552124191474272 | STAY STRONG !! Hillary Clinton. NO TIME TO SLOW DOWN!!! Comey should have consequences of his action releasing an incomplete email report. It is obvious, someone is trying to hurt your campaign. Is there any investigation who are behind or part of this scheme?

Hillary Clinton's campaign chief railed against the revelations from Jim Comey, and challenged the FBI director to look into who's been hacking his email.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mike Martinez | 330 | 1551940314825993_1551941684825856 | She has been lying to the American public about big & small issues since the 90's, and still blatantly lies about everything under the sun. She hasn't learned much!#LandedUnderSniperFire
2 | Lisa Anne | 267 | 1551940314825993_1551942621492429 | Oh please! Hillary said, "explain everything right away, put it all out on the table.‚Äù Had she taken her own advice she wouldn't be in the hot seat. I hope she gets BURNED!
3 | Michael Anthony | 89 | 1551940314825993_1551944048158953 | Hmmm...30 years in politics and she still didn't know how to handle e-mails properly??? Yep, I guess she has learned from all that experience, huh? Hillary supporters who feel that she is the most "qualified", why don't you give me a list of her prominent accomplishments over the last three decades. Having simply a "long" r√©sum√© means nothing. Anyone that old in age has a long r√©sum√©.
4 | Carolyn Carlisle | 81 | 1551940314825993_1551943011492390 | Hillary Clinton had held a very high title where there is NO room for this kind of mistakes. REALLY now Hillary Clinton wants to hold the highest title of our Nation, POTUS well that not going to happen
5 | Marcus Ramdhanie | 86 | 1551940314825993_1551940804825944 | The people of the United States are about to learn from mistakes when Hillary Clinton goes to prison where she belongs
6 | Ryan Mathis | 34 | 1551940314825993_1551947761491915 | Yea, Hillary learned from her criminal actions therefore shouldn't face any consequences and be allowed to hold the highest office in the land. Sure! Tell that to millions facing time for their poor decisions and lack of good judgement too. Why is Hillary above the law?
7 | Billy D'Antoni | 28 | 1551940314825993_1551954678157890 | I love how democrats try to switch everything around and blame someone else every time they are caught red handed. It's a sad day when the chief of a campaign needs to make such a weak and sorry excuse for his corrupt boss and even more sad is inspite of the evidence there are brain dead sheep who will still vote for this criminal kingpin. Even though the person who risked their life to inform us of Hillarys corruption is not the problem and would not have been needed if Hillary wasn't so corrupt to begin with.
8 | Stephen Rosenberg | 27 | 1551940314825993_1551949391491752 | I love Hillary even more now!! It is  proven she is a target! Years and years of republicans continued attacks, investigations and inquiries has turned up nothing, no charges no evidence! She is obviously the best choice for president with the highest credentials and experience! Her opponent is a misogynistic sexual predator with zero morals!! Emails or no emails #imwithher  #donewithemails
9 | Pete Leclair | 10 | 1551940314825993_1551954268157931 | Remembered when she was laughing at the death of Kadafi as it went down. Who is not laughing now. You would think Podestas who knows his future collaboration with Clinton would come under intense scrutiny. Switching to a different email account obviously did not come to his thoughts feeling the arrogance of self loathing and feeling impenetrable obviously is coming back to bite him hard.
10 | Karl Edward | 13 | 1551940314825993_1551979681488723 | She's never learned anything.  She has been a pathological liar her entire life and the Clintons have been embroiled in scandals since their young adulthood.  She is a criminal shrew who is about to get her just due..prison!!
11 | Jim Williams | 7 | 1551940314825993_1551978414822183 | The Bundy traitors are set free while the Dakota Pipeline protesters are attacked with military and police Nazis and the media thinks Hillary's e-mails are a bigger deal than Russia and the FBI trying to help Trump decide our Presidential election.
12 | Bruce Southworth | 6 | 1551940314825993_1552103961476295 | An Obama appointee James Comey is reopening the investigation of criminal misconduct oh Obama's pick for president, and you DNC low brows think it is a move to politicize the FBI Y'all has some issue that I cannot help you with.
13 | Bob Adams | 11 | 1551940314825993_1551951881491503 | As long as NBC and the rest of the main stream continue to be subjective propaganda instead of objective news the Democrats will be slow to change their negative behavior. The media should hold very body accountable.

Mike Pence on Sunday questioned why Huma Abedin, a senior aide to Hillary Clinton, has yet to personally release the contents of emails.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Madalyn Rubin McGovern | 1345 | 1551884561498235_1551885948164763 | Why isn't he asking why Donald Trump won't release his taxes? There's plenty of dirt there or he would release them. This is the biggest scam of this election.
2 | Joey Armas | 841 | 1551884561498235_1551888138164544 | I've questioned why Mike Pence has not been called out for being the racist and homophobic bigot that he is. He is a disgraceful man and it speaks volumes about Trump that he would select a VP who would force women to have a funeral when they miscarry. His own state is tired of his antics...why does he think that America would want  a disgraceful leader like this.
3 | Tina Favela | 538 | 1551884561498235_1551888954831129 | Everybody in the US: please release all your emails to the FBI. The obsession with email is mind bogglingü§î
4 | Rhonda Elam Benedict | 353 | 1551884561498235_1551888921497799 | She doesn't have these emails. They are on a computer that has been seized by FBI in Weiner investigation. She already turned over all the emails she had. That's why Comey said they could be duplicates of what they already have seen. Hillary wants them released but FBI has to get a subpoena to look at them first. Hillary and Huma want them released to public because they do not fear what's in them.
5 | Linda DeFurio | 287 | 1551884561498235_1551891018164256 | Donald Trump, the King of Bankruptcy, professional conman, draft dodger, tax cheat and sexual predator is a psychotic self-absorbed narcissist. His style of hate-mongering politics makes America look like a third world country. The fact that he is even being considered for president is shameful.Mike Pence worse than trump.
6 | Jamie Gulin | 162 | 1551884561498235_1551889431497748 | What about trumps taxes? This douche says research on tobacco dangers are a liberal conspiracy. Sorry #IN you're getting him back #clintonkaine2016
7 | Bruce Oleson | 150 | 1551884561498235_1551890941497597 | First off this bigot has no right to demand anything. Second when is this ignorant bigots boss going to release his tax returns. Funny how republitards only know how to demand others to bend to their will but when the same is asked of them they have the attitude that they don't answer to anyone. HYPOCRITES !
8 | Rod Jones | 77 | 1551884561498235_1551910194829005 | Perhaps all candidates should release their emails and those that work for them starting with mr pence, their tax returns, their daily schedule with who they talk with, who they see. Republicans are so offensively double standard, buried in a narrow righteousness. You don't have to like democratic politics to find republicans despicable desperate people for power.
9 | Jill Halvax | 70 | 1551884561498235_1551890211497670 | Get off the e-mails. They will never charge her with anything. Don't we all know that by now. I don't care for her but I am sick of all the bs. Pence I thought you were different.
10 | Bobby Phillips | 38 | 1551884561498235_1551904684829556 | huma abedin is not running for president nor is she the target of any investigation...perhaps he should concentrate on having his idiot running mates tax returns released...those would prove much more informative and relative to the election...
11 | Shelley Barnard | 35 | 1551884561498235_1551918891494802 | Has he offered up his emails?  Has he called upon his running mate to release his taxes?  As long as those are shrouded in secrecy, I think the Trump campaign needs to be REALLY careful about transparency accusations
12 | Sean Salazar | 55 | 1551884561498235_1551884844831540 | So many people talking about the Clinton FBI investigation "why is the FBI not providing evidence right away?" and I see Hillary demanding to see the evidence immediately. Hillary is an attorney, she knows this just rhetoric, she is using reverse psychology that you would use on a five-year-old purely out of desperation. In Step 4 of the criminal process there is something called "discovery" that is when the defendant will receive all the details and all the information and all the evidence pertaining to the charges, we will all find this out soon that is if she doesn't hammer out a plea deal. The FBI are closers. They don't lose cases, when they bring charges you can be sure its airtight.
13 | Michael Sidky Ph D | 27 | 1551884561498235_1551906328162725 | What a stupid question from Pence. The FBI hasn't even read the Emails or even know what is in them to begin with, which makes the timing of Comey's Electioneering Letter dubious and leads to the conclusion that it was to influence the race in favor of Trump.  And even so, why should she release anything to these fools? The world is still waiting for the tax returns which Trump refuses to release. And why doesn't Trump at least release last year's taxes? His taxes for last year are not being audited!
14 | Bette Trybus | 28 | 1551884561498235_1551898178163540 | Donald Trump will NEVER show his taxes, wonder why? He has scammed enough, he has not paid taxes in 18 years and probably a lot more, I bet that would change some minds, reading his cheat sheets
15 | Maria Boley Hieken | 24 | 1551884561498235_1551905028162855 | Huma can release her records when EVERY staff employee of Trumps campaign releases their records too...releasing records must go BOTH ways...I bet Pence has a LOT hiding in his closet! To be THAT homophobic, THAT racist, THAT judgemental has proven to be their downfall in the past...Im sure you will find a few perverted fetishes, calls to porn sights...SOMETHING sinister is lurking in his closet, that's for sure!
16 | Barbara A Yelvington | 25 | 1551884561498235_1551910924828932 | Oh Pence,, really, being Trumps running mate shows all we need to know about you. What once was your political career is now your trademark of Ignorance. Good Luck in your future, maybe Donald will give you a job after this is over.
17 | Brenda Lee Sharp | 26 | 1551884561498235_1551897798163578 | Then all of us Americans want your backround and we want trumps tax records released ASAP!!!! Im sure there is records of him getting money from Russia and not paying taxes either.
18 | Judy Scott | 24 | 1551884561498235_1551899468163411 | Pence is an Idiot like his candidate! Even FBI said they didn't have a search warrant to obtain the emails. Even former Bush Ethics lawyer, Painter, has filed a complaint against Comey.
19 | Pierce Watson Snr | 18 | 1551884561498235_1551911788162179 | Why aren't Republicans releasing all their e-mails. There needs to be an investigation into Republicans and their affiliations with white supremacists groups.
20 | Peggy Scott | 14 | 1551884561498235_1551927944827230 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks....
21 | Don Reed | 20 | 1551884561498235_1551926458160712 | More proof that the republicans are continuing an fruitless witch hunt against Hillary. This shows they will do ANYTHING to divert attention from the poor excuse of a. Candidate "Trump".
22 | Donnita Dagg | 16 | 1551884561498235_1551892324830792 | Oh for heaven sake! How far out are we going to throw this net. I know someone named Hillary. Should I release my emails too?
23 | Moses Fluker | 9 | 1551884561498235_1392251480804650 | This part of the Republican party is ridiculous-- this the part I have a problem with his conversation-- he act like the American people can't walk and chew gum at the same time yes we want to see them taxes-- why are y'all people's intentions dividing this country
24 | Andi Law | 15 | 1551884561498235_1551909891495702 | Are we REALLY sure this is a road we want to go down? I'm betting everyone, EVERYONE, would be mortified if their personal emails were released, in and out of context. This is a bad bad idea. Bad.
25 | Jon Kevin Reid | 7 | 1551884561498235_1392301287466336 | Huma Abedin went out of her way to give the FBI everything they needed. Above and beyond even. I mean, it's not inconceivable that an employee and her boss would have email communications, right?Prediction. This lastest "bombshell" is nothing and it's political gamesmanship to influence voters. A.k.a - rigging. It will disappear after Nov 8 like ebola after the last election.

The two former deputy attorney generals claim the FBI chief is putting a "damaging our democracy" with his announcement of newly discovered emails in the Clinton private server case.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jimmy D Morgan | 560 | 1551816748171683_1551819158171442 | It just funny that 3 months ago he was called an honorable republican that did his job... now the same people are saying he's evil.
2 | Mariah Monet | 393 | 1551816748171683_1551817651504926 | This is a dirty political move , he's doing this for politics not because of his job title. The Republicans were so upset he didn't charge her this is his way of trying to save his dying party. Democrats are taking back control in November,  there's no saving the Republican party. This was a very dirty manipulative tactic it's the motive that's the problem .
3 | John Wagner | 290 | 1551816748171683_1551821441504547 | Can we all acknowledge this is all because of Hillary for her lies and cover ups? If she would have told the truth from the beginning and cooperate she wouldn't be in this situation. No one else's fault but hers!!!
4 | Joseph Crouse | 160 | 1551816748171683_1551826354837389 | he was damaging democracy when he didnt hold clinton accountable to the same standards that would have put anybody ELSE with a security clearance behind bars for the rest of their life.
5 | Samuel Zuniga | 80 | 1551816748171683_1551822108171147 | Conservative say "i don't care what trump did 30 years ago about rape.""Bring up the past about hillary all the time."Yall do realize that republicans have done the same thing she has. Im not saying she aint guilty because she is but if your gonna go after her, go after the rape as well.
6 | Mustafe M Osman | 40 | 1551816748171683_1551824144837610 | Question for all Trump defenders:Why are Trump's accusers lying but Bill Clinton's are telling the truth?Monica Lewinsky was an "affair." There was no assault. She was the only one with any evidence and it was only evidence of an affair. All the others were just claims. Exactly the same as Trump. Some decades later, waited until he was president, and waited until other women made claims first. It's EXACTLY the same. Bill Clinton denied all charges other than having an affair. We all know Trump has had affairs also. Trump has been accused of raping a 13 year old. He goes to court in December. There are 4 witnesses listed and one is a convicted pedophile and when previously asked about Trump under oath he plead the 5th. Trump has denied all assault charges. Clinton denied all assault charges. Trump and Clinton have both admitted to having affairs. Trump left his first two wives for his mistresses. We know they have both had affairs. So, again, why is Clinton lying but Trump is telling the truth?AND bonus question: Why is Hillary "bad" for criticizing the women (trusting her husband was telling her the truth) but it's okay for Trump to call his accusers horrible unattractive liars? Conclusions: I am not voting this election.
7 | Brenda Reichert | 25 | 1551816748171683_1551845718168786 | He has no right to hold the American citizens hostage with some pathetic cat and mouse game!!! He should be terminated effective immediately and kiss that sweet retirement and benefits good bye!!!!
8 | Cristina Ibanez Pando | 11 | 1551816748171683_734476963374784 | Obviously Comey's ulterior motive was to damage HRC and the results of the presidential election. He should be FIRED for defying the DoJ's protocol. He's as misogynistic as his sex predator GOP presidential candidate, for blatantly disrespecting with his actions the current FEMALE Attorney General, Loretta Lynch.
9 | Bg Caudill | 52 | 1551816748171683_1551821328171225 | A couple of months ago Clinton knew he saved her life. Now a turn what a drama this is! America do we want to stay in this twilight zone for 8 more years?
10 | Tasha Whitaker | 53 | 1551816748171683_1551823128171045 | I don't think he's damaging democracy. He's finally came to his senses and decided to help restore our constitutional republic that has been so corrupted people think it's a democracy.
11 | Joseph J Martin | 69 | 1551816748171683_1551817128171645 | Here's a question for you:Why is Hillary Clinton still running for President, when legally she is disqualified? Is she really above the law?  This law clearly outlines the penalty for actions EXACTLY like what Mrs. Clinton did with the emails - she should lose her current office and be disqualified from holding ANY other U.S. political office, especially the office of President!  That is the law, as shown here. If she's elected, it really will be an illegal election. " U.S. Code ‚Ä∫ Title 18 ‚Ä∫ Part I ‚Ä∫ Chapter 101 ‚Ä∫ ¬ß 207118 U.S. Code ¬ß 2071 - Concealment, removal, or mutilation generallyCurrent through Pub. L. 114-38.

12 | Michael Sicola | 14 | 1551816748171683_734393793383101 | So when a former president meets the atty general on a plane the weekend of hillary testifying before the FBI and comey moving not to indict even though her acts of "extremely carelessness" are grounds to indict they didn't ruin democracy then? You dems should be scared to death that whatever the FBI found on wieners computer was significant enough to reopen an investigation that was "taken care of." We may see her arrested at a rally or taken from her home I cuffs. Either way her campaign is pretty much over. The only thing the DNC and hillary have left is voter fraud and bird dogging.
13 | Pat Hatcher- Houser | 13 | 1551816748171683_1551846524835372 | This Sounds fishy to me that this comes out just a couple of weeks before the election. Of course it's said its not even Hillarys server but her aides. Just didn't see fit to go into details naturally. I say take away his power and after the election fire his a**. But I don't think it makes any difference now, because the Democrats know, or anybody with half a brain knows, it's just a last ditch attempt to sabotage the election. Nice try but it won't work !!!
14 | Dave Windsor | 17 | 1551816748171683_1551837304836294 | Comey should be terminated immediately. He has damaged the impartiality of the FBI, and used his position to interfere in a Presidential election.
15 | Barbara MacNeill Sukeforth Lundin | 7 | 1551816748171683_1551852491501442 | They are ALL damaging democracy... Republicans in  congress should be ousted asap.. some this year, some in two years, but GONE! IF they can find republicans with a brain, bring em on, but the regressive idiots there now must be unseated so that sanity rules!
16 | Sheila Paige | 3 | 1551816748171683_734539026701911 | PLEASE!!!! Don't let the opinions/directions of others? polls, political analysts and outcome  predictions determine your participation in the voting process. Register‚Ä¶ Vote‚Ä¶ Exercise your right to be heard!
17 | Tori D'Ambrosio | 11 | 1551816748171683_1551842148169143 | He needs to be fired, he knew what he was doing, and blatantly went behind everybody's back and did what he was told not to do, he's just another fukstick in the the basket full of deplorable's !!!
18 | Louise Pucillo Hammerl | 7 | 1551816748171683_1551850678168290 | I think it's kind of funny that he wasn't more specific in his letter...I also think he violated the 60 day rule...perhaps he is trying to keep his base happy but there is a 60 day rule that he violated.  but of course the republicans are stretching it so it becomes a clinton issue...forget the cheating that DT did to working people; forget the allegations of rape of a 13 year old with 2 eye witnesses to be hear on Dec 16..forget the transparency of tax returns...forget..forget...forget...and then attack, attack, attack....trumpsters are just plain stupid
19 | Antonio Orsini | 4 | 1551816748171683_734395630049584 | No absolutey not , Comey did the wrong thing alrightBUT by so doing he improved the chance for the democrats to win the election. Smart Americans will now turn to Clinton instead, to save usa from the fraudester trump.
20 | Jack Carrenard | 7 | 1551816748171683_734383540050793 | The right wing nut jobs have infiltrated the ranks of the Justice Department prosecutors. With all that is going on, why would the FBI fast track a sexting case. Unless the defendant is married to Clinton top aide. It was definitely a political hit job to save the Republicans. Comey alas is a partisan Republican.
21 | Allison Hagood | 19 | 1551816748171683_1551821158171242 | The emails weren't from Clinton, weren't sent to Clinton, weren't on her server, weren't on a device she owned, were on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner, and Comey didn't have a warrant for them, so he hasn't even seen them.He is deliberately interfering with the election.
22 | Anbritt Stengele | 7 | 1551816748171683_1551834164836608 | There's a protocol for a reason. The FBI director has created a circus. He needs to clear up his vague statements and fully present his points so the country can move forward.
23 | Linda Yaeger | 5 | 1551816748171683_1551851491501542 | No warrant to even review the content of the electronics so how did he even know that there was "pertinent" information or emails on the electronics? Unless he illegally accessed the electronics himself or had someone else do it, is he psychic or just a liar? Obviously he is in possession of illegally obtained information considering what he wrote to Congress so he had better fork it over and he probably destroyed the investigation into Weiner too...
24 | Michele Washam | 6 | 1551816748171683_1551855494834475 | Until 2 days ago, I had the utmost respect for the FBI... whether there is a smoking gun or not, what Comey did went against decades of protocol and tradition. I have lost all confidence in the worlds best investigative agency and all respect.
25 | Dave Silva | 4 | 1551816748171683_537179283148293 | The real problem I see here is the ongoing witch hunt, 30 years now which has cost the US $500 million. Give it up! It is pretty obvious nothing sticks. I remember the Reagan years and the two major investigations, Illegal guns to Nicaragua and the saving and loans scandal which caused black friday. Investigations did not stick to Reagan, hence the nickname teflon President. When it was all over the Democrats moved on, unlike the Republicans who are like a dog with a bone, worrying it to death. Bill Clinton out Republican'd the Republicans and since then have been after him and every Dem President, a party of obstruction and not ideas. Old saying, you cannot go back home.  June Cleaver days are over, so let's move forward.

Reporters covering a Donald J. Trump rally in Arizona Saturday were baited by a man who shouted an anti-Semitic chant and told them: "You're going down!"
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Rob Visconti | 2289 | 1551719588181399_1551720284847996 | Bigotry and hate runs deep with Trump and his DEPLORABLE SUPPORTERS. This man is Trump. #NeverTrump
2 | Festus Kasyoka Mbuva | 1706 | 1551719588181399_1551722264847798 | Going by some comments here, this guy is "planted" by Clinton... well if that's the case, she's planted 99% of Trump supporters coz that's pretty much the mantra
3 | James Fisher | 937 | 1551719588181399_1551726544847370 | Trump supporters are a sad and ugly picture.  They can pretend he's an outlier, but he's merely a reflection of the way they "think."
4 | Kevin Cochran | 595 | 1551719588181399_1551739424846082 | Hillary for president. Don't get confused betwen the difference of emails over a pervert , racist  bigot punk. She's been under investigation since 92 and the republican witch still have nothing. Comeys recent political stunt due too Trumps losing by a landslide will only help Clinton even more. Idiot put out a statement without backing it up with evidence only shows what this was really about. Get use to it folks Hillary is the next POTUS
5 | DawnMarie Mendy | 345 | 1551719588181399_1551727384847286 | Why is anyone surprised by this ? Frump is a racist bigot who has brought this on. He incites violence, hatred and racism, how could you expect anything less at one of his camps. Make America HATE Again should be his slogan. Oh wait let me guess, it's Hillarys fault ? #donthecon #gobackunderyourrock. YOUR FIRED ! How can anyone not see the sickness in this man? He is despicable.
6 | Chip McFarland | 337 | 1551719588181399_1551741901512501 | Good gosh November 8th can't come soon enough so Hillary can begin the transition to take the torch from President Obama and all these disgusting racists can crawl back into their rat holes.
7 | Alex Webb | 211 | 1551719588181399_1551726694847355 | Expect no less than the party of hate. Please trumpers explain to me how hate of Jews or other religions or races of non whites is great for America?
8 | Sonia Pelayo Serrano | 192 | 1551719588181399_1551724024847622 | Of course what can we expect !!!!! these supporters act like savages !!!! this is what he does he spews hate and his puppets do the same !!! I feel bad for the child that had to hear this crap !!!
9 | Cheryl Williams | 208 | 1551719588181399_1551725824847442 | I am a Trump supporter and I Do Not agree with what this guy did. Some people are just not mentally all there. Hillary has them on Her side also. And you can't tell me she doesn't.
10 | George Lawrence | 91 | 1551719588181399_1551727178180640 | Another example of NBC  and their obvious political bias. It begs the question why they would give this idiot the time of day and media coverage. Unless of course,  they are implying that Mr Trump and ALL  his supporter's are RACISTS! If anyone is a racist it's NBC for giving this idiot a media platform for his racism.
11 | Meghan Kathleen Jones | 54 | 1551719588181399_1133899416697742 | It's funny that the people that have the biggest issue with this guy are the ones that's are talking the most crap. I'm not racist. I'm not a bigot. I don't hate gays. I'm not a redneck. Why is it these people feel the need to insult me because I refuse to vote for a criminal? Come on people.
12 | Rick Friedman | 46 | 1551719588181399_1133872980033719 | NBC  must really think the average voter is an idiot if they think that this planted story about one "alleged" supporter Will do anything but show conclusively that they are in the tank for their goddess and master ....they completely ignored the other 20,000 people and focused on this idiot who probably was planted by Hillary you really think the American voters is this stupid don't you NBClinton?
13 | Aymara' Arthur | 47 | 1551719588181399_1646093542350141 | Based on the delightful undercover documentary video, we all know there is a good chance this guy was paid by DNC organizers to cause a scene. Thanks, media, for assuring his paycheck.
14 | Robert Duncan | 42 | 1551719588181399_1551743784845646 | All of a sudden the trump campaign doesn't support this kind of behavior? A few months ago trump was pointing out the media and saying how much he hates them. He was offering to pay the legal fees for those attacking protesters.
15 | Al Hicks | 45 | 1551719588181399_1133880720032945 | Of course, NBC would search the entire crowd(s) for this one nut, and then broadcast it over the world. Want to guess if they do the same hunt in Hillary crowds?Oops, I forgot! There ARE NO Hillary crowds!!! üòÅ
16 | Steve Electmann | 50 | 1551719588181399_1551744224845602 | NBC panicking like CNN! They desperately want voters to forget about Friday's news about Killary being under FBI investigation! Both news organizations are sad and pathetic just like this piece of garbage yelling Jew S A!
17 | Rona Neustadter Birnbaum | 32 | 1551719588181399_1551739758179382 | These are the low-lives being brought out by Trump's campaign! Though Trump himself is not antisemitic (as far as we know) he has enabled people to think they have the right to behave like this and has brought out all kinds of dangerous bigotry!
18 | Emmanu El | 32 | 1551719588181399_1551752268178131 | Wow, for one thing i support the Jews they suffer like black folks did and for you sir to spread your hate is deplorable , Donald Trump might condone your actions but America Rejects this bigotry.
19 | Scott Richardson | 18 | 1551719588181399_1551755961511095 | He yelled racist nonsense where as HRC called black men super predators. One is a supporter, most likely a plant, much like those uncovered by Project Veritas, the other one is the DNC nominee. Still having problems comprehending why some of us do not and cannot support HRC. Trump may be an idiot but he is not a career criminal or war monger. But that's none of my Benghazi.
20 | Angel Santiago | 24 | 1551719588181399_1551744358178922 | The Clinton campaign said worst things behind close doors. Thanks to wikileaks we know their view of minorities and religious people. Both sides are bigoted and xenophobic the problem is that the Clinton friendly news are reporting just one side. There is a leaked list of those "friendly" journalist to Clinton some of them even sent their articles to the DNC to be edited before publication.
21 | Josh Pendergrass | 22 | 1551719588181399_1551729658180392 | Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the campaign "strongly condemns this kind of rhetoric and behavior," in statement to Politico. "It is not acceptable at our rallies or elsewhere."The campaign then went on to say its only ok when Donald says it, but not his supporters he has molded.
22 | Rebecca Steve Robinson | 23 | 1551719588181399_1646104925682336 | I highly doubt Trump hates his own Jewish children.  Oh, and are you going to run the story on the Grand Dragon of the KKK endorsing Hillary and giving her a whopping $20,000???  If not, then stuff this story in the garbage.
23 | Belva Carlisle Bushman | 20 | 1551719588181399_1551755464844478 | I find it interesting that Clinton supporters are just as ugly in their attacks on conservatives as they accuse conservatives being towards them.  I have yet to meet a conservative who riots and loots and burns it's cities to make a point though.
24 | Caprice Cannes | 9 | 1551719588181399_1133967876690896 | Why are Trump cult followers so vile and racist. It's truly bringing out all the closet racists and evil scum in America. I've never seen anything like this in elections Trump breathes hatred. He's disgusting and anyone who supports him is disgusting.
25 | Maria Lambert | 21 | 1551719588181399_1551745981512093 | Yup, you gotta bring up that one guy (out of thousands) , because it helps to keep the spotlight off from Hillary's criminal activity.  NBC pouring kool-aid for the liberal masses....

It's an easy thing to look up. "Are we losing gravity, can it cause plate shifting or earthquakes?" I hope it stops for Italy and moves on... and yes... fraking is bad... and oil is super bad and polar ice caps melting because of overuse of oil is bad, it is all interconnected.. we are suffering the results of this now California is ... we are also having a polar shift... as normal... so it's all confusing... never actually recorded one... never had actual industrial age while a shift was happening... so... we are all vulnerable... these are interesting times and very scary... pray that we all make it out in one piece with peace in our hearts... this time.

When Linda Gottlieb hails a taxi cab in NYC and asks the driver to take her home, she has one word to describe how she feels: embarrassed.

Why? Because she has to tell the driver to take her to Trump Place.

1 | Todd Johnson | 883 | 1551649261521765_1551651131521578 | I don't blame her. I just found out my parents supporting Trump last night. Hoping today I find out I was adopted
2 | Ron Wallenburg | 553 | 1551649261521765_1551651984854826 | Nothing But Crap. Why are you publishing speculation about peoples feelings towards Trump when you could be publishing facts about Hillary's issues involving National Security?
3 | Dave DiBiase | 260 | 1551649261521765_1551659638187394 | NBC: why don't you report on the real news at hand instead of grasping at anything to discredit Trump?I'd like to see more on Weiner's laptop, Trump's rise in the polls, Hillary's reaction to be blindsided by the FBI, the rising premiums of Obamacare...The kind of reporting Cronkite, Woodward and Bernstein would have done.
4 | Kevin Forster Wilicki | 194 | 1551649261521765_1551659118187446 | Hey Linda... You can move.... So can everyone else who's embarrased. The proud Deplorables will fill the vacancies.... NBC - So liberal real news flys off your radar.
5 | Zaida Felix | 147 | 1551649261521765_1551661011520590 | My open letter to Trump supporters. I know it is long but please read and take a second to think about it. The future of this country depends on it. Feel free to share! So You Want Someone To ‚ÄòTell It Like It Is‚Äô? OK, Here You Go. 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin's puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals.3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade's cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said ‚Äú I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks.‚Äù Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person.4. You say you're patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution's limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin...etc5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton's history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can't ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional.8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem?9. I agree 100% if she's elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people‚Äôs money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home?11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin's little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right's anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country?12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said "Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,‚Äù and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillary's reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as "super-predators" in 1996? I don't agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don't care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.
6 | Matthew Leach | 90 | 1551649261521765_1551653534854671 | Move. There are millions upon millions of Americans who love and support Trump, make room they'll take your spot. Lmao.....Trump will be president.Hillbillery is a criminal and any who support her have no morals.

9 | Roberta Betz Gilmartin | 33 | 1551649261521765_1551703871516304 | The latest post on NBC NEWS about Linda Gottlieb and where she lives is the most ridiculous and biased thing I ever readShe knew who owned the building when she moved there!   DUHIt's not like she is living in a bombed out hovelIn Iraq !The political bias by NBC is so obvious that they shouldn't call themselves a news reporting network!
10 | Maria Russell | 15 | 1551649261521765_1551671244852900 | Pam read Scopes. There is no child rape charge. The only trial is the trump university case.Regarding the subcontractors....that was part of the bankruptcy. And the subcontractors were also able to charge it off on their taxes as a bad debt
11 | Jan McMullen | 27 | 1551649261521765_1551667164853308 | Well then Linda Gottlieb is a HYPOCRITE who had no problem moving in to begin with did she? She ought to embarrassed for this news story! Maybe she should have asked the Taxi driver to take her to her "safe space".

22 | Janet Butcher | 8 | 1551649261521765_1551693228184035 | Was she embarrassed before?    What is to be embarrassed about a man who loves his country enough to spend his own money to be ridiculed and maligned by the media and the progressive left.

1 | David Ames | 209 | 1551626588190699_1551631098190248 | Clinton is guaranteed 55 electorates in California, 29 in New York, and 20 in Illinois. If she can win Florida, there's no way she can lose!
2 | Mike Pareli | 160 | 1551626588190699_1551633148190043 | She's definitely going to be our next president, regardless how hard they trying to make her look bad.People already made up their mind so there's not much that can change..
3 | Gary Alexander | 122 | 1551626588190699_1551645294855495 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

9 | Ginni Junge | 27 | 1551626588190699_1551653591521332 | Here's a question for you:Why is Hillary Clinton still running for President, when legally she is disqualified? Is she really above the law?  This law clearly outlines the penalty for actions EXACTLY like what Mrs. Clinton did with the emails - she should lose her current office and be disqualified from holding ANY other U.S. political office, especially the office of President!  That is the law, as shown here. If she's elected, it really will be an illegal election.

10 | Dave Schmitt | 11 | 1551626588190699_1137762142985937 | What difference do these polls make since winning the Presidency means you need Electoral votes and not Popular Votes. Which means Hillary Clinton will be our next President.
11 | Bill Malcott | 17 | 1551626588190699_1551644741522217 | What kills me is Clinton playing the your daughter card, yet she wants to bring her husband back in the White House who already seduced someone's daughter in the White House.
12 | Mic Aro | 22 | 1551626588190699_1551636094856415 | I did not want to vote for Hillary but I definitely do not want Trump as POTUS because he makes Hillary look good compared to what he has been doing, screwing and cheating the American people for decades. He has had thousands of court cases against anyone he doesn't like and thousands of American people w/small businesses he wouldn't pay for services or goods putting many into bankruptcy. He is now up on fraud and racketeering charges for his fraudulent Trump University He doesn't give to charity, he said he raised $6 million for the vets yet he had to be shamed into giving them $1 million and the rest is in his bank. His father and grandfather were known for shady dealings w/shady characters and Trump is the worst. He got a huge drug king pin mobster off by getting his court case moved to his sister's court, she couldn't sit on the bench as this drug mobster was such a good friend of the Trumps but she did have a talk w/the judge that was appointed and instead of getting 20yrs, what he was supposed to get, he got a few months, When he got out he was broke, Trump put him in a million dollar apartment in Trump Towers. This all could have forfeited his gambling license. Trump's best friends are all con artists, cheats, criminals, mobsters along w/the KKK and White Supremacist groups, and the American Nazi group and Nazi Youth group! His mentor and second father was Roy Cohn. Look him up, he was the lawyer for the mobsters, an ugly horrendous person who was horrible to gays but when he died of aids it was found he was gay. When Trump was little he would throw rocks at babies and at 12 yrs his father sent him to military school because he was unmanageable. There is so so much more sick things Trump does that are beyond belief. So far Hillary hasn't been charged w/anything where Trump has been charged w/well over 4000 counts of fraud and racketeering where he settled or dragged it out in court until the person he ripped off ran out of court cost money. He has put numerous small businesses, some in families for generations, out of business because Trump wouldn't pay his bills. There is dirt on every cent Trump has, he is a con artist and that is why his ignorant supporters love him, he says what he knows that they want to hear and even reverses it in the same sentence. No one reads the Bible more than he does but can't give us one quote from it, he just wanted to get the religious right w/him. He will lie about what he says, he is a joke but it isn't funny, he knows nothing about what a president needs to know, he hasn't a clue. So far I have only heard that he will lower taxes, but especially for the rich, that old trickle down thing that has put us where we are but it would save him millions. The only thing he will do is anything that he profits from, he could care less for the people, after all, he wouldn't even pay what he owed them. At the least Hillary has worked for children, the handicapped and women for decades and has done some great things. So I don't care if she has done somethings wrong because it will never be even close to what Trump has done and what he is. I will vote for Hillary as a vote against Trump. I feel much safer w/her than w/Trump who will throw us right back into another huge depression and he will increase our debt by billions and billions. Obama has turned Bush's disaster around just to let this Bozo put us in the worst financial disaster yet, not to mention his nuclear war ideas, breaking up NATO and pretty much making every other country hate us. Hate, bigotry, putting people down, loving to take down anyone that doesn't love him and he has ruined a lot of lives because of his unreasonable temper, I don't want my grandkids growing up in Trumps kind of country. We don't need a tyrant, dictating Nazi lover as our POTUS. Suddenly he has done a total flip on his policies because his ratings were falling and he got new advisors so now he has some of the same policies that Hillary has had all along. It's a joke! He would do or say anything to win but if he does he will do what he wants and it will benefit him not us. Every time I hear him say Crooked Hillary, I laugh, he is King of Crooked! He is a poor excuse for a human being but now that his advisors have turned his attitude around and make him stick to the teleprompter, all to make him look like a sane and nice guy, I don't buy it, we have all seen his true hateful, bigoted, get even, lying, crooked side which is the real Trump and a lot more horrid beyond belief things. He is dangerous to us and our country. So, yes, I am voting for Hillary, compared to Trump she is a much safer bet! Hope we have better options in 4 years!
13 | Mark Singh | 14 | 1551626588190699_1551632034856821 | NC is a must win for Trump. He would need to run the table on all battleground states; FL, OH, NC, NV, NH, CO plus flip a blue state to win and of course all red and red leading states.
14 | Ted Carey | 7 | 1551626588190699_1551655744854450 | When you poll more Dummycrats of course it's going to show Killery in the lead. Same thing occurred in 1980 showing Carter with a big lead over Reagan and we all know what happened.
15 | Dan DeCost | 8 | 1551626588190699_1551647288188629 | Love how the polls are showing such low numbers for Johnson. The stats will only reflect the results based on how the data is collected. If you don't ask questions about Johnson obviously the numbers will be low. So your polls go out and influence people's decision.
16 | Ric Eller | 2 | 1551626588190699_1551796704840354 | If Hillary had a hand in the death of someone close to you, would still vote for her? Yes, you would, because you don't care. Now think think how those families with dead in Benghazi feel, when they believe she has responsibility in the loss of loved ones. She says "what does it matter now?" Well it matters to them now, I'll vote with them, anybody but Hillary!
17 | L Aguirre Monica | 3 | 1551626588190699_1809962662622878 | So surprised to see Cuban Republicans in Florida favor Trump. He represents everything they left behind in Cuba.  His rhetoric is very similar to that of its dictator.  People forget easily.
18 | Gerald Gray | 10 | 1551626588190699_1551636581523033 | Here is the real central issue.The problem is that we have a government that is forcing us to accept things that are contrary to our convictions. That is a government everyone should fear. You might think it is good for this or that now, but it becomes the slippery slope that only leads to complete government control of EVERYONE'S life.Hillary is the center piece of this corrupt government. D.Trump is the one who wants to stop it. You choose your fate with this election.
19 | Dan Lawler | 13 | 1551626588190699_1551652701521421 | Just remarkable how stupid people can be to even consider someone under investigation twice by the FBI for anything! just shows you the dumbing down of America.
20 | Yamiley Poitras David | 3 | 1551626588190699_1551673004852724 | Vote Trump and get Putin, then America willBecome AmeRussia.When you vote ask yourself why Putin is helping Trump his puppet that much,He envies us, he wants to get control over our great country.So don't Boo, Vote!!?The FBI director is a Republican who wants to help Trump to keep his job.Don't let them sell out America to Putin.
21 | Zaida Felix | 7 | 1551626588190699_1551657318187626 | My open letter to Trump supporters. I know it is long but please read and take a second to think about it. The future of this country depends on it. Feel free to share! So You Want Someone To ‚ÄòTell It Like It Is‚Äô? OK, Here You Go. 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin's puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals.3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade's cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said ‚Äú I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks.‚Äù Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person.4. You say you're patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution's limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin...etc5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton's history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can't ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional.8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem?9. I agree 100% if she's elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people‚Äôs money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home?11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin's little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right's anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country?12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said "Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,‚Äù and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillary's reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as "super-predators" in 1996? I don't agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don't care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.
22 | Brian Ochs | 0 | 1551626588190699_1809961579289653 | Being investigated by the FBI, being responsible for heroes being killed , have role models like jay-z, Miley Cyrus and Michael Moore on your side and stillWin the American vote you must be doing something right. Not sure what that is but the media thinks so.
23 | Chris McLeod | 6 | 1551626588190699_1551650824854942 | And the real story is that Clinton can lose NC, FL, OH and in order for Trump to win, he would have to carry all of those AND he has to flip a blue state where she's much further ahead such as PA or VA. (But that doesn't make good headlines. The media loves to push a horse race)
24 | Sheila Paige | 6 | 1551626588190699_1551644168188941 | PLEASE!!!! Don't let the opinions/directions of others? polls, political analysts and outcome  predictions determine your participation in the voting process. Register‚Ä¶ Vote‚Ä¶ Exercise your right to be heard!
25 | Kari Bittner | 0 | 1551626588190699_1551762284843796 | There's too much negative from both for me to vote for either. It's not true that we are required to vote for the lesser of two evils. There is a third choice on the ballot in 100% of election districts. They run a clean campaign, they are genuine, and I agree with 80+% of their proposed policies. Anyone who views their vote this year as the lesser of two evils is already willing to overlook things they feel are pretty bad. I encourage you to take even one hour to listen to recent speeches from Gary Johnson and Bill Weld on their official sites (not news sites). We probably all know the couple of things the media latched on to so they could discredit this team. If you invest a little more time for one more look, the worst that will happen is you don't hear enough that you like to feel like you have an alternative. The best that could happen is that you see enough that you like that you look forward to voting FOR someone rather than for evil and your conscience is clear. #JohnsonWeld2016

6 | Charles Frye | 12 | 1551527798200578_1551796524840372 | They made us all proud. When I was at Arlington National Cemetary I visited a memorial for them. These, and all flyers in WWII were true Heros. I know they are going to Heavan because they lived through hell on earth.
7 | John Arvizu | 6 | 1551527798200578_1552117848141573 | These brave men fought for America despite the racism they faced daily. When they got home they found jim crow laws and institutional racism kept them oppressed, segregated, and little credit for the amazing feats of bravery African Americans did during the war. Even though the 8th Air Force bomber crews knew of their bravery and exploits that saved 100s of bomber crews, the public didn't hear about it. Racism is taking its last breath in America. If trump were to win he would put civil rights back 100 years. This cannot happen! Vote for Hillary.

16 | Lisa Vipperman | 0 | 1551527798200578_1552317008121657 | At first they tended to only want AfricanAmericans to do menial tasks in the service, as I understand it, but these guys, like Doris Miller, showed true heroism.
17 | Anthony Verrette | 0 | 1551527798200578_1552004971486194 | A CONUNDRUMThe definition of the word conundrum is something that is puzzling or confusing.Here are six conundrums of socialism in the United States of America:1. America is capitalist and greedy - yet half of the population is subsidized.2. Half of the population is subsidized - yet they think they are victims.3. They think they are victims - yet their representatives run the government.4. Their representatives run the government - yet the poor keep getting poorer.5. The poor keep getting poorer - yet they have things that people in other countries only dream about.6. They have things that people in other countries only dream about - yet they want America to be more like those other countries.Think about it! And that, my friends, pretty much sums up the USA in the 21st century.  Makes you wonder who is doing the math. These three short sentences tell you a lot about the direction of our current government and cultural environment:1. We are advised to NOT judge ALL Muslims by the actions of a few lunatics, but we are encouraged to judge ALL gun owners by the actions of a few lunatics.Funny how that works.  And here's another one worth considering... 2. Seems we constantly hear about how Social Security is going to run out of money. But we never hear about welfare or food stamps running out of money!   What's interesting is the first group "worked for" their money, but the second didn't.Think  about it ... and last but not least:3.  Why are we cutting benefits for our veterans, no pay raises for our military and cutting our army to a level lower than before WWII, but we are not stopping the payments or benefits to illegal aliens?Am I the only one missing something?"If you do not take an interest in the affairs of your government, then you are doomed to live under the rule of fools." - Plato

I'm sick to death of the election circus, it is disgusting by everyone involved and is masking REAL news that NEEDS to be aired!!! The reality is someone will be voted in - while the indigenous people of our country are being abused, ignored, yet again having their rights and lands desecrated. Why don't you get news crews out there to show THE NATION what the world has already commented on. We fight in other countries for a people's rights - and carry on this nastiness in our back yard. Yet Americans get angry when someone kneels during the national anthem?! What hypocrisy. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1336613203035896&id=1090183327678886

So earlier today we learned that Attorney General Loretta Lynch was sent in to tell the FBI not to tell the public that Hillary Clinton was under investigation for her emails again.Right after that, however, Loretta Lynch was brought before Congress to explain why she okayed $1.7 Billion Dollars CASH of taxpayer money to be paid to Iran for a BAD deal.Trey Gowdy and Marco Rubio were leading the charge, and boy did they have some questions for her. These were straightforward questions about the legitimacy of the Iran Nuclear deal.And what did Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General of the United States do?That‚Äôs right. She took the Fifth Amendment, which allows you to avoid answering questions that may incriminate you.Well, Loretta, if you weren‚Äôt doing anything wrong or illegal you wouldn‚Äôt NEED to plead the 5th, would you?We gotta share this out and expose Hillary Clinton‚Äôs best friend for the lying weasel that she really is. America deserves better!PLEASE SHARE‚Ä¶..

1 | Sara Flowers | 0 | 1551461554873869_1552282998125058 | Read this (copied):I believe that Hillary Clinton will win the election in November, Then, sometime between November and January, Hillary will be indicted. The IRS is now investigating the Clinton Foundation and the whole e-mail thing isn‚Äôt over yet.‚Äù‚ÄúOnce under indictment she won‚Äôt be able to assume the Office of the President in January. Tim Kaine, who will not actually be the Vice President because neither he nor Hillary have been inaugurated, cannot assume the Presidency.‚Äù‚ÄúThe Speaker of the House can‚Äôt move up to it because there is already a sitting President and Vice President. So President Obama, in an Executive Order citing ‚Äúemergency situation,‚Äù gives himself another four years in office is the only way possible.‚ÄùI believe Obama has been planning this for a while now, knowing he has enough on Hillary to indict her. Had the Attorney General indicted her based on evidence from the FBI this plan wouldn‚Äôt have worked because the DNC would have quickly come up with another candidateIf you think about it, it‚Äôs not that outrageous. Many people on the left, including the President, want Obama to stay another four years. The law prohibits him from being re-elected so the only ways he can do it is by declaring martial law and suspending the election (which would be a very negative thing for the country) or to declare himself still President because the elected candidate cannot assume her duties.The latter makes more sense and is actually more feasible. And since it‚Äôs never been done before, it would set a precedent that would be difficult to challenge.Of course, if Trump wins the election none of this is going to happen. But what if I'm correct? Four more years of Obama and a mostly useless Republican House and Senate would give Obama the time he needs to continue destroying and changing the country to fit his stated goals.

And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that‚Äôs where we are‚Ä¶Is it a certainty that we won‚Äôt learn before the election? I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs a certainty we won‚Äôt learn before the election.IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT BERNSTEIN  IS A HILLARY SUPPORTER BUT EVEN HE KNOWS THIS IS HUGE. HE CALLED INTO CNN TO OFFER HIS ANALYSIS ‚ùóÔ∏è
