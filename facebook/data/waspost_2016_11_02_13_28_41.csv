Likely voters think Trump is more honest and trustworthy than Clinton, 46 to 38 percent.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Renita Kruger | 46 | 10154793901654729_10154793930599729 | The choice is clear: someone who used a private email server while Secretary of State or a white supremacist, racist, sexual predator, bankrupt, who will give tax breaks for the rich, doesn't believe in global warming, defrauded thousands of people, owes millions to Russia and is a ignorant lunatic!
2 | Sean Larabee | 24 | 10154793901654729_10154793968814729 | The fact that Donald Trump is seen as more honest than Hillary Clinton by an 8 percent margin defies the imagination. I have often defended the citizenry of our nation as people have attacked their intelligence, but for crying out loud what a bunch of imbecilic rubes. Trump lies about things he said 5 minutes ago, that are on video!! All the time and constantly and there are people that think he is honest?!! Defies the imagination it really does.
3 | Gabriela Arellano | 0 | 10154793901654729_10154794435549729 | The FBI should shut the f#k up and indict her after elections, if she gets to be president and they find decisive proves against her. Then the VP will assume the presidency. But launching all this news before election day influence not only who is gonna be the president, but also lots of many other official positions that can be ridiculously lean towards republicans just for FBI's loose lips.  A republican system of government has its resorts to deal with presidency vacancy. I rather follow the rules than steal from Democrats all the other official charges that are there in the ballot.
4 | Vinnie Moran | 5 | 10154793901654729_10154794041224729 | This is just complete bollocks. Are people this stupid? Or has TV news failed to cover Trump's dishonest business practices enough? The latter makes sense, although there's no denying there are an amazing number of idiots who mistake crude vulgarity for honesty. And why don't the polls include a question on how people feel about the Klu Klux Klan and white supremacists being enabled by Trump's rhetoric!
5 | Vee PM | 6 | 10154793901654729_10154793923854729 | I asked a young Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot.” Here is her answer: **  Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think. **  Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist. **  Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race. **  Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist. **  Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right. **  Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country. **  Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe? **  Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers. **  Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life. **  Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them. **  Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it. **  Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries. **  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.**  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success. And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary DOES than by what Trump SAYS. (Copied and pasted)
6 | Monica Andi | 18 | 10154793901654729_10154793902914729 | Without the minority vote and 91% white voters I have a better chance of winning the lotto than Trump winning The White House Plain and Simple❗️#ImWithNastyWoman
7 | Robyn Owen | 2 | 10154793901654729_10154793982664729 | But Fact Checking organizations say different, so I will stick with them rather than people. Kind of like Election Polls, prefer Logic and Scientific methodology.
8 | Adrian Leung | 0 | 10154793901654729_10154794172624729 | Our education system really needs a reboot and even though Clinton has her issues, Trump is a pathological liar, who lies about his lies!
9 | John G Schickler | 1 | 10154793901654729_10154794123909729 | Shows how easily people are mislead when lies are repeated over and over. Thump has lied about everything in his life and his beliefs yet stupid people think he is honest.
10 | Simon Anderson | 14 | 10154793901654729_10154793921954729 | An 8 point lead on honesty? If trumps mouth is moving, he's lying.
11 | John J. Coomer | 17 | 10154793901654729_10154793911639729 | An eight point edge in honesty for the man who is undeniably the biggest liar to ever seek the office of president of the United States. What does that tell you about the people that you inhabit this country with?
12 | Patrick Pierantozzi | 7 | 10154793901654729_10154793912904729 | Better still, what does it tell you about the US electorate?

15 | Steven Luk | 4 | 10154793901654729_10154793925989729 | That must be kidding. He lied in taxes， bankruptcies, sex.....

18 | Red Dickson | 3 | 10154793901654729_10154793964909729 | Trump more honest? All he does is lie. He's an unbroken stream of sociopathic consciousness.
19 | Luis Mena | 1 | 10154793901654729_10154793903949729 | What does... it do to trumps campaign.... he still needs a life boat to win this election.

Trump showed flashes of a cohesive closing argument in the final stage of a presidential campaign that is tightening with six days left.

2 | Sue Carpenter Sheerer | 2 | 10154792165479729_10154793739214729 | Maybe for once the American voters ought to think beyond both of these scandals and ask yourself who has the better platform?  Do you want to give  illegal immigrants a free ride and make them US Citizens, while we can't support our own American veterans?  Do you want to risk the influx of ISIS into our country because we didn't properly Vet incoming refugees or immigrants from Muslim countries?  Do you want our jobs and companies to keep closing and going to foreign countries where labor is 1/3 or less of our costs?  Do you want the Chinese companies to continue to buy our company stocks until they own them too?  Do you want to continue to DOUBLE our national Debt every 8 years?  It is up to 20 TRILLION Dollars.  Do you want to keep adding to the already 40+% of people dependent on the government for help? Do you want to keep Obamacare until our healthcare completely collapses or no one can afford it anymore?  Do you want to continue with the corruption in the government to the point where the media protects and hides it from the people?  Do you want to make AMERICA GREAT AGAIN or do you want to sit back  and watch because of some slanderous remarks Trump made that got twisted by the media.  You have a choice - make it matter.

6 | Alex Alvarado | 2 | 10154792165479729_10154792230509729 | So Donald Trump personality ... as an expert in psychologyAlberto Martin Rubin / LifederThe candidate for the US presidency by the Republican Party is analyzed by one of the most recognized American psychologists. What indicate his speeches on their way to be?Author of books such as 'intelligence applied' or 'The nature of hate', American Robert Sternberg is one of the most renowned psychologists on the international scene. specialized professor at Yale University, is famous for its many research on topics such as intelligence, creativity, life partner or success, besides being president of the American Psychological Association -APA-.In this interview, conducted by Lifeder, you'll know your views on some aspects of political life that you might like to see from the perspective of psychology.Question: Mention in your web five ways that leaders can fail, what do you think they lack the current leaders? And what is your opinion of your country?I can not speak for the Spanish particular situation, but the aspects evaluated in elections often are not those that lead to a good and successful leadership. We see this in our own country US, at this time, where the main candidate of one of the political parties shows many of the characteristic attributes of a demagogue. Leaders are better and more effective when making ethical judgments and wise, but the wise and balanced candidates tend to be less exciting and flashy.On the contrary, narcissists candidates, whose main concern in life is to love themselves and only themselves--and often are very convincing because they will say or do whatever it takes to win and get power. They do not care at all for others, so do not feel bad about deceiving. For them it is not good leadership, but rather self-improvement. Ethical principles are not important to them, as they discovered some European countries during the Second World War, and to discover in the US future""Q: It would be very beneficial to the citizens we knew distinguish an ethical leader of one narcissistic, how can we know?It is not so difficult to know if a leader is wise and ethical. The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. In the case of the United States, an individual who has broken four companies and impoverished many investors in reference to Donald Trump- it is neither wise nor ethical.The problem is that it seems that people do not care, people preferring to appeal to your emotions, fantasies, and sometimes their prejudices. It is a sad commentary on the electorate, but it is.What is especially strange in our elections is that candidates who lead -fundamentalismo Christian-evangelical voters, do not show any of the characteristics that Jesus modeled-charity, humility, concern for others, wisdom. The irony is that it seems that people who claim to value the most fundamental of Christianity attributes, not values ​​in their presidential candidates. It is as if the message of Jesus were completely lost in practice, can that much of that message is only theoretical.

8 | Danny Babcock | 2 | 10154792165479729_10154793493194729 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!Copy Paste Share!

Reportedly, a very good and anonymous source is saying that the email scandal, as bad as it is, is just a diversion from the Clinton Foundation whose tentacles reach far and wide in DC and across many waters....and especially with Trump in office, lots of heads are going to roll and political careers are going to be flushed and America is going to be really shocked at the dept and width of the corruption. The Clintons have almost single handedly soiled the perception of America around the world and weakened our national security and caused a Constitutional crisis all for the sake of more money and more power for them and their allies. The Good Book says that the way of the transgressor is hard.
11 | Vee PM | 2 | 10154792165479729_10154793928569729 | The Democrat Party that my grandfather supported is dead. The "new" Democrat Party leans way too far left and is corrupting America. They believe in power more than they do in service to the people who vote for them. They have proven - time after time they are corrupt. It is like a cancer, you cannot just remove a portion of it and hope for the best. The HEART of the CANCER needs to be cut out and COMPLETELY REMOVED. The Democrats have shown repeatedly - most especially in this 2016 election - that they value their ability to corrupt and control far more than they value putting AMERICA FIRST.

Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! What do you see? Before you deny its not true,...How did Saul Alinsky know the U.S. was heading toward a Social State 46+ years ago? It's a good question to think about!!!Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"!

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother’s Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Suzette Henry | 8 | 10154791039519729_10154791064994729 | It's clear RUSSIANS are running this election ..People wake up I am sure GOP has garbage too but because Putin cannot control Hillary he will do anything to help Trump... Wikileaks = Russians = Putin
2 | Ann Abraham Brooks | 7 | 10154791039519729_10154791114109729 | I wonder if Trump's upcoming trials for child rape and cheating people through his Trump U scheme are a conversation starter as well. Maybe his tax returns might turn up in conversation as well?
3 | Carolyn Peterson | 2 | 10154791039519729_10154791348829729 | OMG OMG they found more emails to Hillary on a lap top! A lap top, I tell you! Pffttt Really? This is driving everyone nuts? Unless you can show me an email from Hillary saying that she passing classified emails out like Halloween candy and is loving it, don't bother me with this crap.
4 | Glenn Hassig | 0 | 10154791039519729_10154793659809729 | They are investigating an unsecured computer in a private home that could have classified emails on it originating from Hillary's personal server!!! This is a very serious issue and if true Hillary will be brought up on charges and lose her security clearance. Therefore will be removed from office! This is no small matter and the voters have every right to know.
5 | Sue Carpenter Sheerer | 0 | 10154791039519729_10154793741284729 | Maybe for once the American voters ought to think beyond both of these scandals and ask yourself who has the better platform?  Do you want to give  illegal immigrants a free ride and make them US Citizens, while we can't support our own American veterans?  Do you want to risk the influx of ISIS into our country because we didn't properly Vet incoming refugees or immigrants from Muslim countries?  Do you want our jobs and companies to keep closing and going to foreign countries where labor is 1/3 or less of our costs?  Do you want the Chinese companies to continue to buy our company stocks until they own them too?  Do you want to continue to DOUBLE our national Debt every 8 years?  It is up to 20 TRILLION Dollars.  Do you want to keep adding to the already 40+% of people dependent on the government for help? Do you want to keep Obamacare until our healthcare completely collapses or no one can afford it anymore?  Do you want to continue with the corruption in the government to the point where the media protects and hides it from the people?  Do you want to make AMERICA GREAT AGAIN or do you want to sit back  and watch because of some slanderous remarks Trump made that got twisted by the media.  You have a choice - make it matter.
6 | Donna Macfarlane | 1 | 10154791039519729_10154792290154729 | This will be life under Trump: terrifying brinksmanship with North Korea, falling victim to the manipulations of Putin, repeal and No replacement of health care for the uninsured, tax breaks for the 1 per centers, ugly home grown violence as a result of the 16 million being forcibly evicted, a shortage of labour to keep industry operating, cancelled trade agreements so no market for American products, cancelled mutual defence treaties, resulting in international instability, a coarsening of the American discourse, open season on Muslims, women, people of colour, and yes even obese people. But yeah, I guess the email protocol may be strictly observed. Look, you don't have to like Clinton, but Trump is a dangerous fascist. If Americans have a choice, and you do, bear with Clinton for 4 years and work to defeat her next election. Choosing Trump is leap into the abyss.
7 | Sue Carpenter Sheerer | 0 | 10154791039519729_10154793824089729 | Hillary supporters would stand by her even if it was announced she had murdered someone.. oh wait, she did.. Benghazi.. lest we forget. Oh, and in case you were wondering, that is how she got in this HOT email mess to begin with. While under investigation for that they found out she was using a PRIVATE, ILLEGAL server to conduct GOVERNMENT business on. (WHY, oh WHY? Hiding something?) Yes, she lied about BOTH things and now she has to answer for it. She tried to dodge and hide but the Trump Train is going to DRAIN THE SWAMP! You will see the biggest scandal unfold in American history! Why do you want to protect someone who doesn't give a shit about you and your safety? Bet you'd feel differently if it was your kids who died at her hands.

10 | Patrick Pierantozzi | 2 | 10154791039519729_10154791276629729 | That's ALL republicans have. E-mails. When was the last time you heard a republican actually talking about policy and governing?
11 | Rode Tmcil | 3 | 10154791039519729_10154791463184729 | The FBI should be investigating Donald Trump and his criminal actions! Not Hillary! Hillary Clinton for president!
12 | Richard Klein | 3 | 10154791039519729_10154791201084729 | It's easy to say you are all for fiscal responsibility, free markets, and everything the republicans promise. Republicans all claim they know how economics works. To them it means to give away for pretty much free public and, private lands to Corporate America along with the people’s personal wealth. What makes it really bad is Corporate America demands that the economy works this way or else they are not going to participate. Notice the stock market always tanks every time there is good news for Trump? This is what Republicans bring to our lives. Complete uncertainty and, disorder. It makes it really hard for people like the democrats who are trying to work economic prosperity for the country from the middle class out. We need to be Stronger Together with Hillary Clinton to stop republicans from throwing our good programs out the window for their own personal gain. Hillary Clinton is really good about getting some of this money back and, re-distributing this money around the world to places that need it. Hillary Clinton knows what she is doing and, has easily defeated republicans on everything they have thrown at her. Hillary Clinton is going to be our next President. Let’s all unite together democrats, independence and, republicans so, that we can grow the economy from the middle class out. Hillary Clinton will stop Corporate America from refusing to invest in America. Look! you can’t pull your money out of the economy so, why should Corporate America be allowed too. You are 100% invested in the economy rather you know it or, not. It just makes economic sense that you see we are all in this together. This is the only way prosperity at its best can work for us all. Are you going to just sit there and, watch your children’s futures be stripped and, drained while Corporate America continues to make a fortune off of financial markets and, never passing one dime to main street? Republicans seem to take great pride in themselves not to improve anything and, only make things worse. Everybody knows about Obamacare and, republicans refusal to make it better. Obamacare sat a good standard for medical healthcare insurance for all of us. You can’t be sold junk medical healthcare insurance anymore. It is not the failure that republicans claim. This is the breakdown of Obamacare / ACA for 2017. 16% of people who get their healthcare through the market place may be affected by a rate increase. Less than 1.5 million people may want to change to another plan or, pay the increase. Now consider the fact that there will be over 20 million people getting their healthcare through the Obamacare / ACA. How is that a complete failure? Over the fact that it sat a good standard for good healthcare compared to buying below standard medical healthcare with junk medical insurance. Obamacare / ACA is by no means a failure.  Hillary will stop republicans from defunding all the good America has to offer and, build the economy from the middle class out. I am sick and tired of watching Republicans defund our services only to liquidate the assets and, give these funds away to someone from a foreign country or, off shore. Hillary Clinton is wise and will put a stop to these republican renegade ideas and, put America’s wealth back into to the pockets of the middle class. That's why I'm standing Stronger Together with Hillary Clinton and, the Democrats. (The party of empathy)

Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! What do you see? Before you deny its not true,...How did Saul Alinsky know the U.S. was heading toward a Social State 46+ years ago? It's a good question to think about!!!Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"!

20 | Richard Klein | 1 | 10154791039519729_10154791200399729 | People understand Stronger Together is the grand design for human survival and, a peace of mind. I love I'm with the party of beautiful caring people with a great convention and, historical speeches. I fear nothing. I don’t have near the women problem Trump has. The sky is not falling. Yes, I favor the democrat issues. My healthcare is good and, I feel great. I selected my own primary care doctor and, gained many other essential things.          So, if you think some of Trump’s voters are going to stop us from being Stronger Together, you are so wrong! We don’t mean any ill feelings. I realize some may have gotten a grudge. But, that’s you and, not us. Democrats did not   try to default on the nation’s debt. The debt is a serious matter. This tells me the republicans do not have educated thinkers to run this country. The country could have been seriously harmed or, destroyed.          The Republicans will ride any wave that comes their way if it will grab them power, including electing this habitual sexist liar Trump for President. Republicans think they don’t have to take any responsibility for anything no matter how heinous it is. Republicans may have another 8 years to re-think their, “I got an axe to grind!” and their, “hate” behavior. The world is much better and, bigger than what the republicans can see. So, I don’t expect them to see, Stronger Together with her is truly the only place for me.

My wife just got a letter from her health insurance company announcing that her rates were skyrocketing -- up more than 200% for next year. Most people would just clean their underwear and call their insurance company after the election. We called the next day and learned that the news wasn't nearly as bad. She could get slightly better coverage from her current company for just slightly more.Why would the insurance company send out the most dire letter possible unless they wanted to frighten people and maybe get them to vote against Hillary? (Not that she actually DESERVES anyone's vote, but I hate unfairness! Insurance companies HATE Obamacare and are probably mostly Republican.)

But yeah, I guess the email protocol may be strictly observed. Look, you don't have to like Clinton, but Trump is a dangerous fascist. If Americans have a choice, and you do, bear with Clinton for 4 years and work to defeat her next election. Choosing Trump is leap into the abyss.

10 | Rebecca Laskey | 0 | 10154790966954729_10154792129124729 | PUTIN’S PUPPET!  “OCTOBER SURPRISE” REVEALS FBI IS PROBING TRUMP AND HIS AIDES’ RUSSIAN TIES:The month of October gave us multiple election shockers, from the Donald Trump Access Hollywood video to FBI director James Comey’s announcement on Friday that there are more Hillary Clinton emails under investigation — and they involve none other than Anthony Weiner. But since the 2016 election is all about extremes, on the final night of the month there were multiple last-minute “October surprises” about Trump’s ties to Russia, with varying levels of sexiness (we mean that metaphorically and, sadly, literally).While accusing Comey of potentially breaking the law on Sunday night, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid alleged that the FBI is sitting on “explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.” Reid has been known to make wild accusations close to an election, but apparently this one was (sort of) true. According to the New York Times, the FBI spent much of the summer investigating the many allegations regarding Trump’s ties to Russia. The wide-reaching probe, which is reportedly ongoing, looked at his advisers, his financial activities, and the hack of Democratic officials, but so far it has not turned up proof that Trump is in cahoots with Vladimir Putin. Per the Times:Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.Intelligence sources told the Times that Trump aides’ alleged Russian affiliations are what initially prompted them to open the investigation. Part of the probe involves former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who worked for Ukrainian president and Putin ally Viktor Yanukovych before he was ousted in 2014. Manafort resigned in August amid allegations that he helped Ukraine’s pro-Russian political party lobby the U.S. government without disclosing his role, which is illegal. Hours before the Times piece was published, NBC News reported that the FBI is conducting a “preliminary inquiry” into Manafort’s overseas business activities, but it has “not blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation.”Manafort has maintained that he has never had ties to Putin or his government, and in a statement to NBC he dismissed the allegations as “Democratic propaganda.” “None of it is true,” he said of NBC’s report. “There’s no investigation going on by the FBI that I’m aware of.”In August and September, congressional leaders were briefed on potential financial ties between Russia and people in Trump’s orbit, according to the Times. That discussion included a computer back channel between the Trump Organization and Russia’s Alfa Bank. In one of the night’s other big reveals, Slate’s Franklin Foer posted a complex report on how computer scientists investigating Russia’s alleged election hacking accidentally discovered the link between Trump’s business and one of Russia’s largest banks.Foer’s conclusion was that it’s unclear why servers at Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization were communicating with each other, “but it deserves further explanation.” However, the Times threw cold water on the story, reporting, “The F.B.I. ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.”The Trump campaign and Alfa Bank denied having any business dealings. The bank said it had hired the cybersecurity company Mandiant, and their “working hypothesis” is that the activity was caused by “a spam attack targeted at Alfa Bank by a marketing server, which triggered security software.If mysterious functions of the domain name system do not qualify as a thrilling October surprise, Mother Jones’s Monday night report on spies and Russian sabotage more than makes up for it. David Corn talked to a former senior intelligence officer who specialized in Russian counterintelligence for a Western country. The former spy says he recently gave the FBI memos, based on his talks with Russian sources, that claim the Russians have been grooming Trump for years. Per Mother Jones:The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer’s conversations with Russian sources, noted, “Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.” It maintained that Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.” It claimed that Russian intelligence had “compromised” Trump during his visits to Moscow and could “blackmail him.” It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on “bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.”The ex-spy says the FBI asked him for more information in August, and he’s continued to share information with the bureau. “It’s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,” he says.An even more sensational rumor sprung from this report as journalists speculated on how Trump may have been “compromised”:Monday’s various revelations fed into a narrative the Clinton campaign and Democratic allies had been pushing hard all day: that she is the victim of a “blatant double standard” when it comes to FBI disclosures. Comey provided extensive updates on the Clinton email investigation, yet he refused to confirm that the FBI was investigating Trump’s ties to Russia during testimony before Congress in September. Furthermore, on Monday, CNBC reported that Comey was so sensitive about revealing information that could influence the election that he successfully argued against including the FBI in a statement that said the “U.S. intelligence community” was confident that Russia was behind the hacks of Democratic officials.Speaking of the hacks, the Times says that federal investigators now believe Russia’s goal was “to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine America’s standing in the world more broadly,” not to aid Trump’s campaign. That sparked disagreement over whether there’s any difference between the two goals.Others say there’s already ample reason to be concerned about Trump’s ties to Russia — and it has nothing to do with claims made by shadowy intelligence sources. Vox’s Matt Yglesias said he’s more interested in Trump’s stated policies toward Russia than theories about what motivated them.Talking Points Memo’s Josh Marshall agreed, saying Trump’s relationship with Russia should be a huge issue for voters, even without Monday night’s barrage of allegations:… if Russia has coopted or cultivated or compromised Trump that is a threat of the highest order. I can’t go on the word of an unnamed retired spy whose identity we don’t know, whose motives we can’t interrogate and whose evidence we can’t see. But I don’t think I need additional evidence. What’s been in plain sight for weeks, actually months, is more than enough to ring every alarm bell. And yet, with all the hints and arch remarks about Russia, the alarms have barely been rung.TRUMP IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN DECADES, THAT HAS NOT RELEASED HIS TAXES.

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother’s Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media!

But there’s one area where every living, former president, Republican and Democrat, have found something to agree on. They all agree that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president of the United States.Those former presidents include Carter, Bush Sr., Clinton, and Bush Jr. The current president, Barack Obama, has also weighed in, and he thinks Trump is unqualified to lead this great country as well. If anyone understands the demands of the presidency and what it takes, it’s a former president.These men have been there and done that. They know what the job entails, and all agree Donald Trump would be an embarrassment and a disaster as president. Moreover, knowing Trump’s history, he would use the presidency to line his pockets.That said, read the following comments on those seeking your vote:Jimmy Carter on Hillary Clinton:“I've known Hillary for decades — and her record as a public servant is superb. In 1977, I appointed her to the board of the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a nonprofit that provides legal assistance to Americans in need — she went on to become the first woman to chair the board. Over her tenure, funding for the LSC tripled, allowing the organization to expand legal aid to every congressional district, and handle 1.5 million cases for poor clients each year. As First Lady, Clinton continued to advocate for legal services funding.”Mitt Romney on Trump:“If we make improvident choices, the bright horizon I foresee will never materialize. Let me put it plainly, if we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.“A few examples: His proposed 35% tariff-like penalties would instigate a trade war that would raise prices for consumers, kill export jobs, and lead entrepreneurs and businesses to flee America. “His tax plan, in combination with his refusal to reform entitlements and to honestly address spending would balloon the deficit and the national debt. So even as Donald Trump has offered very few specific economic plans, what little he has said is enough to know that he would be very bad for American workers and for American families.“But wait, you say, isn't he a huge business success that knows what he's talking about? No he isn't. His bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who worked for them. He inherited his business, he didn't create it. And what ever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there's Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks, and Trump Mortgage? A business genius he is not.”Michelle Obama on Trump:“If a candidate is erratic and threatening; if a candidate traffics in prejudice, fears and lies on the campaign trail; if a candidate thinks that not paying taxes makes you smart, or that it’s good business when people lose their homes; if a candidate regularly and flippantly makes cruel and insulting comments about women, about how we look, how we act — well, sadly, that’s who that candidate really is,” Mrs. Obama told an audience of mostly students at La Salle University in Philadelphia. “That is the kind of president they will be.”Trump’s appeal is really not about him; it’s about bigots and their desireisn’t based on his competence or lack thereof. It’s based largely on racial prejudice. It’s based on the racial prejudice Republicans have stoked throughout Pres. Obama’s terms, and it’s based on a prejudice that’s aimed at others who are not white.In exchange for making bigots feel “normal,” Trump supporters have shown they will tolerate even the most gutter, degenerate, juvenile, and sexually abusive behavior from Trump towards women. On November 8, the majority of decent Americans of all colors can reject all the divisions that Trump represents.
3 | Donna Macfarlane | 3 | 10154790900419729_10154792242439729 | This will be life under Trump: terrifying brinksmanship with North Korea, falling victim to the manipulations of Putin, repeal and No replacement of health care for the uninsured, tax breaks for the 1 per centers, ugly home grown violence as a result of the 16 million being forcibly evicted, a shortage of labour to keep industry operating, cancelled trade agreements so no market for American products, cancelled mutual defence treaties, resulting in international instability, a coarsening of the American discourse, open season on Muslims, women, people of colour, and yes even obese people. But yeah, I guess the email protocol may be strictly observed. Look, you don't have to like Clinton, but Trump is a dangerous fascist. If Americans have a choice, and you do, bear with Clinton for 4 years and work to defeat her next election. Choosing Trump is leap into the abyss.

6 | Sue Carpenter Sheerer | 0 | 10154790900419729_10154793741519729 | Maybe for once the American voters ought to think beyond both of these scandals and ask yourself who has the better platform?  Do you want to give  illegal immigrants a free ride and make them US Citizens, while we can't support our own American veterans?  Do you want to risk the influx of ISIS into our country because we didn't properly Vet incoming refugees or immigrants from Muslim countries?  Do you want our jobs and companies to keep closing and going to foreign countries where labor is 1/3 or less of our costs?  Do you want the Chinese companies to continue to buy our company stocks until they own them too?  Do you want to continue to DOUBLE our national Debt every 8 years?  It is up to 20 TRILLION Dollars.  Do you want to keep adding to the already 40+% of people dependent on the government for help? Do you want to keep Obamacare until our healthcare completely collapses or no one can afford it anymore?  Do you want to continue with the corruption in the government to the point where the media protects and hides it from the people?  Do you want to make AMERICA GREAT AGAIN or do you want to sit back  and watch because of some slanderous remarks Trump made that got twisted by the media.  You have a choice - make it matter.

If another person was behind an event like that they would have called it performing an act of terrorism and the victims of that day should press charges and sue for damages. Hillary Clinton is a criminal and will not help you unless you are paying her or she is paying you to commit a crime.

Benghazi.. lest we forget. Oh, and in case you were wondering, that is how she got in this HOT email mess to begin with. While under investigation for that they found out she was using a PRIVATE, ILLEGAL server to conduct GOVERNMENT business on. (WHY, oh WHY? Hiding something?) Yes, she lied about BOTH things and now she has to answer for it. She tried to dodge and hide but the Trump Train is going to DRAIN THE SWAMP! You will see the biggest scandal unfold in American history! Why do you want to protect someone who doesn't give a shit about you and your safety? Bet you'd feel differently if it was your kids who died at her hands.

He brings the Tasmanian-Devil to mind… he acts and talks just like the cartoon character. Hillary Clinton isn’t perfect, but after the three debates, it’s very clear Trump doesn’t have the intelligence, or temperament to be President. Now think about Trump’s daily ranting and tweeting about everyone and thing…’’ they’re “out to get him”, it's the Media, it’s the Clintons, it’s the Establishment, it's rigged polls, his shorts are too tight, it’s those women or/and it’s the corrupt system that's doing it to little Donald Trump! - “That person in your mind’s eye… that – is - Donald Trump”!  Does that imagine fit your vision of someone who should be President of the United States?  --- I sure don’t think so! -  Please VOTE!!!

20 | Rebecca Laskey | 1 | 10154790900419729_10154792135534729 | PUTIN’S PUPPET!  “OCTOBER SURPRISE” REVEALS FBI IS PROBING TRUMP AND HIS AIDES’ RUSSIAN TIES:The month of October gave us multiple election shockers, from the Donald Trump Access Hollywood video to FBI director James Comey’s announcement on Friday that there are more Hillary Clinton emails under investigation — and they involve none other than Anthony Weiner. But since the 2016 election is all about extremes, on the final night of the month there were multiple last-minute “October surprises” about Trump’s ties to Russia, with varying levels of sexiness (we mean that metaphorically and, sadly, literally).While accusing Comey of potentially breaking the law on Sunday night, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid alleged that the FBI is sitting on “explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.” Reid has been known to make wild accusations close to an election, but apparently this one was (sort of) true. According to the New York Times, the FBI spent much of the summer investigating the many allegations regarding Trump’s ties to Russia. The wide-reaching probe, which is reportedly ongoing, looked at his advisers, his financial activities, and the hack of Democratic officials, but so far it has not turned up proof that Trump is in cahoots with Vladimir Putin. Per the Times:Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.Intelligence sources told the Times that Trump aides’ alleged Russian affiliations are what initially prompted them to open the investigation. Part of the probe involves former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who worked for Ukrainian president and Putin ally Viktor Yanukovych before he was ousted in 2014. Manafort resigned in August amid allegations that he helped Ukraine’s pro-Russian political party lobby the U.S. government without disclosing his role, which is illegal. Hours before the Times piece was published, NBC News reported that the FBI is conducting a “preliminary inquiry” into Manafort’s overseas business activities, but it has “not blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation.”Manafort has maintained that he has never had ties to Putin or his government, and in a statement to NBC he dismissed the allegations as “Democratic propaganda.” “None of it is true,” he said of NBC’s report. “There’s no investigation going on by the FBI that I’m aware of.”In August and September, congressional leaders were briefed on potential financial ties between Russia and people in Trump’s orbit, according to the Times. That discussion included a computer back channel between the Trump Organization and Russia’s Alfa Bank. In one of the night’s other big reveals, Slate’s Franklin Foer posted a complex report on how computer scientists investigating Russia’s alleged election hacking accidentally discovered the link between Trump’s business and one of Russia’s largest banks.Foer’s conclusion was that it’s unclear why servers at Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization were communicating with each other, “but it deserves further explanation.” However, the Times threw cold water on the story, reporting, “The F.B.I. ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.”The Trump campaign and Alfa Bank denied having any business dealings. The bank said it had hired the cybersecurity company Mandiant, and their “working hypothesis” is that the activity was caused by “a spam attack targeted at Alfa Bank by a marketing server, which triggered security software.If mysterious functions of the domain name system do not qualify as a thrilling October surprise, Mother Jones’s Monday night report on spies and Russian sabotage more than makes up for it. David Corn talked to a former senior intelligence officer who specialized in Russian counterintelligence for a Western country. The former spy says he recently gave the FBI memos, based on his talks with Russian sources, that claim the Russians have been grooming Trump for years. Per Mother Jones:The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer’s conversations with Russian sources, noted, “Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.” It maintained that Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.” It claimed that Russian intelligence had “compromised” Trump during his visits to Moscow and could “blackmail him.” It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on “bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.”The ex-spy says the FBI asked him for more information in August, and he’s continued to share information with the bureau. “It’s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,” he says.An even more sensational rumor sprung from this report as journalists speculated on how Trump may have been “compromised”:Monday’s various revelations fed into a narrative the Clinton campaign and Democratic allies had been pushing hard all day: that she is the victim of a “blatant double standard” when it comes to FBI disclosures. Comey provided extensive updates on the Clinton email investigation, yet he refused to confirm that the FBI was investigating Trump’s ties to Russia during testimony before Congress in September. Furthermore, on Monday, CNBC reported that Comey was so sensitive about revealing information that could influence the election that he successfully argued against including the FBI in a statement that said the “U.S. intelligence community” was confident that Russia was behind the hacks of Democratic officials.Speaking of the hacks, the Times says that federal investigators now believe Russia’s goal was “to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine America’s standing in the world more broadly,” not to aid Trump’s campaign. That sparked disagreement over whether there’s any difference between the two goals.Others say there’s already ample reason to be concerned about Trump’s ties to Russia — and it has nothing to do with claims made by shadowy intelligence sources. Vox’s Matt Yglesias said he’s more interested in Trump’s stated policies toward Russia than theories about what motivated them.Talking Points Memo’s Josh Marshall agreed, saying Trump’s relationship with Russia should be a huge issue for voters, even without Monday night’s barrage of allegations:… if Russia has coopted or cultivated or compromised Trump that is a threat of the highest order. I can’t go on the word of an unnamed retired spy whose identity we don’t know, whose motives we can’t interrogate and whose evidence we can’t see. But I don’t think I need additional evidence. What’s been in plain sight for weeks, actually months, is more than enough to ring every alarm bell. And yet, with all the hints and arch remarks about Russia, the alarms have barely been rung.TRUMP IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN DECADES, THAT HAS NOT RELEASED HIS TAXES.

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother’s Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

The real question should be What did the Director know? And when did he know it? It turns out that the FBI knew for weeks about this new batch of emails. Comey waited until now to release the news so as to inflict as much damage to the Clinton campaign as possible. When told by his subordinates about deep troubling ties between the Russian Security Services and the Trump campaign, he refuses to publicize it for fear of hurting Trump's chances at the polls. DOUBLE STANDARD.

I think CO is a toss up right now)... but what this means is that the red candidate can get the pro verbal 'inside stright' of the big battle ground states and still lose-- which to me is astounding... Clinton campaign thinks they are going to get over 300.....

I voted for Bernie Sanders" - if Sanders were not edged out by the likes of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Donna Brazile and the media collusion against him and the disenfranchisement of independent voters from partaking in a Primary Season they as taxpayers have helped fund....Then this wouldn't be a "close race". The primary polling suggested it all along so stop acting gobsmacked over the fact Clinton is barely staying afloat in the toilet of American politics next to a fascist like Trump. If Sanders were permitted the candidacy - he'd have won handily over Trump and we'd be all the better for it. And sure, you can say "But he didn't win"....to which I respond "But Clinton is still barely afloat"

This is a very serious issue and if true Hillary will be brought up on charges and lose her security clearance. Therefore will be removed from office!

20 | Rebecca Laskey | 0 | 10154790454984729_10154792137564729 | PUTIN’S PUPPET!  “OCTOBER SURPRISE” REVEALS FBI IS PROBING TRUMP AND HIS AIDES’ RUSSIAN TIES:The month of October gave us multiple election shockers, from the Donald Trump Access Hollywood video to FBI director James Comey’s announcement on Friday that there are more Hillary Clinton emails under investigation — and they involve none other than Anthony Weiner. But since the 2016 election is all about extremes, on the final night of the month there were multiple last-minute “October surprises” about Trump’s ties to Russia, with varying levels of sexiness (we mean that metaphorically and, sadly, literally).While accusing Comey of potentially breaking the law on Sunday night, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid alleged that the FBI is sitting on “explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.” Reid has been known to make wild accusations close to an election, but apparently this one was (sort of) true. According to the New York Times, the FBI spent much of the summer investigating the many allegations regarding Trump’s ties to Russia. The wide-reaching probe, which is reportedly ongoing, looked at his advisers, his financial activities, and the hack of Democratic officials, but so far it has not turned up proof that Trump is in cahoots with Vladimir Putin. Per the Times:Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.Intelligence sources told the Times that Trump aides’ alleged Russian affiliations are what initially prompted them to open the investigation. Part of the probe involves former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who worked for Ukrainian president and Putin ally Viktor Yanukovych before he was ousted in 2014. Manafort resigned in August amid allegations that he helped Ukraine’s pro-Russian political party lobby the U.S. government without disclosing his role, which is illegal. Hours before the Times piece was published, NBC News reported that the FBI is conducting a “preliminary inquiry” into Manafort’s overseas business activities, but it has “not blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation.”Manafort has maintained that he has never had ties to Putin or his government, and in a statement to NBC he dismissed the allegations as “Democratic propaganda.” “None of it is true,” he said of NBC’s report. “There’s no investigation going on by the FBI that I’m aware of.”In August and September, congressional leaders were briefed on potential financial ties between Russia and people in Trump’s orbit, according to the Times. That discussion included a computer back channel between the Trump Organization and Russia’s Alfa Bank. In one of the night’s other big reveals, Slate’s Franklin Foer posted a complex report on how computer scientists investigating Russia’s alleged election hacking accidentally discovered the link between Trump’s business and one of Russia’s largest banks.Foer’s conclusion was that it’s unclear why servers at Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization were communicating with each other, “but it deserves further explanation.” However, the Times threw cold water on the story, reporting, “The F.B.I. ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.”The Trump campaign and Alfa Bank denied having any business dealings. The bank said it had hired the cybersecurity company Mandiant, and their “working hypothesis” is that the activity was caused by “a spam attack targeted at Alfa Bank by a marketing server, which triggered security software.If mysterious functions of the domain name system do not qualify as a thrilling October surprise, Mother Jones’s Monday night report on spies and Russian sabotage more than makes up for it. David Corn talked to a former senior intelligence officer who specialized in Russian counterintelligence for a Western country. The former spy says he recently gave the FBI memos, based on his talks with Russian sources, that claim the Russians have been grooming Trump for years. Per Mother Jones:The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer’s conversations with Russian sources, noted, “Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.” It maintained that Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.” It claimed that Russian intelligence had “compromised” Trump during his visits to Moscow and could “blackmail him.” It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on “bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.”The ex-spy says the FBI asked him for more information in August, and he’s continued to share information with the bureau. “It’s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,” he says.An even more sensational rumor sprung from this report as journalists speculated on how Trump may have been “compromised”:Monday’s various revelations fed into a narrative the Clinton campaign and Democratic allies had been pushing hard all day: that she is the victim of a “blatant double standard” when it comes to FBI disclosures. Comey provided extensive updates on the Clinton email investigation, yet he refused to confirm that the FBI was investigating Trump’s ties to Russia during testimony before Congress in September. Furthermore, on Monday, CNBC reported that Comey was so sensitive about revealing information that could influence the election that he successfully argued against including the FBI in a statement that said the “U.S. intelligence community” was confident that Russia was behind the hacks of Democratic officials.Speaking of the hacks, the Times says that federal investigators now believe Russia’s goal was “to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine America’s standing in the world more broadly,” not to aid Trump’s campaign. That sparked disagreement over whether there’s any difference between the two goals.Others say there’s already ample reason to be concerned about Trump’s ties to Russia — and it has nothing to do with claims made by shadowy intelligence sources. Vox’s Matt Yglesias said he’s more interested in Trump’s stated policies toward Russia than theories about what motivated them.Talking Points Memo’s Josh Marshall agreed, saying Trump’s relationship with Russia should be a huge issue for voters, even without Monday night’s barrage of allegations:… if Russia has coopted or cultivated or compromised Trump that is a threat of the highest order. I can’t go on the word of an unnamed retired spy whose identity we don’t know, whose motives we can’t interrogate and whose evidence we can’t see. But I don’t think I need additional evidence. What’s been in plain sight for weeks, actually months, is more than enough to ring every alarm bell. And yet, with all the hints and arch remarks about Russia, the alarms have barely been rung.TRUMP IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN DECADES, THAT HAS NOT RELEASED HIS TAXES.  WHAT IS HE HIDING???#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumPutin#TrumpIsPutinsPuppet

And certainly the swamp will not be drained....but the muck and stench will just grow worse and worse.

Reportedly, a very good and anonymous source is saying that the email scandal, as bad as it is, is just a diversion from the Clinton Foundation whose tentacles reach far and wide in DC and across many waters....and especially with Trump in office, lots of heads are going to roll and political careers are going to be flushed and America is going to be really shocked at the dept and width of the corruption. The Clintons have almost single handedly soiled the perception of America around the world and weakened our national security and caused a Constitutional crisis all for the sake of more money and more power for them and their allies. The Good Book says that the way of the transgressor is hard.

Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! What do you see? Before you deny its not true,...How did Saul Alinsky know the U.S. was heading toward a Social State 46+ years ago? It's a good question to think about!!!Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"!

But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US.

She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected!

For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleeding the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE!

What They Found Will RUIN HER LIFE Share on Facebook You’ve probably heard by now that NYPD obtained Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin’s home devices as part of an investigation into Weiner’s alleged “sexting” with underage girls… But the cops didn’t stop with them!To their complete shock, the NYPD ended up finding and raiding HILLARY’S property on those devices in the form of 650k emails connected to her personal email server…Now her private property is in the hands of the NYPD and FBI!An NYPD source just claimed that within the emails on that device, Hillary and Bill are directly implicated ins a MASSIVE child sex/trafficking ring along with their friend, and convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. (See Below)According to the source,“…It’s much more vile and serious than classified material on Weiner’s device. The emails DETAIL the trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary on their pedophile billionaire friend’s plane, the Lolita Express.”“We’re talking an international child enslavement and sex ring“These claims were backed up by other NYPD sources as well:Jeff Epstein is a level-3 registered sex offender and the media ignores the fact hat Bill Clinton flew 26 times on Epstein’s private Jet and allegedly visited Epstein’s sex slave island. Now that Hillary has also been directly implicated, the media cannot ignore this any longer! The NYPD source makes specific claims about her involvement. He says, “Hillary has a well documented predilection for underage girls, and Mr. Weiner could not bear to see those details deleted.” This will end up being the biggest scandal uncovered in election history! THIS NYPD SOURCE IS CLAIMING HILLARY IS A PEDOPHILE!SHARE THIS on Facebook because the media refuses to cover it! From Anon News,Sex rings are popular in all governments, but pedophilia is primarily in British parliament & Saudi Arabia, and that’s why HRC and BC love foreign donors so much. They get paid in children as well as money. Dig deep and you can find it. It will sicken you.

HMMMMM. REALLY? Yet a father/mentor teaching his young son that grabbing a woman "by the p*ssy" and promoting sexual assault is acceptable?

2 | Theresa Williams | 53 | 10154787151884729_10154787222724729 | I would say "no better for him", and he should have known better, etc., but by now anyone who gets involved with Trump should know better.  And if we are not careful this joker will be running our country like the con artist he is.
3 | Killian Walsh | 15 | 10154787151884729_10154787298854729 | And that folks is how he'll run the country, in and out of constant lawsuits and litigation. Oops can't go to a world event, got to go to court.

5 | Tracy Allen | 3 | 10154787151884729_10154787495089729 | Grist for the short attention span crowd.  Have you all forgotten that Hillary had >$8M in unpaid bills after her 2008 run and had to go hat in hand to President-elect Obama to bail her out before she ran afoul of Federal ethics rules (there's irony for you)?  Interestingly, as late as May 2013, Salon reported that Bill Clinton still had not retired all his campaign debt from the 1996 election.
6 | Anna Callahan | 9 | 10154787151884729_10154787348374729 | Donald J. Trump the lying crook who talked over the weekend at his rally's about a 'contract' he has with the American people is a joke. He is not capable of honoring a contract because Trump doesn't pay his bills or the contractors who have worked on his construction projects and casinos. He hasn't paid federal taxes in over TWO decades and still doesn't pay like the rest of the hardworking Americans pay taxes. Trump, show us your tax returns!
7 | Rafiki Kester Brown | 0 | 10154787151884729_10154789252114729 | Can Nigerians see here now that campaigns cost Money! There's a party who came to power giving us the impression that their opponent stole money to campaign yet not revealing the source of their own campaign funds. This party barely existed 2years to its victory. The world wants to know the magic they performed.
8 | Rhonda Elam Benedict | 1 | 10154787151884729_10154787688639729 | That's his reputation. He has no problem putting small businesses out of business and not paying his bills. That's why he has loans from foreign countries. No banks would loan him money here. Embarrassment for the USA.
9 | George Adams | 0 | 10154787151884729_10154788240794729 | STOP Election Fraud: Do NOT use Soros voting machines. Please vote to put Billery/Killery on trial for TREASON. She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleeding the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovreinity of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump.

11 | Henrik Ahlm | 4 | 10154787151884729_10154787363649729 | Why vote Clinton and not Trump?It is one of the most simple questions to answer if you got a normal functioning brain.Like the editorial board of one of the world's most respected business newspapers said today:"Mrs Clinton carries enough baggage to fill a Boeing 747. She is not trusted by the majority of voters. But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US.

16 | Danny Babcock | 1 | 10154787151884729_10154790219914729 | “Trump is really not qualified.”  -- Just look back at his daily temper tantrums over the course of his campaign!!! He brings the Tasmanian-Devil to mind… he acts and talks just like the cartoon character. Hillary Clinton isn’t perfect, but after the three debates, it’s very clear Trump doesn’t have the intelligence, or temperament to be President. Now add Trump’s daily ranting and tweeting about everyone and thing, that’s “out to get him”, it's the Media, it’s the Clintons, it’s the Establishment, it's rigged polls, his shorts are too tight, it’s those women or/and it’s the corrupt system that's doing it to little Donald Trump. “That person in your mind’s eye – is - Donald Trump!” Does that imagine look like someone who should be President of the United States?  --- I sure don’t think so!

The only remedy The Hatch Act allows is the immediate removal of Director Comey from his position. NOW.

3 | Sharon Lietaert | 3 | 10154786686014729_10154786785689729 | A newly released email from WikiLeaks is just the latest evidence of the cozy relationship between the Clinton campaign and CNN.The February 2015 email entitled "Heads up - between us" shows that CNN sources leaked the results of polls to the Clinton campaign prior to publishing them. The results were leaked initially to Joel Benenson, a pollster and the Chief Strategist to Clinton campaign. They were then forwarded to chairman John Podesta, campaign manager Robby Mook, and Clinton aid Huma Abedin amongst others."I think you are going to enjoy a poll we have releasing tomorrow morning at 6:00 am ET that asks about 2016ers and whether they are perceived as candidates of the past or candidates of the future," the email from a "source" at CNN reads. "Some interesting findings..."This isn't the first time CNN's journalistic integrity has been called into question by a leaked email. Earlier this month it was revealed that interim chairperson of the DNC Donna Brazile had leaked a debate question to the Clinton campaign.
4 | Annabelle Collins | 6 | 10154786686014729_10154786936669729 | Republicans have been convinced since the 1990s that the Clintons are criminals. They have spent 25 years and millions of dollars from the public treasury investigating the couple. And they now point to the 25 years of investigation as evidence that the Clintons must be engaged in some sort of criminal activity. Perhaps they are, but the GOP hasn't had much luck uncovering it.

6 | Annabelle Collins | 1 | 10154786686014729_10154789457569729 | The word "explosive" has been rendered meaningless in this US presidential election – so I'll just state this baldly. The FBI is investigating a deliberate, years-long Russian effort by which Moscow co-opted Donald Trump, and the Republican Party candidate had, until very recently, a super-secret internet server, which carried heavy, two-way traffic between his Manhattan tower and a Russian bank with close ties to the Kremlin.

My wife just got a letter from her health insurance company announcing that her rates were skyrocketing -- up more than 200% for next year. Most people would just clean their underwear and call their insurance company after the election. We called the next day and learned that the news wasn't nearly as bad. She could get slightly better coverage from her current company for just slightly more.Why would the insurance company send out the most dire letter possible unless they wanted to frighten people and maybe get them to vote against Hillary? (Not that she actually DESERVES anyone's vote, but I hate unfairness! Insurance companies HATE Obamacare and are probably mostly Republican.)

The memo, which has been provided to the FBI, claims Russian intelligence had “compromised” Mr Trump during his visits to Moscow and could “blackmail him.”The former Western intelligence officer reportedly spent almost 20 years working on Russian intelligence matters and now works for a US firm gathering information on Russia for corporate clients.He was asked to research Mr Trump’s dealings in Russia in June.What he found was so serious he gave a copy of his report to the FBI without the permission of his employer.According to his sources, he said, “there was an established exchange of information between the Mr Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.”Mother Jones has reviewed the report and other memos the former spy wrote.The first memo, based on his conversations with Russian sources, noted, “Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.”It maintained that Mr Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.”It memo claimed Russian intelligence had “compromised” Mr Trump during his visits to Moscow and could “blackmail him.”Intelligence had also created a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on “bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.”The former spy said the response from the FBI was “shock and horror.”
12 | Henrik Ahlm | 2 | 10154786686014729_10154786987789729 | Why vote Clinton and not Trump?It is one of the most simple questions to answer if you got a normal functioning brain.Like the editorial board of one of the world's most respected business newspapers said today:"Mrs Clinton carries enough baggage to fill a Boeing 747. She is not trusted by the majority of voters. But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US.

Worse president since Jimmy Carter.Doubled the deficit, absolutely killed manufacturing ( see graph ), and letISIS and Russia overrun the Middle East among a long list of very poorpolicies. Do you realize that we would be a third world economy, if not forthe dollar's status as a world currency ?Seriously ! Our GDP to deficit isworse than Greece's !

Michelle Obama may have a bright future in politics.

Trump is for Law and Order and as he says Hillary should be in jail. Hillary is the one who "KNOWS" Putin, sold our uranium to Putin so Putin could in turn sell part to Iran, so they can make a bomb to kill us/our children/our grandchildren. Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of America. I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself. Hillary threatened Bill women who he molested/raped/attempted to molest on National TV, sent private detectives to dig up dirt on them and had them ALL audited by the IRS. Hillary stands for open borders, for a One World Government but Trump stands for America and Americans.

Now, they are so efficient that it cost them a total of $84,684,494 in expenses (Line 18) to give away $8,865,052 to charity!!!!Including $29,914,108 in salaries (Line 15), $185,970 in fundraising fees (Line 16a, that’s actually legitimate), and a WHOPPING $45,719,364 (Line 17) in “other expenses”!!!!!So AFTER all that hard charitable work they end the year with $247,299,458 (Line 22), a cool $100,000,000 more than was contributed for The year!!! Folks, no matter how you slice and dice it, this is simply a blatant money laundering program. They don’t even try to hide it!!! Oh and Congress wanted to investigate the Clinton Foundation and the DOJ stepped in and blocked it!

More than 18 million votes have already been cast, and in a best-case scenario for Trump, he gets to 266 in the Electoral College.Where does he get the other four?

Why not act LIKE A JOURNALIST, and say, we don't have all the facts, the letter is so vague it seems to be causing more confusion and skewing of facts. We haven't heard from any reliable sources as to whose emails they actually are, whose device it was, etc. It is obvious that you are becoming angered at anyone speaking to the, let's wait and see instead of jumping to conclusions based on a letter of non evidence of anything, besides the fact Comey got his feeling hurt by coworkers not speaking to him and his admissions he spoke to his wife Katherine about ongoing FBI classified investigations.
6 | Malcolm Mandel | 0 | 10154786033429729_10154789827494729 | Trump’s appeal.It’s not all about himSamuel Ktheblacksilentmajority   SMDonald Trump loves to strut around like an egotistical fool thinking it’s all about him. But, his appeal is not really about him. It’s about racism, sexism, anti-semitism, and every intolerant “ism” you can imagine. The people who live to hate would support any candidate or any party that promotes division and hatred. These are the same people who waged a war against the nation’s first African American president, Barack Obama. They are now ready to block the first female president.The divisions Trump’s supporters foolishly seek would weaken this country from within and could only benefit the likes of a Putin, Iran or ISIS. But bigotry and common sense often cancel each other out.Indeed, Trump’s appeal isn’t about his qualifications, his shady deals, his tax dodging, his insulting veterans, his treatment of women and people of color. His supporters couldn’t care less about those issues. They care about their hate, and Trump is popular with them because he has become the flagbearer of hatred in this country. Fortunately, this country has far more good people than bad.All decent Americans should get out and vote, not just against Trump, but against all the Republican senators and representatives who endorsed him.Lyrics from the movie South Pacific about hate.written by Rodgers and Hammerstein.“You've got to be taughtTo hate and fear,You've got to be taughtFrom year to year,It's got to be drummedIn your dear little earYou've got to be carefully taught.You've got to be taught to be afraidOf people whose eyes are oddly made,And people whose skin is a diff'rent shade,You've got to be carefully taught.You've got to be taught before it's too late,Before you are six or seven or eight,To hate all the people your relatives hate,You've got to be carefully taught!”

The Director “should have” shared that even after the FBI reviews the Anthony Weiner computer emails, there is little chance any charges will be filed against Clinton and  “Careless but not Criminal ”, included in the FBI's original case evaluation will stand. Several legal experts have since shared that in fact that there is little chance any new charges will result from the review. The FBI determined that even careless handling of classified information did not make Clinton guilty of a crime. FBI hasn’t reviewed them yet; but the FBI shared that some, if not all, will be likely be copies of emails they already have.

She is not trusted by the majority of voters. But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US. Period!Nobody, who loves America, wants a President, who secretly enjoys a sexsual relationship with Putin. Putin - the serious rumour says - makes Trump crawl on the floor while Putin whips Trumps hairdue with a goosefeather all the while Trump beggs for mercy and cries out loud. The rumour also has it that a certain gay speculator from Silicon Valley likes to join in.And U.S. gun owners - men in black are back on Election day!

According to reports, at least 6 members of Congress and several leaders from federal agencies are implicated in the pedophile ring, which they say was run directly with the Clinton Foundation as a front. According to an NYPD source, emails found on Anthony Weiner’s laptop detail trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary Clinton on convicted pedophile pal billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s plane ‘Lolitta express‘ to a place known as “Sex Slave Island“.

A vote for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka and the Green Party is a vote for a viable multi-party democracy going forward."Just 5 percent of the national vote for the Green Party Stein/Baraka ticket can be a true game-changer for American politics. It will qualify the Green Party for recognition as an official national party, and for federal funding in the 2020 presidential race proportional to the amount of votes received — at least $8 million to $10 million. It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state). It means the party can leap over the undemocratic barriers to ballot access for independent parties in many states, and help us lay the groundwork for a truly competitive challenge to the two-party system and the corporate rule it perpetuates."Third Party Presidential Forum:One week before what’s shaping up to be an historic presidential election, Tavis Smiley on PBS will host a presidential forum featuring the third party candidates, Jill Stein of the Green Party and Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party.This forum will be taped live Monday, October 31, 2016, in the show’s Los Angeles studio and air on Tavis Smiley over two nights next week on Mondayevening and Tuesday, November 1 on PBS.

A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!

A vote for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka and the Green Party is a vote for a viable multi-party democracy going forward."Just 5 percent of the national vote for the Green Party Stein/Baraka ticket can be a true game-changer for American politics. It will qualify the Green Party for recognition as an official national party, and for federal funding in the 2020 presidential race proportional to the amount of votes received — at least $8 million to $10 million. It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state). It means the party can leap over the undemocratic barriers to ballot access for independent parties in many states, and help us lay the groundwork for a truly competitive challenge to the two-party system and the corporate rule it perpetuates."Third Party Presidential Forum:One week before what’s shaping up to be an historic presidential election, Tavis Smiley on PBS will host a presidential forum featuring the third party candidates, Jill Stein of the Green Party and Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party.This forum will be taped live Monday, October 31, 2016, in the show’s Los Angeles studio and air on Tavis Smiley over two nights next week on Mondayevening and Tuesday, November 1 on PBS.

Trump is coming unglued! The man is insane. He brings the Tasmanian-Devil to mind, he acts and talks just like the cartoon character. Clinton isn’t perfect, but after the three debates, it’s very clear Trump doesn’t have the intelligence, or temperament to be President. Now add that Trump knows he's in trouble, so it's the Media, it’s the Clintons, it’s the Establishment, it's rigged polls, his shorts are too tight, it’s those women, it’s the rigged and corrupt system that's doing it to little Donny Trump. If the Democrats could rig elections why are the House and Senate in Republican control? If elections could be rigged, the GOP sure as hell wouldn’t have Trump as their nominee.

It would turn us backwards 30 yearsTRUMP AND HIS TOP ADVISORS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI FOR HIS TIES TO RUSSIA AND PUTIN!LETTER FROM HARRY REID TO FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY:Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) says that FBI director James Comey is sitting on “explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.”Comey isn’t telling the American public what he knows about Trump and the Russians, Reid says. But, he says, Comey seems eager to dish dirt on Hillary Clinton.In the course of investigating Anthony Weiner for sexual misconduct, the FBI gained access to a computer that had also been used by Weiner’s estranged wife, senior Hillary Clinton advisor Huma Abedin. The computer contained emails that may have been relevant to the FBI’s earlier investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private email server.When Comey found out about the computer, Reid points out, he notified Congress immediately — if vaguely — that the FBI had come across this new evidence. In Reid’s view, that presented a strong and troubling contrast to the FBI’s silence over Trump’s supposed Kremlin ties.“The double standard established by your actions is clear,” Reid writes.This letter is serious business. Reid writes that “my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act” — the law that prohibits most federal employees from engaging in partisan political activity.“Through your partisan actions,” he tells Comey, “you may have broken the law.”The Hatch Act is what prevents members of the US military from attending political rallies in uniform, or government workers from wearing campaign pins to work. In other words, it applies to activity that’s a lot less significant than what Reid is accusing Comey and the FBI of: selectively telling the public about information that could be damaging to one candidate, while not telling it about information that could be (much more) damaging to her opponent.“The clear double standard established by your actions,” Reid concludes, “strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group.Will be updated regularlyIF YOU CARE, SHARE!#HillYes #Hillary45 #ImWithHer #Hillary2016 #BlueLandslide #StrongerTogether #ClintonKaine2016 #HillaryClinton2016 #VoteBlueUpAndDownTheBallot

Trump is for Law and Order and as he says Hillary should be in jail. Hillary is the one who "KNOWS" Putin, sold our uranium to Putin so Putin could in turn sell part to Iran, so they can make a bomb to kill us/our children/our grandchildren. Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of America. I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself. Hillary threatened Bill women who he molested/raped/attempted to molest on National TV, sent private detectives to dig up dirt on them and had them ALL audited by the IRS. Hillary stands for open borders, for a One World Government but Trump stands for America and Americans.

1 | Carolyn Peterson | 17 | 10154782528699729_10154782761899729 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks.
2 | Charlie Stone | 7 | 10154782528699729_10154782786769729 | I'll just leave this here...."Clinton’s email habits look positively transparent when compared with the subpoena-dodging, email-hiding, private-server-using George W. Bush administration. Between 2003 and 2009, the Bush White House “lost” 22 million emails. This correspondence included millions of emails written during the darkest period in America’s recent history, when the Bush administration was ginning up support for what turned out to be a disastrous war in Iraq with false claims that the country possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and, later, when it was firing U.S. attorneys for political reasons."

Watergate, covered by excellent fair and balanced reporting by the main stream media, destroyed Nixon at a time the Law and Order prevailed in America. Watergate was very minor compared to what is happening now with the emails and practices which Rudy Giulianni, an ex-prosecuting attorney, said clearly are fall under RICO charges and should be brought in front of a Grand Jury. http://freebeacon.com/politics/clinton-aides-memo-details-ties-consulting-firm-clinton-foundation/?utm_source=Freedom+Mail&utm_campaign=bab3aef7f6-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_10_28&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b5e6e0e9ea-bab3aef7f6-46059981

I've heard people say Comey is a straight shooter but that's what they said about Petraeus and look how that turned out. I'm voting for Clinton.

Do you know the Government handouts that Trump has so far collected from GOVERNMENT, all by himself, by his own admission, is so much bigger than the handouts that millions of supposed single moms of America has collected as “Gov. Handouts”? No wonder, they call you “Rednecks” & “deplorables”.Corporate America is collecting more Government Handouts than all people on welfare list (X 10).

And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that’s where we are…Is it a certainty that we won’t learn before the election? I’m not sure it’s a certainty we won’t learn before the election.IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT BERNSTEIN  IS A HILLARY SUPPORTER BUT EVEN HE KNOWS THIS IS HUGE. HE CALLED INTO CNN TO OFFER HIS ANALYSIS ❗️These are Carl Bernstein's opinions and not mine.

Trump is for Law and Order and as he says Hillary should be in jail. Hillary is the one who "KNOWS" Putin, sold our uranium to Putin so Putin could in turn sell part to Iran, so they can make a bomb to kill us/our children/our grandchildren. Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of America. I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself. Hillary threatened Bill women who he molested/raped/attempted to molest on National TV, sent private detectives to dig up dirt on them and had them ALL audited by the IRS. And you want to call me delusional, I do believe I have proven here WITH FACTS who is delusional. Now try to have a nice day!!!!!

This is their “Form 990” required by the IRS for all charities. In 2013 they had total revenue of $148,889,439 (Line 12). Their TOTAL Grants to Charity were $8,865,052 (Line 13). That is a measly 5.95%!!!!! Now, they are so efficient that it cost them a total of $84,684,494 in expenses (Line 18) to give away $8,865,052 to charity!!!!Including $29,914,108 in salaries (Line 15), $185,970 in fundraising fees (Line 16a, that’s actually legitimate), and a WHOPPING $45,719,364 (Line 17) in “other expenses”!!!!!So AFTER all that hard charitable work they end the year with $247,299,458 (Line 22), a cool $100,000,000 more than was contributed for The year!!! Folks, no matter how you slice and dice it, this is simply a blatant money laundering program. They don’t even try to hide it!!! Oh and Congress wanted to investigate the Clinton Foundation and the DOJ stepped in and blocked it!
