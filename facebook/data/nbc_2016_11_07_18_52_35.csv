Marijuana regulation, gun rights and the death penalty are all ballot initiatives before voters in multiple states on Election Day.

2 | Mario Vitulli | 2 | 1561209913899033_1561213780565313 | Well! Bernie Sanders supporters, looks like you've been taken for a ride by the Democratic Party and the Clinton machine!!!! So, come election day make sure you do like good little puppies on a leash and do what's expected of you! Oh yeah , don't forget to wipe your bum!!!!
3 | Steph Judice | 0 | 1561209913899033_1561222287231129 | DO NOT LISTEN TO THE POLLS !! If hillary were so far ahead, why would she be frantically going to all of the states that she allegedly has locked in. Look at the Trump rallys. They are not just getting a few thousand, they are getting thousands and thousands, people standing in line for hours to see him, mile long lines of people trying to get into Trump rallys. The polls are being used to deceive you... Like Rush said, If you do not trust the news media for your news, why would you trust their polls... GO VOTE!
4 | Jim Connole | 0 | 1561209913899033_1561216207231737 | Hillary and Jeb Bush support the Federal ban on cannabis. Chelsea said people in Colorado are dying from cannabis.DEA can still raid states at any time. Obama made an agreement with DEA but nothing can really stop them until it's taken out of schedule I.
5 | Juan Pablo Villacis | 6 | 1561209913899033_1561210823898942 | As American hispanics, we are tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would vote for a third Obama term with crooked Hillary Clinton. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the fantastic Trump Strong t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/trumpstrong . And let's Make America Great Again! Thank you.

What is disturbing is that we live in a country where even one single person, never mind millions, believe a brainless, racist, egomaniacal sexual predator with the temperament of a middle school bully deserves your precious vote. We're at a point where if you vote for Trump you either endorse what he represents (I almost said "stands for" but he stands for NOTHING other than his insatiable narcissism) or you are ignorant of it. Which is it? I really want a Trump voter to tell me.

10 | Mike Rashid | 1 | 1561209913899033_1561210010565690 | HARDCORE DEMOCRATS don't care that Hillary Clinton flip flops her views as needed to get votes. They don't care that she has lied repeatedly for years. They don't care that she helped create a health care system that is about to fail, leaving millions by the wayside. They don't care that she was instrumental in the very creation of a morphed Al Qaeda, now called ISIS. They don't care that millions of people have either died or have been displaced by her instrumentation of such. They don't care that her Clinton Foundation has taken hundreds of millions of dollars from countries that kill gays and stone women. They don't care that she has committed treasonous acts via her foundation by doing favors for enemy nations. They don't care that she and her husband have created an enterprise whereby all the mainstream media, including the New York Times, CNN, NBC, ABC, Comcast, can donate. They don't care that she has been so incredibly successful at wielding money and power from the world's largest companies, here and abroad, that she rules over the entire Obama administration, including President Obama, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and FBI director James Comey. They don't care that she believes killing a baby hours before its natural birth trumps the babies shot at life. They don't care that she has never done anything to improve the plight of Blacks or Hispanics who may be caught in a inter-generational web of dependency, poverty, and unemployment. They don't care that she has done nothing about the bad schools, drugs, and crime in the ghetto. They don't care that she is indifferent to the millions of immigrants who come to our shores legally, and spend large amounts of time and money in order to become U.S. citizens, while others cut in line. They don't care that she has done nothing to stop drugs from infiltrating our towns and cities. They don't care that she blatantly cheated by being given primary debate questions in advance. They don't care to think about why her answers during the debates seemed so well rehearsed, almost memorized. They don't care that her organization worked to plant violent operatives in Trump rallies. They don't care about how women were paid off to claim harassment by Trump. You know what? The problem is not that hardcore democrats don't care that Hillary Clinton is a liar, a cheat, and a thief. The problem is that they are willing to support a morally bankrupt candidate.

16 | Rick Brown | 0 | 1561209913899033_1561211957232162 | Democrats have launched a legal blitz of their own in an attempt to shut down Trump's poll-watching efforts in Pennsylvania and three other battleground states, arguing in lawsuits that Republican monitoring efforts amount to 'vigilante voter intimidation' that violates federal law. Assange earlier denied he was a stooge for the Russian intelligence services, claiming they were not behind the damaging leaks to the Clinton campaign. He has been wanted by Swedish authorities since 2010 over rape allegations. He has been hiding the the Ecuadorian embassy in London over fears he will be extradited to the United States. He said: 'The Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything.'Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That's false – we can say that the Russian government is not the source.'The first tranche of emails published by WikiLeaks claimed the Democratic party leadership actively favored Clinton over her rival for the nomination Bernie Sanders.  The Department of Homeland Security Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said last month they were 'confident' the Russian government was responsible for the leaks.But Russia has denied this and presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov said it was 'nonsense'.In an interview with veteran John Pilger on RT, Assange said: 'We have independently authenticated the emails. WikiLeaks has a decade-long, perfect record in the accurate authentication of leaked documents.'

We have the RIGHT & RESPONSIBILITY to impeach any official of the executive or judicial branch of our government. We need to start a petition calling for the impeachment of any government official recieving funds from ANY major corporations. Then we need to make it illegal for any future political officials to accept any kind of money from anyone accept their paycheck. If they do they should immediately impeached with no severance pay. It should be illegal to engage in any form of bullying during campaigning. The issues of the country and world need to be discussed, not swept under a rug while the candidates spend an hour calling each other names. There should be term limits with equal amounts of officials from each political party in the country being represented. There needs to be laws for more transparency in the government. We the people have the RIGHT to know what our government is doing!!!To our military and police, when the revolution begins you need to lay down your weapons and join us! It is your responsibility as an American citizen to fight corruption and injustice. Do your duty.

6 | Terry Hite | 6 | 1561101667243191_1561147827238575 | NBC, you are so Biased with your Posts... Stop trying to influence the election and allow the public to make their own decision. Compare this post to the one you did on Clinton. That says a lot on how biased the media is.
7 | Sam Adams | 5 | 1561101667243191_1561147743905250 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!

12 | Kristian Keefer | 0 | 1561101667243191_1561148617238496 | I'm receiving many reports that Trump's campaign is making a last ditch and possibly illegal attempt to change the election-making calls to likely Clinton/Democratic supporters telling them that someone already voted using their ID and they (or the people) will be arrested.  No such thing has occurred.  Also reports of Trump supporters who are planning to have their guns visible at voting stations in Ohio to try to intimidate supporters.

Look, I live outside the US so whoever is president would affect me very little. My perspective has always been opinion of better policy. I have no reason to choose a candidate based on fear and I wouldn't vote using my bible. Honestly, if I used my Bible to vote... Neither Trump or Hillary would be the choice. They both have a lot of negative attributes, cannot be denied... but which one has been there for 30yrs now milking the system but putting very little back into it? I respect your choices, Ive had my fun Hillary bashing... time to get serious now. #VoteTrump . Be safe at the polls, its a place to vote, not a place to fight.

25 | Sylvia Scheller | 1 | 1561101667243191_1561193270567364 | Hillary Clinton will be fatal to the United states of America. Why would I say that, you ask? First, morally she is bankrupt. During the course of her marriage, her husband is purported to have had affairs with 17 different women. Why does this matter to you? Because Hillary Clinton has chosen not to face the issue of her husbands immorality and lack of faithfulness in order to facilitate her own political ambition. Hillary Clinton has even chosen to attack and attempt to ruin her husbands sexual partners rather than face the greater issue of his unfaithfulness. Can we afford to have a woman as president who has so little respect for herself that she won't face such horrific philandering by her own husband? How can you ever expect her to stand up to our enemies if she won't stand up for herself? Next is the issue of un-American behavior and judgement. As Senator she never accomplished a single piece legislation and cost her constituency half a million jobs. As first lady she was so out of touch with what was happening, her husband was having an affair with an intern right under her nose and she refused to get involved. When she left the white house she said she was broke and attempted to relieve the American people of many of the furnishings of the white house. She was made to return over $200 thousand worth of goods to the people of the USA. As Secretary of State she spent more time selling her office than she did doing the work of the country. She managed to misplace $6 Billion that was never accounted for and never found. She sold influence and favors for personal wealth. Hillary Clinton started a foundation and sold favors and government contracts to foreign countries and wealthy foreigners for contributions to her foundation. Only .06 cents of every dollar has found it's way to charity while 94 cents finds it's way to the Clinton pockets. After being broke upon leaving the white house, Clinton is now worth over $400 Million. Hillary Clinton's dishonesty is classic. Her constant lies and dishonest behavior are her trademark. Hillary is willing to trade American lives for personal gain while lying the whole time and attempting to convince the American public she was engaged elsewhere. Hillary has sold America's uranium reserves to Russia and peddled the American Government for a personal fortune. Worst of all, Hillary Clinton has joined forces with George Soros, an ex-NAZI Billionaire, who backs Black Lives Matter and the riots in Ferguson and Baltimore with his own money. Soros has contributed to Hillary Clinton's campaign to the tune of $30 Million of his personal money. That means he will own as much of a Hillary presidency as he has owed of Obama. Between Socialist money an donations from Islamic countries, Hillary Clinton would just be a front for everyone else who owns a piece of our Presidential Office. ow the collusion within the Executive Branch of our government has resulted n special treatment for Hilary Clinton, not only once, but twice. Obviously the corruption in our government reaches all the way to the top. President Obama has apparently ordered his Justice Department to control the FBI so Hillary Clinton walks away from prosecution that has put others in prison.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kathie Routman Dior | 82 | 1561031613916863_1561106490576042 | HARD CORE DEMOCRATS don't care that Hillary Clinton flip flops her views as needed to get votes. They don't care that she has lied repeatedly for years. They don't care that she helped create a health care system that is about to fail, leaving millions by the wayside. They don't care that she was instrumental in the very creation of a morphed Al Qaeda, now called ISIS. They don't care that millions of people have either died or have been displaced by her instrumentation of such. They don't care that her Clinton Foundation has taken hundreds of millions of dollars from countries that kill gays and stone women. They don't care that she has committed treasonous acts via her foundation by doing favors for enemy nations. They don't care that she and her husband have created an enterprise whereby all the mainstream media, including the New York Times, CNN, NBC, ABC, Comcast, can donate. They don't care that she has been so incredibly successful at wielding money and power from the world's largest companies, here and abroad, that she rules over the entire Obama administration, including President Obama, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and FBI director James Comey. They don't care that she believes killing a baby hours before its natural birth trumps a mother's choice to have the baby slaughtered. They don't care that she has never done anything to improve the plight of Blacks or Hispanics who may be caught in a inter-generational web of dependency, poverty, and unemployment. They don't care that she has done nothing about the bad schools, drugs, and crime in the ghetto. They don't care that she is indifferent to the millions of immigrants who come to our shores legally, and spend large amounts of time and money in order to become U.S. citizens, while others cut in line. They don't care that she has done nothing to stop drugs from infiltrating our towns and cities. They don't care that she blatantly cheated by being given primary debate questions in advance. They don't care to think about why her answers during the debates seemed so well rehearsed, almost memorized. They don't care that her organization worked to plant violent operatives in Trump rallies. They don't care about how women were paid off to claim harassment by Trump. You know what? The problem is not that hard core democrats don't care that Hillary Clinton is a liar, a cheat, and a thief. The problem is that they are willing to support a morally bankrupt candidate.
2 | Esther Moore | 27 | 1561031613916863_1561111370575554 | I was asked how I could ever support Trump, after the comments he made over 11 yrs ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this......If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 yrs of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion,(even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would note vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 11yrs ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the State of our poor country right now...Rant over... I'm still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste from a Fellow Deplorable....

5 | Jeannie Rucker Kerns | 7 | 1561031613916863_1561119373908087 | What kind of people are Democrats?  They have a governor who gave 60,000 felons the right to vote so he could swing election, Hillary was given the questions to the debate before it took place, Steve Harvey pretends to do a interview with Hillary when he knew his staff gave her the questions beforehand.
6 | Tim Banes | 7 | 1561031613916863_1561115670575124 | Albert Einstein is broadly credited with exclaiming “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results”. And this is exactly what you get. SAME results with Hillary as you received with Obama. But let me guess, You have done ZERO research?..Here, Let me educate you. Innocent Republican men and women are being attacked by goons, paid to incite violence on Hillary's dime. Is this the America you want your children grow up in? The dishonest media is guilty. Journalistic integrity is nonexistent and propaganda is the norm. You can’t have government corruption, without media corruption. We have both. We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system? You seem to gloss over all FACTS of today's society as a whole, And focus squarely on your dislike of Mr.Trump. Hillary will ONLY CONTINUE and ENHANCE what I have stated above. This again is FACT. Perhaps you should vote from a Adult standpoint for your country. Not from personal, emotional viewpoint of sour grapes against Mr. Trump.

8 | Lillysioux Maloney | 3 | 1561031613916863_1561110710575620 | Here's my full statement on Hillary Clinton in light of the FBI's announcement today:Regardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI's investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation's secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security. She simply believes she's above the law and always plays by her own rules. This is a pattern with the Clintons, and the American people should not have to endure four more years of their scandal and baggage. Fortunately, the American people have the opportunity to ensure Secretary Clinton never gets her hands on classified information again. Let's bring the Clinton era to an end by voting for Donald J. Trump on Tuesday.

12 | Lillysioux Maloney | 1 | 1561031613916863_1561110523908972 | MBA, CEO, small business owner. Since you asked. And....This is why I'm voting for Trump. 1. He is the only candidate who wants to strengthen the millitary. 2. He is the only candidate with a plan (and an extremely good one, I'll post it at the end.) to greatly reduce  or eliminate our country's  $21 trillion debt. 3. He is the only candidate who wants to reduce and has a plan to reduce the number of illegal immigrants coming into our country and driving up our debt .(It's ok to give to charities, but it's not ok for those charities to just steal your money). 4.He is not a politician. He is a businessman the (The best). 5. He is the only candidate to recognize ISIS and radical islam as a threat, despite their actions all over the world ( at least three incidents of mass  killing in the US alone. Many more in France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and lots more, sadly there have been so many I can't even remember them all.  6. I want to keep my guns!Here's Trumps financial plan.....Ok, . Let me explain how Trump's plan will make America a Financial Giant. 1) Putting tariffs  (taxes) on imported goods will make foreign products more expensive on our sheves. However, that will make it so we a.) buy American products, which will in turn create jobs and put Americans back in the workforce instead of welfare line. Which will in turn lower our countries expenses and raise its gross Sales  (GNP). b.) Because many American companies produce their product outside the US, they will have to pay a tax to bring it into America. In the long run it will be cheaper to produce the product in America. Which means those companies will start paying American income tax instead of to foreign countries, and will also employ Americans who pay taxes here as opposed to foreign countries. ...2) devaluing our currency in relation to other countries,  will make our products cheaper on their shelves and we will sale much more products abroad, which will again put more Americans back to work. 3) Cutting business taxes will make it financially beneficial to have headquarters in America vs. any foreign country. Which means we will get something from global companies as opposed to nothing. (Because they choose to put their headquarters and the bulk of their taxed money in places that will tax them less).
13 | Steve Thames | 2 | 1561031613916863_1561112363908788 | Again the Hillary Hitler Regime has control of the media by twisting the real crime of paying the protesters to instigate hate and violence. Trump supporters don't go to the Hillary rallies and do these despicable things. Trump supporters are jumped, bullied, egged, cars damaged and denied their right to assemble. The Hillary Hitler Youth is firebombing Trump Election headquarters and vandalizing homes with Trump signs. Now you tell me who the fear-mongers are? Hillary is evil and promotes evil. She has prayed on the weak minded and ignorant to create this evil empire. Despite the Hillary Hitler campaign the Trump supporters are still getting the word out and showing up to rallies in Thousands. VOTE JOBS! VOTE TRUMP!

Hillary is willing to trade American lives for personal gain while lying the whole time and attempting to convince the American public she was engaged elsewhere. Hillary has sold America's uranium reserves to Russia and peddled the American Government for a personal fortune. Worst of all, Hillary Clinton has joined forces with George Soros, an ex-NAZI Billionaire, who backs Black Lives Matter and the riots in Ferguson and Baltimore with his own money. Soros has contributed to Hillary Clinton's campaign to the tune of $30 Million of his personal money. That means he will own as much of a Hillary presidency as he has owed of Obama. Between Socialist money an donations from Islamic countries, Hillary Clinton would just be a front for everyone else who owns a piece of our Presidential Office. ow the collusion within the Executive Branch of our government has resulted n special treatment for Hilary Clinton, not only once, but twice. Obviously the corruption in our government reaches all the way to the top. President Obama has apparently ordered his Justice Department to control the FBI so Hillary Clinton walks away from prosecution that has put others in prison.
16 | Bill Roudabush | 0 | 1561031613916863_1561206677232690 | Clinton talks about bringing the country together and the economy and creating jobs something her and Obama know nothing about. If you listen to Clinton Obama hasn't accomplished anything in the last 8 years and that dummy is out there campaigning for her lmfao. If you want 4 years of Clinton after 8 years of Obama you are a special kind of stupid.
17 | Taylor Ludwig | 0 | 1561031613916863_1561123233907701 | My question is simple....why is it that our Justice Department and the FBI, after all the sheer evedice they have been given and found out, refuse to charge Hillary Clinton with treason or look further into the corrupt actions taken place by the Clinton foundation?? As a citizen of this great country it worries me that the law and order of our land is tainted.
18 | Stephanie Bradbury | 1 | 1561031613916863_1561115937241764 | I YouTube searched "good things about Hillary" and I didn't see any videos... I was hoping to see an inspirational video that I just haven't seen before, and there wasn't anything
19 | Rick Martinez | 2 | 1561031613916863_1561112883908736 | “No tyranny finds support without tapping into our fears this is key. Hence, all tyranny is terrorist. And when this terror — which was sown in the peripheries, with the massacres, looting, oppression and injustice — explodes in centers with different forms of violence, even hateful and cowardly attacks, citizens who still retain some rights are tempted to the false security of physical or social walls. Walls that enclose some and banish others. Walled citizens, terrified on one side, excluded, exiled, and still more terrified on the other. Is that the life that our Father God wants for their children?" Pope Francis
20 | Olivia Triplett Wright | 0 | 1561031613916863_1561214460565245 | Why I am voting for Donald Trump without mention Hillary. I challenge anyone supporting Hillary to do the same without mention Bill or Trump. 1. Stop the inflow of illegals coming over our boarders, putting a major strain on the cities, states and our country. We are already going broke. We can not afford to provide these people with food, shelter, schooling and medical care. 2. Stop the inflow of refugees that have not been screened. To much of a chance if ISIS or any other terrorist group to gain entry to our country. 3. Abolish and replace Obamacare. Millions of middle class families are forced to paying thousands of dollars for Obamacare and will never meet their yearly deductible, thus still having to pay out of pocket for all of their medical care. This is billions of dollars that could be spent growing our economy. 4. Trump owes nobody any favors in Washington. He is already filthy rich, so he does not have to accept donations from anybody including foreign countries in exchange for political favors. 5. He is not afraid to call anyone out if they are wrong regardless to what party they belong to. 6. Our companies are so over regulated that billions and billions of dollars are wasted trying to keep up and follow all of the executive orders that need to be over turned. 7. Bring our companies back home. We need to have it so companies can operate in this country without being over taxed. The jobs that will be created will pay more in taxes than what we will lose by lowering the cooperate tax rate putting more money to work growing our economy. 8. Renegotiate our trade agreements with other countries to make it more fair for American companies selling goods in other countries. 9. Bring law and order back to out country. Nobody is above the law regardless of who you are and who you know. 10. Secure funding for the schools and work training for the inner city communities.

Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.👁⚠If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)?

1 | Steph Heller Chepin | 16 | 1561081260578565_1561083887244969 | Don't vote for hatred =Trump or this will happen. .Trump would almost certainly face a global crisis even before he took office, as allies abroad are alarmed by his "America First" rhetoric and stated disregard for the international institutions the United States has led since World War II.
2 | Terry Wickwire | 11 | 1561081260578565_1561082520578439 | We can all learn how Donald J Dump was capable of taking the Republican Party by the force of his will. Republicans will need to do some deep soul searching to redefine their Party and reinvent themselves as representative of we the people and our lives. Republicans witnessed the horror of Sandy Hook and did nothing. Republicans witnessed mass shootings all over the nation, and politicized the proliferation of more weapons. The NRA has the Republican Party by the throat, and I use Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as my proof. He said that "any Supreme Court nominees should be approved by the NRA." We need to win the Senate and demote Mitch McConnell. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that Dump's comment "is the very definition of a racist comment." Paul Ryan supports Dump. The Republican Congress approval rating is in the toilet while President Obama has unprecedented approval ratings. Americans figured out who is responsible for the dysfunction in Washington DC and we will fix Congress. Vice Presidential candidate Tea Party Pence wants Americans to believe that Donald J Dump is capable of fixing the problems of the Tea Party obstructionists making. His history speaks volumes about his own bias against the LGBT and minority communities, and if he is the standard bearer for the future of the Republican Party then they will have learned nothing. Cuban Canadian Cruz isn't any better, Marco Rubio is a sellout, Chaffetz has more skeletons than a graveyard, Gowdy is complicit with the false accusations and conspiracy theories against Hillary Clinton, Republican Governors are hated by their constituents and the Republican Party is fractured and failing. The only good news for their Party are Republicans like Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse who put content of character ahead of Party. They have a tough road ahead.I can write a book about the history of Dump and his divisive campaign, and my Facebook timeline is a treasure trove of facts that define his character flaws and immoral behaviors. His litigious future is bleak and his brand is forever tarnished, he faces felony fraud trials, a RICO trial, 169 federal lawsuits and counting and thousands of other suits for his crooked business practices. He was hoping for Executive Privilege to erase his corrupt history. He failed. Americans are going to send a resounding message to Dump and anybody else who wants to use this division as a springboard to power. Women, minorities, educated and moral people will rebuke Dump and bemuse his supporters. You're all witnessing the day when Americans stood up against authoritarian isolationism and racial profiling on our soil. America is already great because of the goodness of most of our people. History will be so much kinder to President Obama than Republicans ever were. VOTE BLUE.
3 | Bill Yarbrough | 0 | 1561081260578565_1561137613906263 | The United States is divided into a dozen factions but there are two halves. Liberals and conservatives, people who love America and people who hate America. The conservatives are fighting to salvage and save America from liberals who burn the American flag, old glory.Liberals are determined to eliminate the 1st and 2nd amendments of our great Constitution. They are challenging the first by trying to eliminate freedom of religion and by eliminating certain words from our vocabulary. They are chipping away the second by trying to eliminate certain weapons of defence and certain ammunition.The purpose of liberals in defeating freedom of religion is their desire to promote perversions and all it's branches.Liberals reason for attacking the second amendment is to disarm citizens completely in order to complete their full agenda of elimination of the first amendment.America is not just having an election in November to place a new president. We are having an election for the saving of America from the destruction by the liberals' socialist communist newly formed government they have spent years to establish.I have heard many times, if this President is elected, we will soon be at war. I say the war has already begun, the first shot just hasn't yet been fired.As a nation, we stand at a cross road in history. We will either elect President Trump and defeat ISIS, lawlessness and terrorism or we will elect Clinton and open our borders, allow ISIS free rein and lawlessness to abound. You choose which future you want and vote accordingly.
4 | Sylvia Scheller | 0 | 1561081260578565_1561197590566932 | Hillary Clinton will be fatal to the United states of America. Why would I say that, you ask? First, morally she is bankrupt. During the course of her marriage, her husband is purported to have had affairs with 17 different women. Why does this matter to you? Because Hillary Clinton has chosen not to face the issue of her husbands immorality and lack of faithfulness in order to facilitate her own political ambition. Hillary Clinton has even chosen to attack and attempt to ruin her husbands sexual partners rather than face the greater issue of his unfaithfulness. Can we afford to have a woman as president who has so little respect for herself that she won't face such horrific philandering by her own husband? How can you ever expect her to stand up to our enemies if she won't stand up for herself? Next is the issue of un-American behavior and judgement. As Senator she never accomplished a single piece legislation and cost her constituency half a million jobs. As first lady she was so out of touch with what was happening, her husband was having an affair with an intern right under her nose and she refused to get involved. When she left the white house she said she was broke and attempted to relieve the American people of many of the furnishings of the white house. She was made to return over $200 thousand worth of goods to the people of the USA. As Secretary of State she spent more time selling her office than she did doing the work of the country. She managed to misplace $6 Billion that was never accounted for and never found. She sold influence and favors for personal wealth. Hillary Clinton started a foundation and sold favors and government contracts to foreign countries and wealthy foreigners for contributions to her foundation. Only .06 cents of every dollar has found it's way to charity while 94 cents finds it's way to the Clinton pockets. After being broke upon leaving the white house, Clinton is now worth over $400 Million. Hillary Clinton's dishonesty is classic. Her constant lies and dishonest behavior are her trademark. Hillary is willing to trade American lives for personal gain while lying the whole time and attempting to convince the American public she was engaged elsewhere.

Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. Trump did not cripple our economy.

Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans.

The Republican establishmentThe media is the Democratic Party.So Trump voters get up and VOTE or all is Lost

More importantly Hillary is still under investigation for PERJURY!!, and given her penchant for habitually lying round three will not b kind......its called karma, so don't waste Americas time by voting for her!!
2 | Denise Momo Nelson | 7 | 1561079117245446_1561114507241907 | It's going to be difficult to TRUST any of the democratic news media on this election. It should have a rule that NO voting statistics should be made public until the closing of the final voting poles.
3 | Sam Adams | 2 | 1561079117245446_1561144630572228 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!

Those states are too close to call, and the third-party vote (which draws more from Clinton than Trump) might be just enough to tip the states and the election to Trump.  Be progressive, be alternative, just don't be so reckless in those two states that you let Trump get elected President of the United States!!!!! Vote for Clinton and then fight for your values downballot.

And when this terror — which was sown in the peripheries, with the massacres, looting, oppression and injustice — explodes in centers with different forms of violence, even hateful and cowardly attacks, citizens who still retain some rights are tempted to the false security of physical or social walls. Walls that enclose some and banish others. Walled citizens, terrified on one side, excluded, exiled, and still more terrified on the other.

If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.

18 | Lillysioux Maloney | 6 | 1561079117245446_1561084533911571 | Here's my full statement on Hillary Clinton in light of the FBI's announcement today:Regardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI's investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation's secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security. She simply believes she's above the law and always plays by her own rules. This is a pattern with the Clintons, and the American people should not have to endure four more years of their scandal and baggage. Fortunately, the American people have the opportunity to ensure Secretary Clinton never gets her hands on classified information again. Let's bring the Clinton era to an end by voting for Donald J. Trump on Tuesday.
19 | Lillysioux Maloney | 2 | 1561079117245446_1561083893911635 | Well Dale Pelletier, the fat pig your referring to most certainly is Hillary, living high on the hog at Americans expense. The slobs, dogs. And disgusting animals covers all the corrupt politicians. Love the name Colin Powell gave good ole Bill....boffing bimbo's bill, and lastly apparently the AG looked great on her knees while looking the other way!!

21 | Lillysioux Maloney | 2 | 1561079117245446_1561084213911603 | MBA, CEO, small business owner. Since you asked. And....This is why I'm voting for Trump. 1. He is the only candidate who wants to strengthen the millitary. 2. He is the only candidate with a plan (and an extremely good one, I'll post it at the end.) to greatly reduce  or eliminate our country's  $21 trillion debt. 3. He is the only candidate who wants to reduce and has a plan to reduce the number of illegal immigrants coming into our country and driving up our debt .(It's ok to give to charities, but it's not ok for those charities to just steal your money). 4.He is not a politician. He is a businessman the (The best). 5. He is the only candidate to recognize ISIS and radical islam as a threat, despite their actions all over the world ( at least three incidents of mass  killing in the US alone. Many more in France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and lots more, sadly there have been so many I can't even remember them all.  6. I want to keep my guns!Here's Trumps financial plan.....Ok, . Let me explain how Trump's plan will make America a Financial Giant. 1) Putting tariffs  (taxes) on imported goods will make foreign products more expensive on our sheves. However, that will make it so we a.) buy American products, which will in turn create jobs and put Americans back in the workforce instead of welfare line. Which will in turn lower our countries expenses and raise its gross Sales  (GNP). b.) Because many American companies produce their product outside the US, they will have to pay a tax to bring it into America. In the long run it will be cheaper to produce the product in America. Which means those companies will start paying American income tax instead of to foreign countries, and will also employ Americans who pay taxes here as opposed to foreign countries. ...2) devaluing our currency in relation to other countries,  will make our products cheaper on their shelves and we will sale much more products abroad, which will again put more Americans back to work. 3) Cutting business taxes will make it financially beneficial to have headquarters in America vs. any foreign country. Which means we will get something from global companies as opposed to nothing. (Because they choose to put their headquarters and the bulk of their taxed money in places that will tax them less).

It was to good not to pass on ,         POINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary? She has left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her or knew too much!
23 | Peter James Wambold | 0 | 1561079117245446_1561148167238541 | DONALD J. TRUMP CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER“Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC:• FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress;• SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health);• THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated;• FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service;• FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government;• SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. On the same day, I will begin taking the following seven actions to protect American workers:• FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 • SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership• THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator• FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately• FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.• SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward• SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure  Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law:• FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama• SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States• THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities• FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back• FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: 1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. 2. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. 3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral. 4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable. 5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. 6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. 7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. 8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. 9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values 10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics. On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. This is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people.”Please copy and paste

If Donald J. Trump wins, policy experts and political veterans see the potential for an explosive time in office.

1 | Jason Mcknight | 404 | 1561029843917040_1561032787250079 | Right... President Trump will unchange everything that President Obama changed. That is what we are hoping for. Restore dignity and trust in our government. Let's start with the FBI. Put Hillary Clinton in federal prison.
2 | Margie Jones Grundy | 226 | 1561029843917040_1561045187248839 | Trump displays most of the symptoms of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. He's conceited, boastful, pretentious, and demeaning to others, and he thinks only of himself, lacks empathy, believes he's always right, never apologizes, monopolizes conversations, feels entitled to do whatever he wants, is hyper-sensitive to anything he perceives as criticism, is easily angered, lacks self control, and acts impulsively.If short-tempered, paranoid, impulsive Donald Trump is elected president he'll have access to the nuclear codes, and if he's as trigger-happy with those codes as he is with his Twitter account, that's a bad thing.
3 | Brian Morris | 104 | 1561029843917040_1561044607248897 | If (God forbid) he does get elected, we will be at war over some minor insult and our military people will be fighting and dying over a stupid tantrum he throws.
4 | Kurt Hanke | 163 | 1561029843917040_1561034763916548 | The corruption in D.C., and amongst DNC sycophant organizations like NBC News, wold be exposed and challenged. This is why Trump is going to win.
5 | Linda Radtke | 80 | 1561029843917040_1561049670581724 | He hasn't a clue what it takes to be a President.  Obama has more class and integrity in his little finger than the orange turd could ever hope to have.
6 | Trevor Brace | 64 | 1561029843917040_1561042483915776 | "Real change also means draining the swamp of corruption in Washington.

By the machines that be that keep lying to our faces keeping her ahead at this point, I have to believe what they claim...that the fix is in and we need to stand up against this corruption and this election being stolen.
10 | Felix Salazar | 10 | 1561029843917040_1561076713912353 | Unfortunately everyone who voted for Trump will be the same ones who'll complain the loudest when he starts doing stupid stuff and their taxes go up and foreign relations change to the point that if makes us even more vulnerable than we are now . But at least he is something that Trump supporters can be proud of having their children look up to as a great role model to aspire like . Especially for their sons .. " just grab'em in the pussy son "
11 | Stephen Rosenberg | 13 | 1561029843917040_1561043650582326 | People like me would have to fight all over again for my marriage!! African Americans would have to fight all over again to drink from water fountains, Latinos would all have their drivers license checked every day, Muslims would all be accused of terrorism, women would be forced to submit to their husbands again and never take birth control and probably never work!!

13 | Santiago Vitagliano | 11 | 1561029843917040_1561077417245616 | You must be a naive moron to believe Trump who has proven himself to have no integrity whatsoever will keep his word on any of his positions! Come one you have to truly believe everyone is an idiotic no thinking robot not to realize this. Hillary is no saint but at least is manageable
14 | Emma Smith | 7 | 1561029843917040_1561065887246769 | Trump talks about no jobs, ask the GOP why they never put forth Obama's Jobs Bill. If they had worked with Obama, we would be so far ahead. But Obama did a great job by himself.  You GOP people are mentally ill.  Jason, you can go to hell.
15 | Lynn Rahn | 5 | 1561029843917040_1561110420575649 | The people that are voting for him are going to be in for a big surprise. He don't care about you only your vote. He only care about the rich. There getting the tax break not middle class. How is he going to get rid of Isis. He has no idea he hopes somebody else does.
16 | Karla K. Tomlinson | 11 | 1561029843917040_1561059113914113 | Here's what concerns me: If the most narcissistic man in the US doesn't win he won't accept it with dignity and neither will his followers. I'm praying for everyone.
17 | B Ivan Vidal | 7 | 1561029843917040_1561083097245048 | If Trump wins.... Dark days are in the Future of this great Nation, A dark era of hate, divisiveness, Despair, Chaos, and uncertainty will be upon us.
18 | Steve Reeves | 7 | 1561029843917040_1561084113911613 | I just read in the post prior to mine that says Trump will restore "Dignity & Trust" in our government. I have to wonder why someone would say that unless they are saying it satirically or are an anarchist. Nothing this man has said in the campaign would lead anyone to believe that he is remotely in touch with reality. His entire career and business is built on lies and fraud and he has swindled countless people, many of which (small business owners) might have been the voters he would be hoping to attract. He has touched a disgusting vein in the American public that has made it acceptable for the those that used to lurk in the the darkest corners of society to come out and fly their freak flag high, to openly hate on racial and religious minorities and build up on legitimize this behavior. America will need a shower after Trump is relegated to the scrap heap of history. Shame on those from the right of the political spectrum who realize they cant beat her so lets tear the country from limb to limb to weaken her has much as possible. When you chant USA! USA! to drown out the protesters or the beatings that happen at these rally's you bring shame on yourselves and your cause.
19 | Arne Johnsen | 8 | 1561029843917040_1561049167248441 | Trump will work to ensure that the American people will again feel proud, that the very poorest should be given priority, protect the country from flooding hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria who are illiterate and many radical Islamist!
20 | Thomas Patrick McAuliffe | 4 | 1561029843917040_1561076263912398 | you think a Trump win would be explosive...no kidding. there will be a lot of pissed off rock throwers...but Hillary win will be a little bumpy in the parade of lawyers trying to keep her out of jail.

25 | Elizabeth Winslow Horn | 2 | 1561029843917040_1561088647244493 | If Hillary wins.. We the people need to stop contributing to these assine campaigning.. it's rigged as evidenced by Wikileaks. We are just padding pockets of the media which has proven to be biased.... They should be paid by the Clinton's to run their agenda and it should be clear they are not objective.... perhaps they are paid. BUT we should stop funding these campaigns if it doesn't matter.. Read from several online sources not our media-- proven to be biased. SAD 😡

If Hillary Clinton is elected, here's what she would face.

You liberal imbeciles and pretend journalists and all the sheep who blindly follow you are in for a BIG negative surprise tomorrow night.  Hillary Clinton is a pathological liar, criminal, unhinged liberal, shrill demagogue and will NEVER be elected! !
2 | Taylor Ludwig | 162 | 1561010977252260_1561016477251710 | My question is simple....why is it that our Justice Department and the FBI, after all the sheer evedice they have been given and found out, refuse to charge Hillary Clinton with treason or look further into the corrupt actions taken place by the Clinton foundation?? As a citizen of this great country it worries me that the law and order of our land is tainted.
3 | Bill Dransfield | 44 | 1561010977252260_1561016687251689 | You all think the Obama had it rough. His presidency will be a cake walk compared to what the GOP will put Clinton through...
4 | Scott Mckenry | 86 | 1561010977252260_1561011667252191 | “In 2010, a massive 7.0 earthquake devastated Haiti, killing more than 200,000 people, leveling 100,000 homes, and leaving 1.5 million people destitute!” Billions of dollars were raised by the Clinton Foundation and only a few million was paid out! The Clinton’s will always take care of their rich buddies first. This is just one of Hillary’s many success stories!
5 | M Hilal Arfeen | 71 | 1561010977252260_1561011423918882 | FBI cleared hillary and all the baseless allegation on her is no more but donald trump still facing extreme bashing after exposed his character like a play boy and his popularity decreasing day by day,Trump is about to lose the election after hillary is out from all the corruption chargesDonald trump politics is finished now

Surely you Hillary supporters seen the non stop turnouts at EVERY TRUMP Rally?...Again I say to you...Same said Americans will be voting tomorrow...GET READY...WE WILL DRAIN THE SWAMP!
7 | Donald McRee | 35 | 1561010977252260_1561020003918024 | If the FBI had 150 Agents going through  the 650,000 emails in 8 days it would be like each Agent reading Gone With the Wind 9 times in 8 days. Don't think they went though 650,00 emails,Face facts Comey crumbled like most cowards.
8 | Shelle Venero | 41 | 1561010977252260_1561013350585356 | Absolutely nothing since she will be under criminal investigation and will not even be granted security clearance. Plus she is a liar, cheat, unethical and incompetent.
9 | Daniel Mallinger | 5 | 1561010977252260_1561053017248056 | Unfortunately unless she gets a Democratic controlled Senate and takes more seats in the house,and do nothing republicans will do more of the same thing they have done the last eight years.letting this country go further down hill.
10 | Craig J. Doucette | 6 | 1561010977252260_1561079110578780 | Obama's legacy is this, he doubled the debt, he escalated the wars, he made it possible for men to use the ladies restrooms, he golfed and vacationed a lot. He opened relations with Cuba (the one good thing)
11 | Robert LaBelle | 10 | 1561010977252260_1561021680584523 | Actually , she has been watching the Obama administration and will probably.be able to get much more done with her selection of Supreme court
12 | Lara Ladner | 5 | 1561010977252260_1561093593910665 | Crazy hag hasn't even been propelled in yet and you fake wanna be journalist are already trying to make excuses for her. Welcome to the next for years of watching America go further down the crappier.
13 | Diana Washington | 2 | 1561010977252260_632195946958877 | It's called evidence in the United States of America you have to have evidence to arrest charge and convicted person in a court of law that's America where do you think you are they can investigate anyone they want but you still have to have evidence to charge a person with a crime and they don't have any but you people don't want to believe that
14 | David Pohocsucut | 1 | 1561010977252260_1835549806690217 | What could Hillary Clinton actually get done as president? Besides flooding our country with muslims and illegals and increasing the number of murdered babies and destroy what is left of our economy and bring even more corruption and further lower the bar for morality in our nation and giving away national secrets and whoring out the oval office and starting world war 3, She will get nothing done. Nothing she wants will improve Americans lives.
15 | Anne Fleming Petherick | 3 | 1561010977252260_1561089833911041 | What she WON'T do is more important. She won't start ear over an obscenities gesture She won't unravel women's rights and LGBTQ rights...she will fight for reasonable gun control measures and humane immigration laws...etc.
16 | Monte Miller | 3 | 1561010977252260_1561077843912240 | I would give the republicans a choice. Drop the investigation threat. They have no authority. Investigations are done by the FBI and the Justice department. The case against Clinton is closed. If I were Clinton I would bring the house republicans up on election sabotage. Treason, abuse of power, violating the separation of powers, and failure to honor their oaths of office to represent all the people not just some right wing jerks in a district. George Bush's lawyer is going to file charges against them for ethics violations as well. Personally If I was Madame President Clinton I would lock them all up and completely justified!
17 | Selwyn Amataiti | 4 | 1561010977252260_1561014530585238 | Well Hillary Clinton will win the white house, because my Lord God blasphemy he so happy, because his ready to wipe you American out of this world, because Donald trump is going alone, and remember you American need me Selwyn with the spirit, because Donald trump will have no hope,because blasphemy my Lord God has set you up with Donald trump to destroy you!with my help from the heaven we are voting for Hillary Clinton!
18 | Charles Lewis | 0 | 1561010977252260_1835566303355234 | Electing Hillary is only the first step, we need to turn the house and Senate blue or nothing will get done. Republicans are big sore losers if they don't win then nobody wins
19 | Joe Upton | 2 | 1561010977252260_1561087077244650 | What else would you expect from the GOP but the same do-nothing, drag-your-feet, but pay me anyway lifetime political drivel? Its what they've given us the last eight years, and what we can expect for the next eight under Clinton. And the really hysterical part is, if you ask them why they've become so extreme, they'll tell you stuff wasn't getting done fast enough.
20 | Jay Martin | 1 | 1561010977252260_632195463625592 | Hillary Clinton is a get it done political machine,backroom deals where people walk away feeling shamed with a pocket full of money,are the norm.
21 | Bill Roudabush | 0 | 1561010977252260_1835574283354436 | Here is a quote from Obama "ordinary people are to small minded to manage their own lives governments should have more control over people" voting for Clinton or any Democrat is voting for a type of government the founding father's tired to protect us from when they wrote the Constitution. If Clinton wins the election you can kiss what's left of the Republic of the United States goodbye along with more of your rights and your freedoms. Our Constitution has been under attack sense 9/11 especially for the last 8 years.
22 | Richard Myer | 7 | 1561010977252260_1561060867247271 | Nothing  will get done. Just like in her 30yrs she has already been in the government. Other then more and more american lives lost because of her selling out this country to terrorists! But I'm sure she will make her millions while the rest of the country suffers at her feet!

24 | Elizabeth Enefaah Georgewill | 1 | 1561010977252260_632195620292243 | she had several opportunities to actualise greatest good for humanity but she rather killed and increased lies and looting. she is one of the most dangerous women/humans on this earth; for she works not only for britsh bloody elizabeth, but she is also personally a killer and a thief; so is trump and the others: descendant of lynden johnson, et al. they all are not worthy and the collegiate, both houses, fbi, cia and the military, the parties and the past and present presidents  and government to be sued by the People, for deception, looting and increased imprisoning and killing.

It's their last chance to make their pleas to voters.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Terry Wickwire | 27 | 1560964557256902_1560969847256373 | We can all learn how Donald J Dump was capable of taking the Republican Party by the force of his will. Republicans will need to do some deep soul searching to redefine their Party and reinvent themselves as representative of we the people and our lives. Republicans witnessed the horror of Sandy Hook and did nothing. Republicans witnessed mass shootings all over the nation, and politicized the proliferation of more weapons. The NRA has the Republican Party by the throat, and I use Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as my proof. He said that "any Supreme Court nominees should be approved by the NRA." We need to win the Senate and demote Mitch McConnell. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that Dump's comment "is the very definition of a racist comment." Paul Ryan supports Dump. The Republican Congress approval rating is in the toilet while President Obama has unprecedented approval ratings. Americans figured out who is responsible for the dysfunction in Washington DC and we will fix Congress. Vice Presidential candidate Tea Party Pence wants Americans to believe that Donald J Dump is capable of fixing the problems of the Tea Party obstructionists making. His history speaks volumes about his own bias against the LGBT and minority communities, and if he is the standard bearer for the future of the Republican Party then they will have learned nothing. Cuban Canadian Cruz isn't any better, Marco Rubio is a sellout, Chaffetz has more skeletons than a graveyard, Gowdy is complicit with the false accusations and conspiracy theories against Hillary Clinton, Republican Governors are hated by their constituents and the Republican Party is fractured and failing. The only good news for their Party are Republicans like Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse who put content of character ahead of Party. They have a tough road ahead.I can write a book about the history of Dump and his divisive campaign, and my Facebook timeline is a treasure trove of facts that define his character flaws and immoral behaviors. His litigious future is bleak and his brand is forever tarnished, he faces felony fraud trials, a RICO trial, 169 federal lawsuits and counting and thousands of other suits for his crooked business practices. He was hoping for Executive Privilege to erase his corrupt history. He failed. Americans are going to send a resounding message to Dump and anybody else who wants to use this division as a springboard to power. Women, minorities, educated and moral people will rebuke Dump and bemuse his supporters. You're all witnessing the day when Americans stood up against authoritarian isolationism and racial profiling on our soil. America is already great because of the goodness of most of our people. History will be so much kinder to President Obama than Republicans ever were. VOTE BLUE.
2 | Donna Cleary Sturgis | 30 | 1560964557256902_1561011840585507 | The only way this crap will be over is if Trump wins.. Otherwise we will have 4 yrs, of lies, cheating and pay to play from her... And how knows how many more dead bodies..
3 | David Winch | 5 | 1560964557256902_1560990613920963 | copy and pasted from an post by Beatriz Alvaraz D'Hewe which I think raises some interesting questions...                  " Dear Donald,Tens of millions of us voters watched your debate with Hillary Clinton on Monday night. And we’re trying — really trying — to understand some of the points you made about jobs, trade, the economy and taxes.But you’ve left us confused. Some of the things you’re saying are pretty hard to follow.So could you just help us out by clarifying a few points?1. How are we are “losing all our jobs” to other countries when the private sector has generated 12 million jobs in the past five years?2. Why do you say the Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates to stop the economy from overheating, when you also say we’re in a terrible slump? Do you think the Fed should raise rates in a slump — a sure recipe for a depression — or do you think the economy is actually doing better than you admit?3. If all our jobs are going to Mexico, why do we need a wall to stop all the Mexicans moving here for work?4. Come to think of it, why would they want to come here if we are now a “third-world country” and a “hell hole”?5. According to the statistics, median personal incomes — when adjusted for infvs  ' lation — are at or near record highs and are up 5% since 2009. How exactly has President Obama been an economic disaster?6. If NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, was one of the “worst trade deals” in history, why was it immediately followed by the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, the creation of nearly 3 million new jobs a year for five years, and the biggest rise in real private-sector wages since the 1960s?7. You boast that you’re “smart” to avoid taxes, because the money would have been “squandered.” But two-thirds of all federal spending goes to defense, veterans, Social Security, Medicare and debt interest. How are you defining “squandered”?8. How do you plan to pay for your massive, $6 trillion tax cut while increasing defense and veteran spending, and without cutting any of the other three?9. Today, by every reliable statistic, the rich have never had it so good. Yet you say the middle class is in terrible shape. So why do you think the answer is to make the rich even richer by cutting their taxes?10. Come to think of it, aren’t you arguing that the middle class did better in the 1990s (when, the IRS says, the top 400 taxpayers paid an average rate of 28% a year) than in the past decade (when they’ve paid just 18%)?11. You plan to cut the inheritance tax paid by super-rich heirs from 45% to 20%. How is that not self-dealing, when by your own estimates that would save your own kids about $2.5 billion?12. If China is aggressively devaluing its currency to undermine us, why has it risen 24% against the dollar in the past 10 years?13. The conservative Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reckons your tax-and-spending plans would raise the national debt to $28 trillion by 2026. If, as you say, we are in a terrible crisis now because our (gross) national debt is nearly $20 trillion, how will we be better off when it’s 40% higher?14. Dubai, which is part of the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait are tiny dictatorships with lots of oil and few people. Why do you think our infrastructure issues are remotely comparable to theirs?15. You’ve said it was “smart” and “normal business practice” to use bankruptcy laws to escape your creditors. Former President Harry Truman, famously, refused to do just that when his store folded. Instead he worked for 15 years to pay back every dollar he owed. Did that make him stupid? Equally, millions of middle-class Americans refused to default on their mortgages during the housing crisis, even when they could have done so. Were they stupid too?If you could just clarify those few points, we’d all be really grateful. Thanks!Yours,The Voters
4 | Tim Banes | 8 | 1560964557256902_1561000350586656 | The Clintons will very soon be a thing of the past and very soon we will also begin to drain the swamp in Washington D.C. of all politicians who have served themselves with their political careers and have forgotten about the American electorate. The time has come when we will see clearly what the future holds for us because finally someone by the name of Donald Trump had the courage to stand up against the Washington elites and has shaken the political arena to its core. No more of the same for we the people have spoken loud and clear and have decided that enough is enough. GO TRUMP/PENCE!!
5 | Alex Mogo | 11 | 1560964557256902_1560971840589507 | 1 more day of this torture and its over!! When The Trump Campaign sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're sending red necks. They're sending white trash. They're Sending F.B.I. Republican Hit-Jobs, They're sending low life POS. They're sending Right Wing Breitbart KKK Conspiracy Lies , They're sending KGB Russian Hackers to Attack America and Rig the election for TRUMP, They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems to us. They're bringing hate. They're bringing fear. They're deplorable and some, I assume are good people!!!???

9 | Tim Banes | 3 | 1560964557256902_1560999347253423 | Albert Einstein is broadly credited with exclaiming “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results”. And this is exactly what you get. SAME results with Hillary as you received with Obama. But let me guess, You have done ZERO research?..Here, Let me educate you. Innocent Republican men and women are being attacked by goons, paid to incite violence on Hillary's dime. Is this the America you want your children grow up in? The dishonest media is guilty. Journalistic integrity is nonexistent and propaganda is the norm. You can’t have government corruption, without media corruption. We have both. We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system? You seem to gloss over all FACTS of today's society as a whole, And focus squarely on your dislike of Mr.Trump. Hillary will ONLY CONTINUE and ENHANCE what I have stated above. This again is FACT. Perhaps you should vote from a Adult standpoint for your country. Not from personal, emotional viewpoint of sour grapes against Mr. Trump.
10 | Gerald Gray | 0 | 1560964557256902_1561026293917395 | A prayer for this country...Hear my prayer Lord,Father forgive us for turning our back on you. As a nation, we have allowed your Word to be taken out of our society. We have allowed untold numbers of children to be murdered. We have stood silently by and watched a once great country; founded on your truths and principles become a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah. We have watched your church sell its soul for the golden idol of a 501C tax classification. We have allowed some of your children to be treated so poorly; and not cried out for justice. I beseech you Father please do not abandon us in our time of need. I ask you Father that you would be merciful on your children so that we might yet repent and return to the love of our youth. Spare us Lord if you can find just a few righteous crying out for mercy. We are so torn and divided; we are no longer one nation under God.Your humble child who has not kept your word all the days of his life, and is a sinner Lord; but who tries to live his life as you would require; yet too often fails, begs for mercy on this land. Never the less Lord thy will be done.AmenAnonymous.
11 | Larry Crucetti | 0 | 1560964557256902_1561141927239165 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.

17 | Rin Kate Watt | 1 | 1560964557256902_1560989337254424 | In Florida and North Carolina a third-party vote could easily tip the entire country to Trump. The margin is that close. And no sane third-party voter  really wants to see Trump in the White House. Be sane, be practical, at least if you're in one of these vital, too-close-to-be-sure states.  Don't let Trump's dangerous agenda (anti-women, anti-choice, anti-minority, anti-environment, anti-LGBT, anti-science, anti-education, anti-social programs, anti-diplomacy...) get elected!
18 | William Todd | 0 | 1560964557256902_1561155407237817 | In 6hrs it will be over... if Hillary wins and she seriously could win... then its a lot more over than you could imagine. Look, I live outside the US so whoever is president would affect me very little. My perspective has always been opinion of better policy. I have no reason to choose a candidate based on fear and I wouldn't vote using my bible. Honestly, if I used my Bible to vote... Neither Trump or Hillary would be the choice. They both have a lot of negative attributes, cannot be denied... but which one has been there for 30yrs now milking the system but putting very little back into it? I respect your choices, Ive had my fun Hillary bashing... time to get serious now. #VoteTrump . Be safe at the polls, its a place to vote, not a place to fight. Respect each other and let the best candidate win.

Vishnu Shal Being from India and watching in i cannot believe how biased the corporate run media is...even here in India and Europe the only headlines we read are the ones attacking Trump in this one sided election, never any articles about Benghazi or the trail of blood and destruction Obama and Clinton have left across Syria and the Middle East, so much for responsible informed journalism and impartiality...sickening.

Who in the right mind would vote to embrace corruption and let this country become one of the third world? Corruption is a cancer of third world countries. It drags them into poverty, debt, lawlessness and despair. WikiLeaks has added fire and meaning to the email issue. Now, we know that not only did Hillary place American security at risk, but has exposed an entire corrupt network.

1 | Ryan Lyons | 228 | 1560907260595965_1560931673926857 | Trump is the WORST thing to ever happen to America. He has made people HATE again. He has divided a nation that will take forever to heal and he has done it through his racism, hate, and bigotry. He is a con a crook and sexual pervert that belongs behind bars.
2 | Efrain Reyes | 114 | 1560907260595965_1560932620593429 | Trump's done. Buh bye Trump. We can't risk Trump to nominate 3 justices in the Supreme Court. I despise Hillary Clinton, but we will hold her accountable. On the plus side, Bernie Sanders could become the new chairman of the Senate Budget Committee if Democrats take over control of the Senate.
3 | James Laubhan | 54 | 1560907260595965_1560935140593177 | even if he looses tomorrow he's caused so much damage it will be hard to recover. He's given a platform for all the racist, sexist, hate filled people to have a voice, and I just hope and pray that tomorrow he will somehow say something to his sheep to come together again as a country on the concession speech. You people seem to follow every word and action he says so I hope he will do the right thing for the good of America tomorrow night.
4 | Liz Zelenski | 28 | 1560907260595965_1560939517259406 | Poor fella going to be lost without the rallies... Maybe you can rally again someday to raise funds to pay for your legal trouble at the end of the month.. You'll have a little time while president Clinton is transitioning into the white house
5 | David Winch | 17 | 1560907260595965_1560935457259812 | copy and pasted from an post by Beatriz Alvaraz D'Hewe which I think raises some interesting questions...                  " Dear Donald,Tens of millions of us voters watched your debate with Hillary Clinton on Monday night. And we’re trying — really trying — to understand some of the points you made about jobs, trade, the economy and taxes.But you’ve left us confused. Some of the things you’re saying are pretty hard to follow.So could you just help us out by clarifying a few points?1. How are we are “losing all our jobs” to other countries when the private sector has generated 12 million jobs in the past five years?2. Why do you say the Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates to stop the economy from overheating, when you also say we’re in a terrible slump? Do you think the Fed should raise rates in a slump — a sure recipe for a depression — or do you think the economy is actually doing better than you admit?3. If all our jobs are going to Mexico, why do we need a wall to stop all the Mexicans moving here for work?4. Come to think of it, why would they want to come here if we are now a “third-world country” and a “hell hole”?5. According to the statistics, median personal incomes — when adjusted for inflation — are at or near record highs and are up 5% since 2009. How exactly has President Obama been an economic disaster?6. If NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, was one of the “worst trade deals” in history, why was it immediately followed by the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, the creation of nearly 3 million new jobs a year for five years, and the biggest rise in real private-sector wages since the 1960s?7. You boast that you’re “smart” to avoid taxes, because the money would have been “squandered.” But two-thirds of all federal spending goes to defense, veterans, Social Security, Medicare and debt interest. How are you defining “squandered”?8. How do you plan to pay for your massive, $6 trillion tax cut while increasing defense and veteran spending, and without cutting any of the other three?9. Today, by every reliable statistic, the rich have never had it so good. Yet you say the middle class is in terrible shape. So why do you think the answer is to make the rich even richer by cutting their taxes?10. Come to think of it, aren’t you arguing that the middle class did better in the 1990s (when, the IRS says, the top 400 taxpayers paid an average rate of 28% a year) than in the past decade (when they’ve paid just 18%)?11. You plan to cut the inheritance tax paid by super-rich heirs from 45% to 20%. How is that not self-dealing, when by your own estimates that would save your own kids about $2.5 billion?12. If China is aggressively devaluing its currency to undermine us, why has it risen 24% against the dollar in the past 10 years?13. The conservative Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reckons your tax-and-spending plans would raise the national debt to $28 trillion by 2026. If, as you say, we are in a terrible crisis now because our (gross) national debt is nearly $20 trillion, how will we be better off when it’s 40% higher?14. Dubai, which is part of the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait are tiny dictatorships with lots of oil and few people. Why do you think our infrastructure issues are remotely comparable to theirs?15. You’ve said it was “smart” and “normal business practice” to use bankruptcy laws to escape your creditors. Former President Harry Truman, famously, refused to do just that when his store folded. Instead he worked for 15 years to pay back every dollar he owed. Did that make him stupid? Equally, millions of middle-class Americans refused to default on their mortgages during the housing crisis, even when they could have done so. Were they stupid too?If you could just clarify those few points, we’d all be really grateful. Thanks!Yours,The Voters
6 | Mustapha Konneh | 12 | 1560907260595965_1560955443924480 | I have a  friend of mine who is disabled. I have seen the pain that guy is going through, I have seen  things that are simple for the rest of us, becomes so hard for him. When I saw Trump, a man who can potentially be the President Of The greatest country on earth mocked a disabled reporter..." I WEPT .... What kind of man mockes people with disabilities. I AM PRAYING HARD THAT HE LOSES. HE IS DESPICABLE!!!!
7 | Rick Trombley | 9 | 1560907260595965_1560937567259601 | He actually thinks that head of hair looks good.  Wow - now we know he's an idiot. Wonder what will happen to that hair after his trial in December.  Can't wait for that show to begin.  Of course, he'll probably say that it was all rigged!!!  Oh well, Humpty Trumpty is about to fall.
8 | Margie Jones Grundy | 5 | 1560907260595965_1560998493920175 | Trump displays most of the symptoms of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. He's conceited, boastful, pretentious, and demeaning to others, and he thinks only of himself, lacks empathy, believes he's always right, never apologizes, monopolizes conversations, feels entitled to do whatever he wants, is hyper-sensitive to anything he perceives as criticism, is easily angered, lacks self control, and acts impulsively.If short-tempered, paranoid, impulsive Donald Trump is elected president he'll have access to the nuclear codes, and if he's as trigger-happy with those codes as he is with his Twitter account, that's a bad thing.
9 | Louis Morningstar | 3 | 1560907260595965_1560966180590073 | I must thank the American people for such a hilarious election,  I have laughed and laughed and laughed! 😈 What great chaos!
10 | Debbie Hoover | 9 | 1560907260595965_1560942330592458 | Vote Trump on Tuesday, so we don't have to have someone in the White House who will lie, cheat, steal to get what she wants. You have no choice but to vote for Trump if you want a better America!!
11 | Paul Hayward | 1 | 1560907260595965_1560947390591952 | This election has pit friend against friend, family member against family member... it's a bit tragic considering BOTH candidates have a 59% unfavorable rating.... Yet we all must come to our own conclusion. I applaud all those who care - who vote with conscience... but as for me, I cannot allow the Juggernaut that rolled over Bernie Sanders - the Clinton Juggernaut.... the Clinton Foundation, with it's entourage of Soros, Bloomberg, and their Minions of Lawyers, Lobbyists, Panderers, and Multi-National Contributors - to continue to obfuscate our due process for their personal gain. I can no longer condone the "Public Doesn't Need To Know" atmosphere that has permeated EVERY Clinton Involved Crisis. I can no longer accept the "business as usual" atmosphere of Washington DC where obvious crimes are committed, but no culprit is ever named - NO ONE gets jail time, and some even get bonuses. I can no longer tolerate Agencies writing Law, subverting the due process of parliamentary law, and the input of the Voter. I can no longer stand the appointing of individuals with clear Conflicts of Interest to Government Panels and Agencies. I have come to HATE how the Citizens of the Republic are not given the TRUTH, but must dig it up on their own from the likes of Snowden and Assange. This machine we speak of is well oiled, and has been poised for this moment for quite some time. All who stand to gain are poised with it, and we already know it's direction, and it's yielding to the wishes of corporations and contributors. Though we ALL KNOW this MUST NOT continue, you must follow your instincts and make a value judgement when you vote, that cannot be rescinded. Trump is now running to be The New Apprentice - to a job where his experience will be tested. Some feel his "bull in a china shop" attitude might well be just what DC needs. Could he be the "tough drill sergeant" that everyone hates and is yet indispensable? Is Trump the "tough love" that our Nation needs at this juncture? One expects that there would be fewer $400 hammers bought by the military during a Trump tenure... and that perhaps under new Administration, we would not leave millions of dollars of military equipment in the desert for our enemies to then use against us.... one might conclude that some needless governmental middle and upper management jobs might come under scrutiny... and some would be FIRED. The possibility of renegotiated trade deals and medicare drug prices would be welcome to most. And THEN there's the possibility that the reports from 61 Inspector Generals and the entire General Accounting Office (GAO) on how to reduce Government Spending, now largely ignored, might FINALLY actually be listened to. But most of all?? Maybe we will finally stop kidding ourselves and recognize that the Highest-In-The-World Taxes that we have burdened American Business with (in order to pay for our wars and welfare) is PRECISELY what has led to the migration of American Jobs overseas AND by proxy, led to millions of hours of lost work, and has caused our ongoing recession. The DNC platform of higher taxes will most assuredly drive MORE money and talent desperately needed for our continued recovery overseas. I will therefore, albeit somewhat reluctantly, vote for Trump. I want OFF this Hellbound Train, and it is apparent to me that we now find ourselves in yet another situation of "No Risk - No Gain". So, follow your heart, your conscience, and your best sensibilities. I would fight for your right to do so. In conclusion, I Wish The Best of Luck to You All, and Especially to Our Nation - where, no doubt, no matter Who Wins, one of the largest political movements in History will begin November 9th... when I will stand With You in the Spirit of Working Both Sides of the Aisle for the Work yet to be Done.

In 2014 NBC News investigated the death of Victor White, a 22-year-old black man who died from a gunshot wound while handcuffed in the back of an Iberia Parish patrol car. The district attorney declined to press charges in the case and a coroner's report ruled the death a SUICIDE" There are many cases in Louisiana that the Coroner has put SUICIDE on the death certificate when a person of color dies when it was actually Homicide. I know this happened to two of my relatives one was hit by a car and the other was murdered and the police down in St Mary parish put suicide on their report. Our family used the MEDIA to tell the public how our family members death was being recorded by the coroner. So yes the Media does make a difference when the auhorities are doing people wrong. Maybe NBC News should do a report on how many death certificates have "SUICIDE" on them when they were actually murdered.

2 | Naim Nazha | 9 | 1560904230596268_1560907357262622 | When we control the borders then people who are eligible to immigrate can come earlier and do not have to wit 3 to 5 years in limbo, only someone like Trump can pass immigration reform,

And no sane third-party voter  really wants to see Trump in the White House. Be sane, be practical, at least if you're in one of these vital, too-close-to-be-sure states.  Don't let Trump's dangerous agenda (anti-women, anti-choice, anti-minority, anti-immigrant, anti-environment, anti-LGBT, anti-science, anti-education, anti-social programs, anti-diplomacy...) get elected!

If the Republican party keeps control of the House, the prospect of Donald J. Trump wining the presidency could come with major implications.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | PC Arndt | 77 | 1560856343934390_1560874320599259 | I was asked how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste from a fellow deplorable Trumpian.
2 | Edith Lilly Rose | 29 | 1560856343934390_1560866560600035 | Tbh I don't think enough people do their research when voting on anything other than the president. It truly doesn't make sense that people would vote democratic for executive but republican for legislative like they did in '12.

4 | Rosalynd Chante Elaine Doyle | 13 | 1560856343934390_1560887017264656 | Criminal investigations of Hillary Clinton with no evidence of Hillary Clinton committing a crime. So Republicans believe that Hillary Clinton committed a crime even though the FBI says she did not. Yet these are the same people who are screaming blue lives matter and think cops are above the law and support them breaking the law and committing murder. But you're mad over Hillary's emails. And I get it it's Shady!!! But how do you say somebody who has been proven not to be a criminal time and time again if somehow worse than somebody who has committed numerous crimes and has robbed numerous people of their hard-earned money. And has found loopholes to not pay taxes and boast about it. Not to mention an admission to sexually assaulting women he's raped his own wife. He's on trial for fraud he committed fraud. He's filed how many bankruptcies? And my feelings that bankruptcy is in his corporations dissolving and taxpayers eating the cost of that he stayed a billionaire. How do you expect him to actually be concerned about you. He's going to Washington to look out for his own pocketbook in the pockets of his friends who are super rich. And that is it he doesn't care about the people and his plans to bring jobs in to America is to bring back factory works such as car manufacturers but make it so where you dissolve unions so that they can pay you $7.25 an hour for a job that is that hard that physically demanding. But that's what you want you want to be paid minimum wage for a job that requires you to work to the Bone and then that way Donald Trump and his CEO friends can stay super rich and you can say Super poor and then America continues the gap between the rich and the poor, and the American dream becomes even harder to achieve. Because the top one percent of the United States will still own 90% of the wealth. And that is literally what he is telling you and his arguments is that he wants to keep the top 1% owning 90% of the wealth while 90%of the nation tries to divide 10% of the welt between 90% of the population. Which will eventually lead to another great depression! I don't like Hillary I didn't vote for her but it's it's her or him I'll have to suck it up

24 | Cesar Cisneros | 2 | 1560856343934390_1560869903933034 | Cesar Cisneros for president of The United States of America.........2016.......Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine do not have good judgment. Hillary Clinton is corrupted along with president Obama . These people don't have good judgement. America is suffering because of these kind of people. These  people are Career politicians. That's all they know how to do. They have been in politics all their lives. They don't know what you need for your family and your family's future and the future of America.They don't know what you need to be happy and the happiness of your family. They love to be in power. Hillary got rich by being in politics. I believe these people never had a real job. My fellow Americans don't vote for this kind of people. I love you, may God bless you and may God bless The United States of America.
25 | Connie Condran | 4 | 1560856343934390_1560875047265853 | The only implication if Trump wins is that all the lies and corruption will be exposed. He can't be bought off to keep the lies a secfret and that scares the hell out of all these corrupt polititions. Ever wonder what foreigners think of our election/media, here's an example....  Vishnu Shal Being from India and watching in i cannot believe how biased the corporate run media is...even here in India and Europe the only headlines we read are the ones attacking Trump in this one sided election, never any articles about Benghazi or the trail of blood and destruction Obama and Clinton have left across Syria and the Middle East, so much for responsible informed journalism and impartiality...sickening. Trump 2016

1 | Geoff Gentel | 395 | 1560748370611854_1560750473944977 | It makes sense why he was trying to help Trump. Sexual Predators always look out for each other.
2 | Christine Marie | 150 | 1560748370611854_1560758983944126 | Julian Assange is not a sexual predator. Like Edward Snowden and Manning he has uncovered corruption. The man is being set up in retaliation for showing the American people they are pawns for a corrupt system. I stand with Julian Assange he deserves a metal.
3 | Jonie Miller | 55 | 1560748370611854_1560755567277801 | This is a deflection on his wikileaks drop tomorrow.. hence -HRC campaign stating don't believe any of the next Wikileaks.. and since they dropped more emails last night when their twitter was shutdown.. he is a patriot!!🇺🇸🙏🏼Maga!!
4 | Baraka Dimson | 32 | 1560748370611854_1560781263941898 | If he and his people were equally leaking all type of things about Trump and the RNC and hacking into their emails then we can say their sole objective is to uncover the truth BUT they have clearly demonstrated that they are working with and for Russia to help the head of the deplorable movement.....Trump rig our election and undermine our democracy! Not going to happen dirt bag! HILLARY2016 all the way!
5 | David Camm | 17 | 1560748370611854_1560797480606943 | Here is another self important jerk that deserves his come uppance. He has no right to influence an election so close to the day. I don't want people like him deciding who will be President..He was hine until he started using his power from stolen info to suit himself and his choosing who will win the election.
6 | Mike Rashid | 40 | 1560748370611854_1560750737278284 | I get a chuckle out of the libtards thinking that the Hildebeast will win because the FBI closed one of the two cases they have her on. Trump voters outnumber the brain dead by millions. We got this! #spiritcooking #lolitaexpress #wikileaks #projectveritas #draintheswamp
7 | Tarus Morgan | 13 | 1560748370611854_1560785283941496 | This scum should face his own crimes before criticizing others...!!  I don't care what's in people's emails that's around Hillary.. There's nothing worse than rape!!
8 | Digna Regina Peguero Diaz | 6 | 1560748370611854_1560782793941745 | It's about time this person is asked about it! Ecuador will have to have the last word about for how long will they keep him in their embassy. It's not enough that they cut his internet service while he's there,sooner than later they'll have to take matters about it,because this man has envolved this country,involuntary,in the things he's accountable of.
9 | Erick Córtez | 27 | 1560748370611854_1560761320610559 | What's ridiculously funny about this guy is: he can steal information across the world from everyone, find everyone's dark dirty secrets BUT he can't find one single piece of information to clear his own name from the rape charge he faces.
10 | Alex Frost | 18 | 1560748370611854_1560752653944759 | The same Sweden that gave a free pass to Refugees who gang raped a wheelchair-bound woman because she didn't protest enough.
11 | Elke Hassell | 6 | 1560748370611854_1560778823942142 | Interesting to bring up the "Rape" case again. It was DROPPED the only reason he is there cause they would make him go to Sweden and then will be extradited to the States where he will face very similar things as Mannings - Torture
12 | Henry Garcia | 1 | 1560748370611854_1560906367262721 | Donald Trump The “great shameless, audacious bawler”. In any other election this might seem super wacky but it seems par for the course this time around."Eussouis" is obviously the name of Trump's next imported wife. The false message about the rigged election, to run through the city stopping the broken pact; voices bought, chapel stained with blood, the empire contracted to another one. Rigged election? Broken pact? By the shaven head a very bad choice will come to be made, Overburdened he will not pass the gate: He will speak with such great fury and rage, That to fire and blood he will consign the entire sex. WikiLeaks Editor Julian Assange Compares Him To White Trash. He's mad, he's bad, and he's on track to be the Republican U.S. President in the 2016 general election—to the horror of everyone not already supporting him, including his own party. The false trumpet concealing madness will cause Byzantium to change its laws. From there will go forth a man who wants the edict withdrawn, changing money and standards. Donald Trump ("the false trumpet") is concealing his own madness. As U.S. President, he will cause Byzantium, a key entry point into the west for refugees! — to change its laws and will "want the edict withdrawn," presumably because if the displaced millions are not going north, they're going south. Trump, here, is enraged: someone or something has betrayed him. In the name of religion, he talks blood and he ends up swimming in it. He makes a big show of friendship and eating dirt for his efforts. Trump has described his intention of being a 'neutral broker' between Israel and Palestine—the sort of hubris that could make things much worse when he learns everyone is smarter than he expected and not giving an inch. What options would Trump then have, given a $700 billion military budget and a desperate, narcissistic need to solve whatever problem is making a fool of him? Trump being unable to get America (the republic) to go on some expensive military adventure. So he tells Britain to do the work. As it begins America realizes it needs to do its part. Trump looks like a fool and must repent. This could be some kind of risky humanitarian thing that reeks of more immigrants, perhaps -- evacuating Tripoli from an ISIS siege would be ultra. The U.S. Senate makes a show of supporting Trump, but stabs him in the back: he's impeached or ditched after four years. But then "at the sound of the trump his adherents will be there", selling their possessions and expelling enemies. The final apotheosis of Trumpism: the personality cult of a one-term loser.
13 | Keith Alan Gordon | 2 | 1560748370611854_1560815593938465 | This is not proper procedure. The Swedes should be doing the questioning. It is also being done on the grounds of the Ecuadorian Embassy. Only the laws of Ecuador will be enforce. This is another shame.
14 | Sean Williams | 6 | 1560748370611854_1560760503943974 | This is a Bipartisan effort to get Julian Assange and they need to lock him up for Espionage. He can be a coward and sit in the Embassy for years all he wants but guess what Ecuador has an extradition treaty with The United States.
15 | Connie Daniels | 0 | 1560748370611854_725527490932787 | ok for nearly a year he has been releasing emails and corruption of the Clintons and others and today, the day before he is going to release the biggie that the clinton;s are already denying ahead of time and what for the first time we are seeing Assange accused of a crime, really?? You would have to be a fool to swallow that bait.
16 | Dee Smith Wesson | 3 | 1560748370611854_1560822430604448 | I see trumps supporters say that trump and the dude are "innocent until proven guilty" lmao wow so only white men are innocent until proven guilty but women (hillary) are guilty in your eyes, and when a black man is killed while unarmed y'all say he's guilty. Smh
17 | Davenport Barbara | 2 | 1560748370611854_1560830673936957 | soooooo, embassies are really like "reverse jails" in that the "prisoner/criminal" is serving a self imposed sentence so he doesn't have to serve time in a real jail.  WOW, does he have to pay rent or does he live there for free?  Suprised embassies aren't overflowing this shitbags like this.
18 | Prakash Bom | 1 | 1560748370611854_1560794530607238 | Rapists are messing up with the established societies around the world. This guy must be put behind the bar for his rape crime committed in Sweden.
19 | Reaper Ric | 2 | 1560748370611854_1164665136916283 | Well it seems to be an obvious reach for anything to reign him in. I'm sure the verdict has already been decided as well. I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up missing or dead.
20 | Francisco Campos | 1 | 1560748370611854_1164583723591091 | They should speak with the Clintons about the 33 Haitian children their good friend Laura Silsby was caught trying to traffic.Or they should ask them about the 20+ trips they took with billionaire pedophile Jefferey Epstein to his private island.Or ask Bill about the MULTIPLE rape and sexual harassment charges brought against him?Why don't they ask John Podesta about the sick things he talks about in his emails? Such as Spirit Cooking, about having Hot Tub parties with CHILDREN 11,9,7 years of age.. LOOK IT UP I could go on and on and on.
21 | Michael Reed | 5 | 1560748370611854_1560763260610365 | Funny how the two biggest anti-Clinton folks to appear on the 2016 Election Stage BOTH have been accused of rape. What's even more frightening for me is the folks on the left that have followed Julian's words as if they were gospel. (You know who you are)
22 | David Foote | 2 | 1560748370611854_1560802020606489 | Your story is such a hit Job and void of facts!! People should just know the world powers are at stake! They will do anything to keep their work secret! Exposing human trafficking and pedophilia is just not something they want you to know right now!!!
23 | Dave Sweatman | 1 | 1560748370611854_1560923137261044 | I don't know anything about this case, but knowing what we know now about what the Democrats will do to discredit somebody and steal an election, it wouldn't surprise me if somebody was using this to silence him
24 | Betty Lamp | 1 | 1560748370611854_1560906603929364 | The woman who was at the center of the rape case has already come out and said he didn't do it, that it was a set up. That doesnt matter????
25 | Jennifer Adcock Hollahan | 5 | 1560748370611854_1560791660607525 | NBC your sick. Trying to sway people not to believe Wikileaks on the corrupt, lying and soulless wench Hillary is. I willl never watch your BS channel again.

7 | John Metallo | 160 | 1560705893949435_1560707790615912 | JAMES COMEY Obviously someone either pressured him to REOPEN or TO CLOSE ... the investigation I am not sure whichBut either way he was wrong!He should resign or be fired immediately !!!

10 | Randall E. Winn | 78 | 1560705893949435_1560711283948896 | Hillary started her career helping poor children get health care. That shows a good heart.
11 | Dale E. Swan Jr. | 37 | 1560705893949435_1560713267282031 | Votes don't count. The government chose Hillary a while back. The presidential election is as predetermined as pro wrestling.
12 | Angela C. Brooks | 23 | 1560705893949435_678486992318706 | Hillary has no regard for human life! She let 4 men die in Benghazi, she beleives in late term abortions and she let a child rapist go free and was heard laughing about it on a tape!!!!😠😠😠

17 | Dianne Sharp | 15 | 1560705893949435_1146543678774359 | What makes people think "Anything" will change with Hillary? She's had 30 years, and nothing has changed, except finding out she is "Extremely" corrupt!
18 | Jessi Oks | 13 | 1560705893949435_1773625896234434 | The first chick doesn't know anything..lol. sad..that's an ignorant vote right there.."because obama endorses her and there's goid policies"..like what? List just 2. Uniformed voting= wasted vote..

A 5.0-magnitude earthquake centered near one of the world's key oil hubs in Oklahoma brought down building facades and shattered windows. Residents were evacuated as emergency workers assessed the earthquake damage. Read more: http://nbcnews.to/2eFmTHA
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Randy Fritter | 334 | 1560656207287737_1560687213951303 | But, fracking does not cause this huh? Don't believe the hype.This is a direct result from fracking and the oil companies don't care about you, your children, your life all they care about is profit
2 | Michael Kline | 366 | 1560656207287737_1560668403953184 | Oklahoma is heading for a big series of quakes. Wonder if they will finally figure out Oil Corporations and Republicans dont have the interests of their kids and grandkids in mind.
3 | Jennifer Myers | 292 | 1560656207287737_1560683600618331 | Fracking earthquakes y'all! It's dirty and nasty. Let alone not normal. We're ruining the earth and will contaminate our water.
4 | Jo B Welborn | 140 | 1560656207287737_1560690797284278 | There were hardly any earthquakes in Oklahoma when I was growing up. This is all in the last 10 years due to fracking. But it's fine. It's allllll fiiiiiiiine.
5 | Angela Barnett-Shelton | 65 | 1560656207287737_1560700433949981 | This must stop! Make the companies responsible for this pay for all the damages. If you do not start holding corporations responsible we are all doomed. Claiming it wasn't caused by fracking is worse than calling global warming a hoax. This is all about greed (the love of the mighty dollar) which puts everyone at risk.
6 | Ken Reed | 56 | 1560656207287737_1560723750614316 | Keep fracking and denying it's effects, Oklahoma. When you have no standing homes and no clean water, maybe you'll start listening to the environmental groups that have been telling you to STOP FRACKING for years.
7 | Matt Muyres | 31 | 1560656207287737_1560740277279330 | Oklahoma. Means red man. Snow ball throwing James inhofe, the worlds angriest climate denying senator, must be shitting in his pants, knowing this earthquake was caused by his millions of fracking wells. #nodapl #waterislife
8 | Gail Dotson | 27 | 1560656207287737_1560720307281327 | I believe if you have a large flood or ,you take enough oil out of the ground ,this will cause Earthquakes ,The water erodes the rocks or dirt holding layers under us ,and causes shifting ,just as it does to remove too much oil ,and fracking is the reason Oklahoma is shaking .If we the public can understand this ,why are the experts so blind ,or they know but do not give a D%^&$
9 | Timothy Ahern | 25 | 1560656207287737_1560722790614412 | never had bad quakes before fracking in Oklahoma, Texas .. hows that working out for ya ... history is going to show fracking was BIG mistake... how many quakes ya had this year anyways
10 | Brandy Maitland | 14 | 1560656207287737_1560722043947820 | They won't stop fracking there and the quakes keep coming that state is being run by idiots.... who will run to Washington for money when a really big one happens and we all can pay for it.
11 | Pamela Britton | 15 | 1560656207287737_1560867890599902 | We need to stop the Koch bros before they completely destroy our lands. Fracking does this and since fracking started in Oklahoma there has been an increase in earth quakes and not just in Oklahoma.
12 | Ronald Goff | 16 | 1560656207287737_1560744480612243 | Does everyone understand when the oil industry talks about using waste water for fracking ... the waste water ... they are talking about is ... sewage?They're mixing together a secret mixture of chemicals and acids, with sewage water and injecting it under extreme pressure deep underground to fracture shale seams to release oil and gas deposits.What else could go wrong besides earthquakes?
13 | Laurie Michelle Johns | 11 | 1560656207287737_1560753203944704 | It astounds me that no one seems to care about those who have lost their homes. The Cimarron towers which is for the elderly and disabled was evacuated last night. Gas leaks and the theater which is right a across from the towers had the roof cave in. All you seem single minded and are only focused on what you believe causes earthquakes instead of showing concern over those who were affected and that's just sad.
14 | Amie Maynard | 4 | 1560656207287737_1561010477252310 | For anyone that doesn't believe Fracking causes earthquakes, you can begin your research here: http://www.environmentamerica.org/sites/environment/files/reports/EA_FrackingNumbers_scrn.pdf "Another public safety hazard stems from earthquakestriggered by injection wells. For example, onNew Year’s Eve in 2011—shortly after Ohio beganaccepting increasing amounts of wastewater fromPennsylvania—a 4.0 earthquake shook Youngstown,Ohio. Seismic experts at Columbia University determinedthat pumping fracking wastewater intoa nearby injection well caused the earthquake.78Earthquakes triggered by injection well wastewaterdisposal have happened in Oklahoma, Arkansas,Texas, Ohio and Colorado. The largest quake—a magnitude5.7 temblor in Oklahoma that happened in2011—injured two people, destroyed 14 homes andbuckled highways. People felt the quake as far as 800miles away.79As fracking wastewater volumes have increaseddramatically since 2007, the number of earthquakesin the central United States, where injection well disposalis common, has increased by more than 1,100percent compared to earlier decades.80 Scientistsat the U.S. Geological Survey have concluded thathumans are likely the cause.81 After reviewing dataon the Oklahoma quake, Dr. Geoffrey Abers, a seismologistat the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory,concluded that, “the risk of humans inducing largeearthquakes from even small injection activities isprobably higher” than previously thought."
15 | Fred Norton | 11 | 1560656207287737_1560752547278103 | Remember those nutcases we see every once in a while saying "repent for the end is near" At some point these nutjobs will be correct. This election, the earthquakes in Italy, the hole in the earth's magnetic field, in my opinion are signs that the end may actually be coming
16 | Bonnie Mendoza | 5 | 1560656207287737_1560796063940418 | I agree, I don't know if this one was caused by fracking, but it has been shown that where fracking occurs earthquakes follow..Still no fracking in New York,,hope we manage to keep it out!
17 | Babs Schrmack-West | 4 | 1560656207287737_1560917413928283 | Well after Oklahoma is gone.. sunk into the earth from the oil and gas industry maybe people will wake up. In the mean time the gas and oil lobbyists will continue to feed the Republican Party with money to turn their heads.
18 | Tonya Trytten | 6 | 1560656207287737_1560834143936610 | How long will people look the other way??  It's become a political  issue and it shouldn't be. It's a common sense issue, but this is what happens when corporations own our government.
19 | Gayle Cashion | 6 | 1560656207287737_1560757673944257 | Very few support investing in solar, (Hillary is hoping to be able to do that, but emails might keep it from happening). This country desperately needs to find alternative energy instead of dependence on fracking, or big money oil companies owning politicians.
20 | Roshni Slowski | 6 | 1560656207287737_1560838223936202 | Yup...Oklahoma, they will get worse. They will get bigger, and your infrastructure can't handle it. Trust me as a Californian when I say it's not fun. Stop fracking! These companies should be made to pay for damages!
21 | Ginny Lucky | 5 | 1560656207287737_1560751250611566 | They can thank the oil industry for ruining Oklahoma.  Get a clue you guys and put a stop to the greed of the oil companies.
22 | Barry Fitzman | 3 | 1560656207287737_1560776727275685 | I am quite sure that the oil companies are well protected by laws preventing the victims of earthquakes from suing for legitimate damages......Okies get what they voted for and deserve!
23 | Michael Parisella | 8 | 1560656207287737_1560703267283031 | Just like the climate, they are denying fracking causes earthquakes... Nope, nothing to see here folks... please move along.....WTF??
24 | Gina Remke-Hart | 2 | 1560656207287737_1560807137272644 | They are ruining our homes here as well and charging us more for insurance and not paying to repair our homes for the damage caused. It is a travesty. Complete insurance fraud.
25 | Brian Morris | 1 | 1560656207287737_1561033010583390 | This is not a region known for earthquakes until quite recently. Just take a look at the geologic history of the region. The only thing that has changed is the use of hydraulic fracturing to extract fossil fuels. This practice has destabilized long-dormant faults and needs to stop.

1 | Adrian Connor Evans | 251 | 1560645893955435_1560647680621923 | It's a sad day in America when someone runs for president, such as Hillary Clinton, and she has so many covert, deceptive activities that we have to rely on leaked information from an ousted journalist to see exactly how dishonest she is, and half the country blindly supports her
2 | Karl Edward | 155 | 1560645893955435_1560649500621741 | Not going to happen.  You liberal imbeciles and pretend journalists and all the sheep who blindly follow you are in for a BIG negative surprise tomorrow night.  Hillary Clinton is a pathological liar, criminal, unhinged liberal, shrill demagogue and will NEVER be elected! !
3 | Scott Hornal | 93 | 1560645893955435_1560656300621061 | NBC you better hope the polls shake out as you projected. Because if it's a landslide for Trump and an obvious lie you've been perpetrating, I don't see too much public sympathy against a movement to break up your large media concerns. Think it can't happen? Remember Ma Bell?
4 | Scott Partridge | 88 | 1560645893955435_1560652520621439 | .... as a Independent Voter this is the way I see it. After 30+ years in politics Hillary has a handful of celebrities backing her and the FBI looking into her affairs & foundation. Trump has the United States Military backing him along with the American Law Enforcement... Independent for Trump.! ( my healthcare cost doubles in 2017 also)
5 | Lisa Flores Gendron | 78 | 1560645893955435_1560653300621361 | She wasn't even smart enough to answer debate questions without cheating- CNN sent her all the questions ahead of time and no new emails show the DNC wrote questions for Ted Cruz, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. It is all rotten to the core ....the powerful elite run everything and they pull all the strings.They have her the questions.she knew she was cheating....but she kept her mouth shut.That tells you a lot
6 | Neomi Meir | 58 | 1560645893955435_1560652840621407 | The choice is simple. If you are an american and you love this country and you care fir the future of this country for your children, vote trump. If you are ilegal, or if you like the chaos and lawlessness, vote clinton.

8 | Matt White | 85 | 1560580357295322_1560591190627572 | 😂😂😂No! Trump can't and won't win this election. He even knows it that's why he keeps talking about it being rigged. His only hope was the FBI finding something on Hillary and clearly they cannot. It is going to be so much fun making fun of all you inbred Trump supporters the next four years.

15 | Ed Shovar | 20 | 1560580357295322_1560604570626234 | Trump has been heard discussing the new cabinet-level position of Secretary of Wives, which would maintain the core beliefs of Trump, Gingrich and Giuliani with respect to the peaceful transition of vows, prenups, and the establishment of a federal no-fault 30-day marriage dissolution law.

19 | Jhon Garson | 19 | 1560580357295322_1560614867291871 | "Dear Republicans, - Author -Meira WainsteinYou remember how this started, right? You got in bed with the ‘I’m mad as hell and I’m not gonna take it anymore’ Tea Party. You saw the Harvard Law Review Editor who just happened to be black and you lost your minds. You called him a Socialist. You said he never read the Constitution. You said he was a Muslim as if that were some slight when Muslims have fought and died for this country right beside citizens of every other religion. It was never enough. You never seemed to run out of the venom you spewed.You played to the fears of white, male America. “He’s coming for your guns!” How many did the Great Gun Grabber actually get? You stared at twenty children slaughtered in Sandy Hook and turned up your palms and said, “This isn’t the time to talk about gun control.”You listened and half-believed the conspiracy theorists who talked about the great conspiracy of Sandy Hook and too many of you accused the parents of being actors. The best of you, who used to care about your country first and your party second, kept silent and eventually began to participate in the madness.You sold your souls because you saw after Romney lost that you weren’t going to be sitting your man in the White House anytime soon. Reince Priebus presented his autopsy of that election. To even be competitive, you have to carry 40% of the Latino vote and 45% of the women’s vote. Let’s not even consider the black vote which Romney lost by more than 90 points! Romney only got 27% of the Latino vote.DID YOU LEARN FROM IT?You certainly swelled your ranks with a fresh infusion of “populist” infantry who had the audacity to say Obama was going to invade Texas in Operation Jade Helm. You said that he was born in Kenya and a secret agent of the Muslim Brotherhood. You were more angry at Hillary than at the murderers at Benghazi. You stood there, silent and complicit as every maniac with a mouthpiece or radio show lied and incited their listeners to hatred and worse.  When your cries of wolf fell on deaf ears, you turned up the volume.The night Obama won, the establishment met in secret and promised to do everything to make him a one term president even if it meant hurting the country. That’s what your partisanship wrought and what did you achieve? You wasted millions in taxpayer money to flog the Benghazi horse and you voted to repeal Obamacare sixty times. While you strained to do anything to make the President look bad, you shut down the government and cost the economy $24 billion. While you played brinksmanship with the full faith and credit of our government, what you really achieved was to convince the vast majority of Americans that you are incapable of governing.This time you went to the natural end of your rope and jumped the shark with Trump costing you stalwart republicans like George Will, Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol and any steward of the Nation’s security. You nominated a man for his success in business even as many of his businesses were going bankrupt and are under investigation for fraud. You apparently learned not a thing from the political train wreck that was George W. Bush.But this time is different and you know it now. There is no hiding the fact that white supremacists and the full complement of other racists and xenophobes have embraced your nominee publicly and loudly.  The last Univision poll Jorge Ramos reported had Trump with an 83% disapproval rating among Latino voters. The party that claims to be the defender of “family values” sent dreamers back across the border or deported their parents  so they have to visit them across a fence. Not only have you proven that you care nothing for their lives but your nominee intends to deport eleven million of them."You built this, own it.
20 | James Reed Crawford | 5 | 1560580357295322_997208600404739 | If you didn't think a Trump presidency could be any worse, imagine Newt Gingrich having a more powerful role in government. And you deplorable lunatics talk about your guy being an "outsider". Please, he's not only an insider, he's the worst kind. The kind that puts on a big show about his supposed plans for changing things around to what you think you want. You love to watch him talk while he loves to talks to the people you already know are part of the corruption game in Washington behind your backs. He's a fake and in your heart of hearts you know it!

In case you've forgotten, look how well he cleaned up the streets on NYC and how he handled 9/11. Let's face it folks, family values are a relic of the past on this country. Just watch TV, movies, our entrrtainers...it's very sad, but family values are a joke to the people that all too often are our children's idols and role models.

They have investigated her since 1992 at a taxpayer expense in the 100s of millions of dollars and found that she did nothing wrong.How many of her enemies could survive this and still run for president

He signed up to have his life dissected and torn apart. He is fighting for the American people & win or lose I will always respect him for that. I pray that he wins & shows the world that they were wrong about all the evil things they said about him. That he will make America Great Again for ALL Americans.

His son should be for his military duty and sacrifice, something liberals don't respect much. Go help burn a flag somewhere.
5 | Belinda Gibson | 187 | 1560553447298013_1560566397296718 | LoL....oh Lord....the media will be on a frenzy today with ANTI TRUMP headlines!!!!  P A T H E T I C !!!!! THE media has turned their backs on those of us supporting Trump.....and America is suppose to be the land OF THE FREE....I don't think so. This country is not free ....it's very clear with this election.
6 | Walter Kraft | 123 | 1560553447298013_1560569917296366 | Your son was a hero, but not the only hero..there should've been thousands of people on stage with you, because of their lies about family member a son and a daughter. The person sitting behind you in this picture and the president of United States,are the reason why many heroes like your son are dead today. Now let me give you to the fax. This is more of Donald Trump country in his little pinky, then it would be yours you are corrupt you're all about money and you have said the most ignorant racist things about this country on TV and in the newspaper from your country. You should be ashamed of yourself for what you said about this country..I don't know you but I'm gonna tell you one thing your son was the hero you're not even close to being one ever!!!that will support the people that cause your son death.. When they were an office.
7 | Nichelle Kaz | 135 | 1560553447298013_1560568923963132 | Idiot. Your 15 minutes is over. I respect your son and thank God for his service and his sacrifice. You are not the only person who sent their child into battle. Many of us have said that horrifying good bye.
8 | Sue Ellen Ford | 113 | 1560553447298013_1560571183962906 | What about the Americans she left to die in Benghazi ,do you think she is for the UNITED STATES ,she's not,they died so they could cover up their crimes .Corruption is in the White House .
9 | Tammy Proulx-Tupay | 63 | 1560553447298013_1560570470629644 | Sami J Ryan, I wouldn't count your chickens before they're hatched. Trump may beat the corrupt, lying, murdering POS and she & her idiot supporters will be buried by the American people on Tuesday.
10 | Shannon McCall | 60 | 1560553447298013_1560573207296037 | Thanks to Clinton and her colorful labeling of the American people, our country is further divided. I keep seeing "deplorable" being thrown around online when discussing politics. Calling 1/2 the nation deplorable has done nothing but drive the wedge deeper into this country.  And to all of you calling Kahn's son a hero, go to hell. You will call him a hero but his battle buddies deplorable. Go seek therapy and dump Clinton. Your brains are scrambled enough as it is.
11 | Debbie Twohig | 51 | 1560553447298013_1560600437293314 | Khan you are so wrong..This is our America..not yours..You've held a grudge since your son was killed over 12 yrs ago by your own people..He knew what he was getting into when he joined..Look how many of our people that have been killed by your people..It's your war that our men are fighting so all can have the freedom that we have..You should be thanking the US for all that it has done..but instead it's the hatred that is in your heart because your son was killed..
12 | Sandra Foster Sundell | 42 | 1560553447298013_1560637413956283 | I noticed 90% of the comments are pro Trump. Mr. Kahn lost his son but so did hundreds of families. But the other families weren't paid by the DNC to speak either. So sad.
13 | John G Locke | 38 | 1560553447298013_1560574487295909 | He's actually right according to the 18 page Muslim Brotherhood plan for America. They want to destroy our country from within and have stated this openly. Look what's going on right now! It's working...
14 | Jack Rougeaux | 30 | 1560553447298013_1560611337292224 | Hillary Clinton calls Trump supporters deplorables racist sexist xenophobia homophobic. Bernie Sanders supporters basement dwellers , black men super predators .Latinos taco bowl. Then she brings Khan out to campaign for her a Muslim that believes in Sharia law. Now she claims she wants to bring the country together. Hillary Clinton shows really bad judgment.
15 | Dale Meyer | 28 | 1560553447298013_1560609257292432 | This Khan is an embarrassment for our country! His sons service has been placed for a bought out political gain! He should be ashamed of himself! Lying in his sons behalf! A total looser!
16 | Andreas Eldracher | 25 | 1560553447298013_1560601860626505 | Sit Down Khan...You sacrificed your son to make yourself look good with your own agenda of terrorist insertion into America. Trump would be proud to have your son as a citizen of the US and proud that he served and sacrificed for America. Not the paid for illusion by the Clinton administration you portray as some sort of obscure vengeance ...You should be another criminal that the FBI should investigate.
17 | Nikhita Jain | 18 | 1560553447298013_1560611390625552 | Can somebody please ask this person of Pakistani origin what's the state of Hindus and Christians in his native country Pakistan...........he lectures others but he should actually put some humanity into the heads of his brothers
18 | Marlene Sommer | 20 | 1560553447298013_1560632097290148 | Interesting that Hillary and Mr Khan are pairing to get the minority vote!!! Where is the America for Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods? #REMEMBERtheLIVESlostINbenghazi!!!!!
19 | Rob Maynard | 19 | 1560553447298013_1560609610625730 | Khizr Khan is a moron. Of course your son who is a legal citizen would have a place in the U.S. thats the dumbest question this guy could ask, besides what makes him so special? There are other gold star families suffering the loss of a loved one for a war Hillary voted on and of course like the Illegal email setup called it a mistake.
20 | Charles Klump | 23 | 1560553447298013_1560571880629503 | This b _ _ _ h is milking this poor family's tragedy to the hilt---if she is not example of a low life human than nothing is, including myself....
21 | Stacy Armstrong | 25 | 1560553447298013_1560569493963075 | Your people will not own this country! Vote Trump to keep out sharia law! Khan will rape your 9 year old daughter and throw your gay son off a roof to his death!
22 | Michael Bilotti | 16 | 1560553447298013_1560596663960358 | They were legally here. This argument is ridiculous. And quite frankly I'm sick of hearing it. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt candidate this country has ever seen and the fact is that most women are voting for her because she is a women, millennials because Trump respondents what most want but don't have the heart or drive to attain so the resent him, and minority's because she promises what she can't and would never deliver. Same thing happened in 08 where we had to set a new record for the sake of setting it. Real good that did us. When is our country going to get their common sense back!
23 | Tony Yammine | 9 | 1560553447298013_1560619320624759 | The guy had nothing to do with your son getting killed. You should have gotten mad at all the politicians you were speaking to.
24 | Bob Ferenc | 14 | 1560553447298013_1560619197291438 | Mr Khan, I am sorry for your loss but what you are doing is blood money paid to you by the person that has caused the deaths of many. Trump did not kill your son and had nothing to do with it. Face facts. A word or two does not replace actions and you will say whatever the highest bidder tells you to say. So sad.
25 | Celicia Longoria | 8 | 1560553447298013_1560602707293087 | Trump and Wikileaks(FBI? )  are Putin’s puppets. ...1. Trump wants an isolationist United States.2. Trump doesn’t speak out against Assad in Syria, who Putin is helping.3. Trump wants to walk away from NATO, leaving Europe to Putin as far as influence goes.4. Trump owes millions to Russia in loans. Russia is heavily invested in Trump Enterprises.5. Paul Manafort, Trumps campaign manager worked as consultant to ex Ukranian President Viktor Yanukovych.6. Yanukovych was granted asylum from Putin after being driven from power in Ukraine.7. Manafort was hired to clean up Yanukovych’s image in Russia, just like he’s attempting to do with Trump.8. Trump’s tax returns would likely show his connections to and dependence on Russia and Putin.9. Trump refuses to produce his tax returns because “It will hurt my campaign”.10. And he illegally broke the Cuban embargo.11. His foundation was shut down for lack of certification and lack of audits. 12. There are charges pending on his Trump university scam. 13. There was a pending trial in NY for charges of raping a 13 year old. * it was dropped because she had been getting death threats, and was too terrified to show up.

The stability of Clinton's poll lead is unprecedented in modern political campaigns

1 | Judith Mike Cook | 652 | 1560516733968351_1560518290634862 | Hillary is funded by Big Money, Big Corporations, and foreign governments...she sold State Dept favors for contributions to the Clinton Foundation. She has a history of 30 years of lying and corruption, she has been under investigation dozens of times...she will sell out Americans and America in the blink of an eye and never lose a night's sleep...just like Benghazi!!
2 | Justine Lee | 249 | 1560516733968351_1560520950634596 | The FBI and the media set a new presidence after yesterday's announcement... if anyone gets into trouble "plead the Hillary Clinton FBI decision of November 6th 2016...
3 | Mary Maldonado | 320 | 1560516733968351_1560525417300816 | I really don't really like either candidate. They both have so much drama, but...she is better suited than he is. All he does and rant and rave like a child 👶🏻. It's rigged. It's rigged. Grow up Trump!
4 | Belinda Gibson | 222 | 1560516733968351_1560531493966875 | HOW??!! THERE is NO WAY!!!! DO YOU REALLY THINK WE, the  majority of THE PEOPLE IS THAT DUMB and easily FOOLED? Give it a break. I think you are forgetting about all the social media sources available today....hint hint.....it's proving you are LYING!!!!!
5 | Scott Partridge | 169 | 1560516733968351_1560553043964720 | .... as a Independent Voter this is the way I see it. After 30+ years in politics Hillary has a handful of celebrities backing her and the FBI looking into her affairs & foundation. Trump has the United States Military backing him along with the American Law Enforcement... Independent for Trump.!
6 | Bryan Mcdaniel | 203 | 1560516733968351_1560519627301395 | They are RIGGED, unless im ahead....Lol, says The Donald.
7 | Deborah Pilgrim | 77 | 1560516733968351_1560549147298443 | I don't understand how this is possible. You see the huge amount of people at Trump rallies and very few at Hillary's. It is obvious that the polls do not represent the American people.
8 | Dave Webb | 61 | 1560516733968351_1560547117298646 | NBC News is so bent on Hillary it's pathetic. If Hillary wins (and I pray to God she doesnt) .. I'll pray daily for our country because she is going to leave it in worse shape then it is now.
9 | Angie Perry | 69 | 1560516733968351_1560520853967939 | Not wanting one to enter office is fine, loathing their ideals, practices and character cool. Dont vote for them...But vile people who wish death on another person makes you a evil putrid scumbag, whose opinion means little to anyone the moment your evil thoughts passed through your lips.
10 | Onoja Emeka Celestine | 75 | 1560516733968351_1560522917301066 | Habaaah, this election is getting complicated. Just thinking about many things. what could be the negative effects if Clinton wins this election? How can safety be guaranteed under Hillary Clinton's administration? Are Americans safe? How can people vote for someone who has been investigated by FBI in the history of America? This election will be Rigged by Obama and co. watch out!!
11 | Paul Shipley | 80 | 1560516733968351_1560528813967143 | Trumps own campaign has to take his Twitter account off him because they don't trust him. Why would anybody trust him with leading the largest nation in the free world is beyond me. If you think that the most unqualified, ill tempered, con man who has ever stood for president is the man for the job you must believe in the Easter bunny as well
12 | Sue McCabe Van Cleave | 40 | 1560516733968351_1560524260634265 | Our country is in distress..Please use an upside down American flag as your header or as your profile picture to express your feelings about our corrupt government and their decisions. ... Half of our country knows whats up...and the other half are fools.I wanted to add, if Hillary wins on Tuesday(only b/c of fraud)In January when they swear her in, Millions of Americas should show up in Washington D. C. chanting "Lock her Up, Lock her Up" to make a statement.This action would be written in our History books forever.
13 | Kurt Knopp | 28 | 1560516733968351_1560576687295689 | NBC has consistently rigged their polls with a +11 to 12 Democrat advantage, for which there is no justification this election cycle.  It's been a statistical tie at best when you do an average of polls and a lot of polls are showing a Trump lead.  I'd be so embarrassed to be NBC right now, but they have no shame. They are just as bad as the corrupt CNN.
14 | Victor Hill | 80 | 1560516733968351_1560517523968272 | The only people voting for Hillary Clinton are people who hate America and easily manipulated, stupid people!
15 | Alessio Genovese | 30 | 1560516733968351_1560523287301029 | Having the banks funding your campaign is like having some help from the Devil. People that doesn't get this, will just believe wathever television will tell them
16 | Mai Tran | 38 | 1560516733968351_1560519467301411 | HRC is both lack of physical stamina and morality that is exactly a criminal that should not be allowed to be presidential candidate in any country !!!! Breaking : … Disturbing Truth About Scalia’s Death ! http://readconservatives.news/.../breaking-this-could.. DJT is the best choice for America at the present challenge, all Americans Vote Donald J. Trump to be 45th POTUS and God bless him all his ways to win this election !!! (Y)
17 | Dama Arauz | 23 | 1560516733968351_1560540323965992 | Don't be complacent and VOTE! Especially those of us in communities of color have to recognize we are the only people who can keep Trump, the predator racist out of the White House. White voters came out for Obama twice. We cant let it be said we only voted because Obama was black. We can't prove the bigots right. We cannot allow Obama's presidency to be de legitimized by the alt right who will be emboldened by a Trump win. We cannot let this epic misogynist be the example for our children.
18 | Rhonda Hart | 14 | 1560516733968351_1560525600634131 | When this election started, NBC supporters would rant rant and rant about trump supporters, now I don't see many rants at all NBC, you expect us peasants to believe your bs???
19 | Millan Sanchez | 22 | 1560516733968351_1560527663967258 | DEPORT THE SKANK: BREAKING NEWS- The AP is reporting Melania Trump worked in the US as an illegal. This violates immigration law making her ineligible for citizenship. Yes her citizenship will be revoked....
20 | Debi Skarecky-Hill | 8 | 1560516733968351_1154511307969810 | All the sad little Trump drones, mindlessly reciting exactly what their "leader" tells them to.  Use your brains...have an independent thought! It's not surprising that you were so easily conned by Trump.  Where's the outrage over him not releasing his tax returns?  My guess is he's the real criminal! Get real-it's not the Media or polls or all the women he assaulted that are lying...it's Trump!
21 | Americans Against Being A Lapdog For Israel | 13 | 1560516733968351_1560576237295734 | Hillary Clinton is a giant supporter of the government's disastrous and unconstitutional commitment to Israel. That commitment has cost the American people well over $6 trillion, thousands of American lives, puts the life of every man, woman, and child in the country at risk of terrorist attack; is a blatant violation of the Constitution's establishment clause, and constitutes the wholesale selling of the American people down the river for Israel. It's a virtual certainty that all of the aforementioned ramifications will continue unabated under Clinton and then some. Conclusion: This woman should be considered flat-right-out dangerous!
22 | Linda Eberhart | 7 | 1560516733968351_1590752304553096 | Look at the fine print at the end of the article. The survey was done by "NBC News|SurveyMonkey". Look at SurveyMonkey, where you can pay to set up your own survey and have it taken by a group of their members, who get rewards for taking the survey. You can choose "targeting options" for your repondents, which include political affiliation and voter status. Wouldn't be hard at all to rig a survey  to have the result you want. This survey is BS and there is a whole segment of the population who won't read past the headline. Talk about rigging the election with misleading headlines. Where I live there is nearly zero support for Hillary. That speaks much louder than these bogus surveys.
23 | Lyn Flynn | 8 | 1560516733968351_1560537720632919 | She's got this. Yay!!! This is exciting :) I'm such a feminist even though I always say I'm not a feminist lol. This is actually exciting and awesome :) it's gonna be cool to see :)
24 | Fern Yvette | 11 | 1560516733968351_1154551797965761 | The danger to America is not Hillary Clinton but a citizenry capable of entrusting her with the presidency. It will be easier to limit and undo the follies of another Clinton presidency than to restore the necessary common sense and good judgment to a depraved electorate willing to have such a woman linked to so much corruption and who is currently under FBI investigation for their president. The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Hillary, who is a mere symptom of what ails them. Hillary, princess of the fools, should not blind anyone to the vast confederacy of fools who wants to make her their princess. The republic can survive another Clinton who is, after all, merely a fool. It is less likely to survive a multitude of fools such as those who will make her their president.
25 | Jenny Shively Hoffbuhr | 5 | 1560516733968351_1590764951218498 | I used to love NBC. Until this election. They are so biased toward Clinton and have not in any way covered trump the same way they have covered hillary. They have lost my respect. They cover all the major trash that has come up on trump and only speak of Hillary with such mild discussion.  And of course they talk to trumps campaign manager and ask her questions cutting off constantly and never let her speak on anything. It's sickening.

BREAKING: Janet Reno has died from complications of Parkinson's disease.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sassan K. Darian | 510 | 1560486293971395_1560486487304709 | R.I.P. Janet Reno. She was the first female Attorney General. And we are less than a day away from having the first female President-elect as long as everyone goes out and votes and doesn't take the defeat of Donald Chump Trump for granted. Too bad she died a day early before the glass ceiling was shattered.Note to the right wing loons: David Koresh was responsible for the deaths at Waco including the rapes of the young girls/children that he had brainwashed along with their families. Now go bugger off somewhere else.
2 | Elvira Jefferson Clegg | 162 | 1560486293971395_1560512513968773 | Such a nice lady, my son worked under her for many years, got to meet her. I got to talk with her and one proud mom when she told me what a great job he was doing, and Attorney General Reno rest in peace.
3 | Jeff Hobbs | 118 | 1560486293971395_1560491037304254 | So... David Koresch burned all those kids, not Janet Reno. Wonder what would have happened if she had just left them alone? Another Clinton debacle. More to come...
4 | Ivan Daniel Beller | 103 | 1560486293971395_1560495267303831 | Today Janet Reno is reunited with all the women and children she rescued in Waco, Texas!And tomorrow, her old boss's wife, Hillary Clinton, will be given the green-light to rescue all the women and children in Syria!Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves!
5 | Christine Robie Kinsman | 99 | 1560486293971395_1560507310635960 | I know alot of people criticized her but she was willing to make a decision & take responsibility for it.
6 | Vicky Crump Eppenger | 75 | 1560486293971395_1560518483968176 | Odd I find it that so many people criticized the woman for being appointed by the Clinton Administration which all sitting Presidents have the right to do no matter what Party they are affilitated with. The woman had some difficult decisions to make and she made them. I guess these haters think they could have done a better job and moved the country forward instead of back 50 years!. Actually the haters probably would have not done anything because it is easier for them not to because if they had to think before they made a decision it would have been just devastating for them. RIP Janet Reno yes some of the decisions you made may not  not been approved by some at least you had the guts to do it instead of blaming others for their failings.
7 | Sheila Crawford Hayes | 87 | 1560486293971395_1560523970634294 | My mother, an older woman at the time, always wanted Janet Reno to get a different hair style. I would say, "Mother, she's the attorney general. I don't think she's worried about her hair!"A funny, fond memory. RIP to both ladies.
8 | Vernie Jefferies | 52 | 1560486293971395_1560549213965103 | My fondest memory of Janet is when she made the surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live on the Janet Reno Dance Party skit. That was a classic moment when she showed us a sense of humor at the end.
9 | David Martin | 62 | 1560486293971395_1560512973968727 | It's sad that Janet Reno passed away today, just one day before witnessing the election of the first female president of the United States of America!  Rest in Peace, Janet Reno!
10 | Rodney Foley | 17 | 1560486293971395_1560552500631441 | Well at least she didn't die in a firey inferno intrusion at the hands of the FBI and ATF directed by the Attorney General....
11 | Roslyn Ann Bauman | 10 | 1560486293971395_1560504597302898 | Sorry to hear this, I liked her alot , she actually was at a Girl Scout convention before I went because I remember  my friend Marty telling me about it. It is what got me interested in GS conventions!
12 | Dee Swain | 25 | 1560486293971395_1560537653966259 | She's just paving the way to hell for Killary. On this day we schould remember Elan Gonzolas and the trauma he was put through and all those poor babies she murdered in Waco. Yeah we know how those Democrats love children.smdh
13 | Leonie Spence Dawes | 8 | 1560486293971395_1560554757297882 | Oh dear, Rest in Peace Ms Janet Reno  my Prayers and thoughts are with your family, you pave the way for Hillary so Sorry you didn't get a chance to witness America's first Female P!resident sworn in!
14 | Pamela Lacombe Mullen | 11 | 1560486293971395_1560546557298702 | Janet, I wish you could have been here for the election results. Rest Janet , pray for our Country we are in for a bumpy ride.
15 | Sharon Peterson | 9 | 1560486293971395_1265390446835463 | So is voting for Hillary one of these, I'm voting for the first.....?  Never mind she has told so many lies, has had so many investigations into her dealings, should have been indicted and prosecuted for her illegal server, lying to the FBI and Congress about it, and so much more, BUT hey, I'm voting for the first woman President so it's all good!!  What a bunch of sheep!
16 | Lloyd Hart | 6 | 1560486293971395_1265404413500733 | Janet Reno is the person most responsible for all the death and destruction the US has inflicted on the world in the last 16 years with it's phony "War On Terror". As US Attorney General, she didn't lift a finger to investigate the theft of election 2000 and the subsequent suborning of the US Supreme Court by the Bush Campaign because the Clintons bribed and blackmailed her off the case. Janet Reno, coward to the grave.
17 | Jodi Meckle | 19 | 1560486293971395_1560491807304177 | Sad she didn't get to see the US have its first woman president :'(
18 | Stephanie Garcia | 9 | 1560486293971395_1560608343959190 | Hope she had a long talk with God before her last breath and asked for forgiveness for what she did in her life especially Waco!
19 | Maggie Taverner | 15 | 1560486293971395_1560491140637577 | Prayers to the Family.RIP attorney general Janet Reno.
20 | Hugh Cannon | 8 | 1560486293971395_1560615627291795 | I guess the right wing nutjobs will say Hillary killed her too because she knew the Clinton's secrets. RIP Ms Reno, you served your country well!

22 | Jennifer McCrary Wheeler | 5 | 1560486293971395_1265402220167619 | You all sure seem confident that Hilary is going to win it. I hope you all enjoy that decision once she's in and our country goes to hell in a hurry. You might want to rethink your vote on such a dishonest person.
23 | Brian T Roller | 2 | 1560486293971395_563435723847676 | Wasn't Janet Reno a leftist democrat, who was Bill Clinton's AG,  ordered the slaughter of 24 children and 46 men/women at Ruby Ridge, Waco TX ? God have mercy on her soul. Although Parkinsons is a terrible disease, it does NOT excuse her from terrible deeds.

5 | Dama Arauz | 247 | 1560464803973544_1560489150637776 | Donald Trump, you've shown us who you are. Trump isn't stable...we don't have time to be on the edge as a nation not knowing what to expect from our president. Whether Trump will be tweeting at 3am asking the nation to see a sex tape. Donald is not a stable person...will Trump be on his best behavior today? We are electing a president not a toddler.
6 | Naomi Lockwood | 129 | 1560464803973544_1560492757304082 | The only explanation I've heard that makes sense for the way Trump supporters never question his lies is that his movement has become a cult and his followers will drink whatever cool aid he hands them. We all heard the President say "let him speak" referring to the protestor.
7 | Brenda Reichert | 101 | 1560464803973544_1560551180631573 | So trump's crowd chanted, lock her up and trump called her obnoxious but Obama respects someone's first amendment rights points out we should respect that he was a vet and elderly and Obama takes heat from trump??? Trump isn't fit to carry Obamas sack lunch much less lead our country!!!
8 | Sherry Dunn | 126 | 1560464803973544_1560477223972302 | Why is Russia going hard for Trump? Why is it when you ask Trump a question, he deflects then brings up something Bill has done? Why does he condemn Bill for cheating and Malania was his side hoe?
9 | Anita Vassar | 76 | 1560464803973544_1560466380640053 | What can anyone expect from any American that would ever support clinton. Nothing trashier in all of America than a clintonite.
10 | David Williams | 54 | 1560464803973544_1560528890633802 | Bottom line, Trump lost so much money in one year he has avoided paying taxes for over a decade, how do you get "great" business man based on that?

13 | Matt Barton | 25 | 1560464803973544_1560538700632821 | Donald Trump left his billionaire lifestyle and entered the arena of politics not because he had to but because he is aware that this country is on the verge of falling. He signed up to have his life dissected and torn apart. He is fighting for the American people and win or lose I will always respect him for that. I already casted my vote for him and I pray that he wins and shows the world that they were wrong about all the evil things they said about him. That he will make America Great Again for ALL Americans.
14 | Brian Serwicki | 36 | 1560464803973544_1560490933970931 | "Hillary has the resilience that it takes to do this job. See, because when she gets knocked down, she doesn’t complain or cry foul. No, she gets right back up, and she comes back stronger for the people who need her the most. And here is what is also true—and I want you all to think about this: Hillary is one of the few people on this entire planet—and clearly the only person in this race—who has any idea what this job entails, who has seen it from every angle. Hear me: the staggering stakes, the brutal hours, the overwhelming stresses. And here's the thing—she still wants to take it on. See, because she believes that she has an obligation to use her talents to help as many people as possible. That is why she’s running."Now, let me tell you, that is what dedication looks like. That is what love of country looks like. So when I hear folks saying they don’t feel inspired in this election—well, let me tell you, I disagree. I am inspired. Because for eight years, I have had the privilege to see what it takes to actually do this job. And here’s what I absolutely know for sure: Right now, we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president. Hillary has been a lawyer, a law professor, First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the United States, a U.S. Senator, Secretary of State. That’s why I’m inspired by Hillary. I’m inspired by her persistence and her consistency, by her heart and her guts. And I’m inspired by her lifelong record of public service. No one in our lifetime has ever had as much experience and exposure to the presidency—not Barack; not Bill. And, yes, happens to be a woman.  "So we cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative. Because here is what we know—that being president isn’t anything like reality TV. It’s not about sending insulting tweets or making fiery speeches. It’s about whether or not the candidate can handle the awesome responsibility of leading this country. So, ask yourselves: Which candidate really has the experience, the maturity, and the demeanor to handle the job I described to you? Which candidate’s words and actions speak to the future we want for our country and the values we share—values like inclusion and opportunity, service and sacrifice for others?" —First Lady Michelle Obama
15 | Christine Riebe | 15 | 1560464803973544_693166177506354 | Trump hasn't learned how NOT to lie. My fave is how he claims Obama "screamed" at a Trump supporter over the weekend. Watch the video...Obama stood up for the guy lol ....perception is everything. Can't wait until the orange one goes back under his rock....ugh!
16 | Deb Talaber | 11 | 1560464803973544_1560592570627434 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been stomped.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

18 | Mary Ann Bailey | 18 | 1560464803973544_1560512753968749 | Good Lord, People stop putting each other on trial. Nobody owes anyone explanation or proof of anything. Stop being a bunch of arrogant, obnoxious bullies and respect each other's opinions . If you can't do that, just scroll and go. Truth is: none of the candidates  can be classified as perfect.
19 | Teresa Charlene Roberts Oliver | 12 | 1560464803973544_1560513140635377 | I just don't see how anyone can say this country has moved forward in the past 8 years! We have fallen back with all the racial uproar that has been going on for at least 3 years now! Until 8 years ago we as Americans had moved past color and gender division! But now we live in a time where all that is being torn apart by those who hold power! Goverment, MSM, DNC, etc has used these issues that had died along time ago and used it to rip this country apart! I'm so sick of the BS that has been started by those who want to finish off this once great country called USA! WE AS A NATION  have let those that hold power bring us to our knees and turn on each other! When was the last time you had something nice to say to someone whom doesn't share your views! When was the last time you helped your neighbors that don't see things your way!  You need to look in your mirror and ask yourself, is this the person I was 2,4,8 years ago? Did I have this much hate in my heart before all this mess started? A country can only be conquered when it's divided! And I hate to say this and never thought I would but we are so divided that we are ripe for conquering! The fall of this country will be determined come tomorrow night and I HOPE AND PRAY we are not conquered!
20 | Amber Marie | 5 | 1560464803973544_1560557530630938 | So do you remember when you yourself lied to Tue American people about health care : if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. And health care cost will go down . you Obama did not even try to be sneaky about it you just flat out lied to the American people . so stfu about Trump . he actually wants American to be put 1st
21 | David Barnes | 10 | 1560464803973544_1560478293972195 | What neither candidate has addressed is the growing entitlement problem. Social security is growing at a rate that places a burden on our youth they may not  and should not bear. What is the answer? Each candidate must face this issue.
22 | Kandi Rehma | 18 | 1560464803973544_1815557475395657 | PASS THIS AROUND IT GIVES HEART FELT INSIGHT.Will A Kelly WROTE : Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months, I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process, you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr. Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!MR. TRUMP

It's such a great idea...I mean, who knew we could break up the gases under the earth and use our drinking water to do so, making it unusable, and thus forcing people to by bottled water... All for fuel and energy.Man, it's almost, like... It's like we don't have any wind or direct sun light... If only we had something like that to protect with military hardware... Hmmm I wonder, ...
2 | Christopher Nau | 108 | 1560371990649492_1560373003982724 | Another reason why fracking is a terrible idea.
3 | Kerrie Harlin | 52 | 1560371990649492_1560376473982377 | Meanwhile our dear old governor sanctioned an official day of prayer for the success of the oil and gas industry. At first only Christians were to pray then she back tracked and included all faiths. This all after she was forced to admit that fracking was causing the earthquakes.
4 | Robert Rodel | 46 | 1560371990649492_1560378087315549 | Geologists have explained why fracking in the Oklahoma area causes earth quakes. We have to at some point relize these areas canot with stand the damaged fracking causes
5 | Dean Caldwell | 40 | 1560371990649492_1560404930646198 | Go ahead Oklahoma, Frack some more! Isn't Oklahoma the state whose Senator came out on the floor and had a snow ball and proclaimed there is no global warming?
6 | Crystal Dupree | 31 | 1560371990649492_1560375010649190 | Oil companies destroyed Oklahoma, we feel those Oklahoma quakes in Kansas two or three times a month.
7 | Jodie Patterson | 11 | 1560371990649492_1560577497295608 | I can't believe republican American citizens have been brainwashed to the point they don't care if thier entire state splits into, if a huge earthquake comes and most homes fall apart oh well.  Its like it doesn't matter as long as they support what the  republican politicians want.  It's outrageous they can't remember when they were kids OK had no earthquakes, now they do and they can't seem to put 2 and 2 together that fracking is harming the earth.
8 | Karen Selberg Thorson | 10 | 1560371990649492_1560382250648466 | Let's get a map of FAULT lines through Oklahoma and you might see a problem. Mother Nature created those- can't say fracking did not add to it but Oklahoma is heavy in fault lines.
9 | Marie Logston | 15 | 1560371990649492_1560413260645365 | Ive always thought earthquakes and Huge Sinkholes were caused by fracking..But mostly Republicans dont believe fracking harms anything and they don't believe in Global Warming..As their Trump says on his commercial, Its called Weather People...Boy is he smart lol...We need someone with his smarts for President lol...Hillary 11-08-2016.

10 | John Tsangaris | 13 | 1560371990649492_1560429777310380 | Keep fraking, it's harmless! 😵 Republicans don't believe the data supporting global warming either. Morons have no right to complain.
11 | Daniel Gormley | 11 | 1560371990649492_1560397040646987 | One day, probably soon, one of these increasingly large fracquakes is going to break open that giant oil storage facility. The resulting explosions will be seen from many miles away. No one in Cushing will see it though, or rather it will be the last instant they see anything. It's all right though, because the Koch brothers will keep getting paid right up till the end.

For those people screaming at the O&G industry -- what are you doing to eliminate your dependence on O&G?  People are wondering why our Gov (who I dislike) called for praying for oil -- because 100s of thousands of incomes are from working directly or indirectly for O&G.  WHAT is the ANSWER?? I wish someone would figure it out.   I personally think it is from the natural fault lines, drilling AND our recent drought.
14 | Molly Torres | 1 | 1560371990649492_1560687300617961 | I'm wondering what the people of Oklahoma feel about this? Are you angry about the fracking? Are you worried about the future of your state? Or are you willing to trade your safety for the profits of the oil companies?
15 | Sarah Berry | 4 | 1560371990649492_1560379993982025 | Fracking does not case earthquakes. Good god. The earths plates are thousands of miles below the surface, fracking is done about about 300-500 feet...... A U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geophysicist debunked claims by environmentalists that hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, causes damaging earthquakes. ... The region's earthquakes aren't due to fracking,
16 | Michael Farmer | 5 | 1560371990649492_1560538447299513 | Hope they are enjoying their oil. Surely the oil companies will pay for the damage right? Nope. Oklahoma's bought off government made it illegal to sue the oil companies for the damage they do to your home.

These earthquakes are getting bigger and bigger and more often. The one on November 2 I believe they said was 5.8 and felt in 7 states!!! The one last night felt in 4 states. Idk if it's fracking or what, but look into it. Just say in.

20 | Thomas Bryan | 4 | 1560371990649492_1560493133970711 | Funny to see all that rants in here against those darned ol' Republicans. Fracking has grown by 400% under obama.

25 | Judith Balzer | 0 | 1560371990649492_1561087887244569 | This fracking situation seems to be caused by the reintegration of the water removed to reach the crappy oil. Why is this brine not pumped out and used for its own value. Natural brine has numerous applications, is natural and might prevent further damage to the state.

If you’d like to continue the destruction of our manufacturing base, and the jobs that went with it. If you like the uncontrollable immigration, if you like the string of stupid wars from Iraq to Libya to Syria. If you want to say yes to all of that, if you want to keep this all the way it is, fine, then vote for Hillary Clinton. If you don’t like the way things are headed you got a chance to really shake the system the system at its roots. If you wake up on Election Day and it’s the same as it is today, if its the same 4 or 5 or 8 years from now, remember you had a chance really change it up but you were to dainty to do it.
9 | Larry DeFilippis | 39 | 1560358420650849_1560372080649483 | Even if she wins, tens of millions will never support a criminal in the Whitehouse. We the People will never allow ourselves to be governed by an illegitimate president.  Clinton will be unable to build bridges among those who believe she should be in prison instead of the Oval Office.  The first time she uses Executive privilege or violates her duty to carry out the laws of this country or her obligation under the constitution, all hell will break loose.  That glass ceiling she shatters may come showering down upon her.  Those who elect her are complicit in her treachery and patriots of this country won't soon forget!
10 | Sonya Boyd Collier | 53 | 1560358420650849_1560365133983511 | You can't unify a country by making people give up their freedom to please another group of people!! You can only unify people by treating each person equal rather they have the same beliefs or not!! Those who want to take away others rights are the ones dividing this country and they want to be treated as superior not equal!!
11 | Rob Maynard | 22 | 1560358420650849_1560366537316704 | But what do you do if she's indicted for Violation of the RICO act? Clinton Foundation is still under investigation.What do you do if she's impeached? There's more than enough evidence to impeach her at this point.
12 | Wendy Boyer | 31 | 1560358420650849_1560367390649952 | Premature doncha think NBC? Election hasn't ended yet. Hillary will never be my president or voice. Sorry. I don't let women speak on my behalf when they support a sexual predator, rapist, or a man who commita adultery on her. Nor do i support a woman who was proud to march against the blacks movement for equality,  or who is against gay rights and proudly advocated this in several interviews over the last 30 years. I do not support a woman who risks our nations security and uses "i dont recall" as her best defense in court. I do not support a woman who lies under oath. (Watch the trial and listen to the questions asked, Comey stated on the record Hilary had lied). I do not support a woman who has been investigated by the fbi time and time again, who stole thousands of dollars in furniture from the white house (who does that? Did she think it was a divorce split of belongings?)... i do not support a woman who believes in abortion up to 36 weeks. (If a pregnant woman is murdered, its considered a double homicide so please enlighten me, how do you claim no life in the womb based on that law?). . I do not support a woman who calls women deplorable or idiots. She literally says she speaks for all women so, uh, guess integrity and respect aren't too high on her morals?The nation will crumble under her administration. You think its rough now, this is a smooth ride in comparison to what it will be.

15 | Andrew Buck | 14 | 1560358420650849_1560410353978989 | Hillary takes tens of millions from middle eastern countries that kill/beat women and gays by government decree, not to mention her foundation robbed Haiti of hundreds of millions after the earthquake which resulted in thousands of poor black Haitians dying! THIS DEMOCRAT will be voting for JILL STEIN.
16 | Shawna Holly | 2 | 1560358420650849_1098490016939087 | It won't work. Too many people are so completely anti-Hillary that there's just no bringing them around. And too many people are so pro-Trump that there's no bringing them around either. The rift between Democrats and Republicans is just too great. The most likely way to get Washington functioning again would be to elect a neutral third party who has no vested interest in either side; someone who will bring in the best from both parties and from the moderate center.
17 | Mike L King | 31 | 1560358420650849_1560364220650269 | Women who vote for hillary Do NOT have very high moral and ethical standards about the first female presidents. I mean if a woman can cast a vote for hillary, then that woman has zero integrity.

20 | Nancy Bartle | 2 | 1560358420650849_1098546906933398 | what a pile of garbage nbc, HRC is going to bring together the divided country, but wait Obama has done so much to bring the county together, come on, according to the media what has this guy done wrong.You can't have it both ways, everything about Obama is the best and then out the other side of their tripe, we need Hillary to save from the diaster our country has become. I would hope my fellow americans would catch on how dumb they really think you are

22 | Tim Banes | 3 | 1560358420650849_1560373270649364 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016
23 | Fern Yvette | 2 | 1560358420650849_1098561676931921 | Between extremely biased "news" and an education system that denigrates American culture and our traditional values of freedom, individual responsibility and property ownership rights, while it praises multiculturalism, ridicules traditional American values, and glorifies socialism, it is no wonder the U.S. electorate are incapable of making intelligent decisions at election time.
24 | Phyllis Howard | 12 | 1560358420650849_1560381637315194 | We will have to be very supportive of her as our first woman President as there as Congress is mostly male.  Hopefully we will elect enough Democrats to Congress to take the obstructionist GOP edge off.
25 | Jo-Ann St Andre Sabbagh | 1 | 1560358420650849_887272368040652 | Sorry, honey. You can't call people who aren't supporting you "deplorable" one minute and expect all to be forgiven the next. It's still a free country and we should be able to support any candidate we choose without you stamping your foot and calling us names.
