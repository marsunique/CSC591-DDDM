"She should give that money back." 

Donald J. Trump said Hillary Clinton should return money given to the Clinton Foundation from Middle Eastern countries that oppress women, adding that when he's elected "we're going to drain the swamp of Washington, DC."

1 | Joseph J Martin | 10154719866501336_10154720027946336 | In defense of Donald Trump : Try to keep this in mind, Donald Trump did not steal your money. Donald Trump did not raise your taxes. Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food. Trump is not stirring a race war. Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims. Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda. Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East. Trump did not betray Israel. Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. Trump did not cripple our economy. Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars. Trump did not ruin our credit, twice. Trump did not double African American unemployment. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans. Trump did not set free all of terrorists in Guantanamo bay. Trump did not steal your rights, violate US Constitutional law, or commit treason, hundreds of times. Yet Trump is being ripped apart in the news, non stop. Barrack Hussein Obama, Hillary Clinton and the criminals occupying our government, are not. The media is the Democratic Party. Save our culture.
2 | Sue Carpenter Sheerer | 10154719866501336_10154720028626336 | Hillary is a SCAM.. it's not too late, before she scams you out of your Social Security.. think.. think.. O'Bummers economic plan, which she plans to follow, is the worst in presidential history. Our National Deficit DOUBLED to 20 TRILLION in the last 8 years, and our GNP is the lowest since the depression at only 1%. Even the DNC commissioner Donna admitted that WE ARE DOOMED in today's WIKI leaks. THINK about your future. The economy is being artificially stimulated with low interest rates, which has only enabled foreign companies to buy American STOCKS!!! They will soon own our corporations that we have built. WAKE UP!!!! Stop supporting politicians that only care about THEIR economic agenda, and worry about your own. TRUMP FOR A CHANGE!!!!!
3 | Wes Stutzman | 10154719866501336_10154720030811336 | Good ol Corrupt Hillary, yet people want to vote for her. So ignorant.
4 | Corina Rivera | 10154719866501336_10154720035956336 | If you vote for Hillary then you are voting for Globalism which means open borders and no tariffs on imports. This makes it attractive for corporations to invest on cheap capital and cheap labor overseas. This sends the jobs that people depended on right out of this country. Not to mention the open borders for foreign companies to compete in our domestic market driving small businesses out of business. Corporations love Globalism and Regional Trade Agreements because it makes their profits sky rocket. Hillary supports Globalism and the corporations love her for it. Don't vote for Hillary if you are in favor of Protectionism and against more globalism.
5 | Kristi Long Beach | 10154719866501336_10154720032886336 | I loved it when he made this statement...it sure shut her up...she had nothing to say...as usual, when he's backed her into a corner!!! She shouldn't be accepting millions of dollars from countries who don't uphold what she SAYS she stands for!!!
6 | Nic Dsouza | 10154719866501336_10154720043216336 | I think it is high time Trump needs to insert Melania and Ivanka into his campaign and they do some rallies as well to win over the women voters and take on the hypocritical Michelle Obama.
7 | Robbie Sumblin Thomas | 10154719866501336_10154720056811336 | Say what you will about Donald J. Trump. ..I just watched the Al Smith dinner on Fox..this Man Does NOT Waiver or Compromise on issues this nation holds in high regard, regardless of the situation, social or otherwise. For this Alone I respect him and stand firm in my decision to stand United with him in his vision, for the fight for truth, freedom and the pursuit of the American Dream for every American.
8 | TerriAnn Clidence Arrington | 10154719866501336_10154720043316336 | I sure hope so, Mr Donald J. Trump!! I see it and you are right corruption is all over Washington.The house and the Senate are afraid of you. You will actually make them work for us. (Not everyone is lazy and crooked, for example Trey Gowdy isn't.) Thank's for telling it like it is.
9 | Carol Creason | 10154719866501336_10154720043116336 | You people need to take a long hard look at Hillary.... I can't believe anyone would  vote for such a liar....wake the hell up.... Good Lord   !!!
10 | Johnny Renzulli | 10154719866501336_10154720055816336 | Lies/corruption/fraud/dead people etc. You get the picture. The Woman shouldn't even be running for the highest position in the land she should be in jail! How do people not see this? Worse, how can they support her??
11 | Anthony Rundberg | 10154719866501336_10154720041996336 | Trump got a point. Clinton took a lot of money from countries that don't share the view of so many voters over gays and transgenders and transexuals. Fact is a lot of these countries would gladly execute these people and not even have a second thought about it. Hillary takes their money. Speaks volumes about how LOW she is willing and able to go. She stands for them? She defends them? Hmmmm...
12 | Harley Kesselman | 10154719866501336_10154720061026336 | Hillary Clinton: "I support LGBT rights and I am a strongest advocate for women and justice worldwide!"Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Morocco: "Here are tens of millions of dollars, Hillary!"Hillary Clinton: "What did I just say? I forgot, so just give me your money!"
13 | Rick Paquette | 10154719866501336_10154720049196336 | Just as soon as the Donald gives back the money to those who went to his fake university. Maybe pay all the contractors he stiffed. How about paying back workers, banks and stockholders who lost on your bankruptcies.
14 | Robert Crisco Striblen | 10154719866501336_10154720069166336 | Oh yeah and it aint cheap killing everyone the ever investigated her corruption and lies, the list is long and many of them were employees or contractors for the Clinton Foundation.
15 | Penny Volosin | 10154719866501336_10154720065106336 | Glad people are finally waking up! Here is a good read that's to the point."Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn’t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, “Trump is arrogant.” My friend questioned if one man could make “that much difference in the world today.” To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, “Really, what has Trump done?”I said, “In June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.”As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ”At this point, what do you have to lose?” We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year—one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I’ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we’re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That’s your right. Just don’t ever say he’s not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh’s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise … and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase—they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America’s problem isn’t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it’s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they’re not simply the “silent majority” as you’ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them “deplorables.” The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year." From Be Forbes."Bebe Coe Bertino9/29/2016 , this is a copy and paste, and needs to be read and spread!!
16 | Beth Busiek | 10154719866501336_10154720085661336 | Donald J. Trump is right, she's a hypocrite if she doesn't give it back.  The left all cried 'divest' when South Africa was segregated, but as long as the Saudis are greasing their palms the left will turn a blind eye
17 | Suzanne Poland | 10154719866501336_10154720092171336 | To my fellow women voters, we can do better. Hillary Clinton represents the worst of us, not the best. The first female president of this country should be an exceptional woman, not a liar or a greedy elitist, not controversial or divisive. She should espouse the virtues of all of us, the fact that we are so divided about her should speak volumes. When the right woman runs for president, we will be united.
18 | Nicole Radcliff | 10154719866501336_10154720093131336 | If any of you plan on voting for Hillary Clinton, I HIGHLY recommend you watch "Hillary's America". This video shows the truth behind democracy in America and what it has actually stood for rather than what we have been brainwashed to believe, while shedding light on who the Clintons really are. You may be able to convince people to vote for you and support your causes today Hillary, but you are who you are now because of what you have done to get here. Facts are facts and this video reveals ALL of the facts. A little highlight on what the video reveals about Hillary: Benghazi, Haiti scam, her support for a highly known female figure who started the movement for planned parenthood which was created on a racist basis, her support for rapists and her strong defense against them to include her husband, and sooo so much more. I don't dislike her because she is ignorant and I disagree with her way of doing things, I dislike her because she is a liar and can't keep her stories straight. She is inconsistent with her views leading the citizens of this nation to believe one thing while she intends to do the complete opposite. Don't vote as an uninformed, politically uneducated citizen. Vote with sense as this is the most crucial presidential election of Americas history.
19 | Ron Keas | 10154719866501336_10154720064551336 | They are acting like she GAVE the Saudis money instead of receiving it.  If she can get a bad country to donate money to a charity that saves lives, what's the problem?  Would a Church refuse money from a sinner?
20 | Dotty McPherson | 10154719866501336_10154720087561336 | Hillary’s accusations that the Russians will interfere with the election for the Republicans is a ruse. The Russian Uranium Deal in which she was involved probably was payment for the Russians to help Hillary win the election. Don't be fooled by Crooked Hillary and Obama, and the corrupt Obama Administration and Democrat Party.
21 | John Nunes | 10154719866501336_10154720076376336 | I have said this before Mr Trump does not have to deal with the sympathy vote that President Obama got, we can all see that Mr. Trump is the best qualified to take the Helm of this great nation indeed the world in this new era, with strength respect and Common Sense God bless Donald Trump !
22 | Rosemary Gettie Waldron | 10154719866501336_10154720095941336 | How quickly we forget!  If you’re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane—you won’t believe what you have forgotten.  If you’re under 35, read on—I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn’t a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
23 | Jackie Rawlings | 10154719866501336_10154720034526336 | interesting comment as Donald has always done business with the Saudis and Iran yet I guess because he never learned raping, gropping and sexual assault is a crime so I guess we just wont talk about that.
24 | Andrea Grubb | 10154719866501336_10154720045656336 | Trump you should give back that money you spent from your foundation to pay your legal fees from all these people who are suing you from the Trump University. You all wont mentioned that.
25 | Andi Larson | 10154719866501336_10154720066741336 | It would be nice to think there wouldn't be anymore corruption, but just getting rid of the rotten clinton crime family is a big start. Hillary said she would put a stop to anyone else getting money from terrorist nations after the election. That should tell us all how corrupt she is.

"They basically showed us their character, which is what we thought it was at the beginning – untrustworthy, unfit in some cases, cynical, etcetera." 

Charles Krauthammer weighed in on the presidential candidates, saying "this has been one of the worst years  for American democracy in general."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jason Martinez | 10154719887831336_10154719942431336 | Lost all respect for Kelly and Charles. It's simple Charles Krauthammer, it's either Hilary or Trump and is CANT be Kilary.
2 | Rick Neuendorf | 10154719887831336_10154719943156336 | Obviously Krauthammer supports hillary. he is voting for someone other than Trump or HIllary, He must not care about the supreme court cause a vote for anyone other than Trump IS a vote for hillary. He knows that but does not care.
3 | Roy Spanberger | 10154719887831336_10154719944151336 | America is not a democracy and Krauthhammer couldn't be more wrong. Trump is trying to save America while Hillary is trying to destroy it.
4 | Chris Hulse | 10154719887831336_10154719941656336 | Shut up boy you were wrong for years ago you were wrong eight years ago you're just a windbag go back to your job and leave us Americans alone

6 | Theo Klene | 10154719887831336_10154719943916336 | Look Hillary and the Democrats are sooo corrupt , you'd have to be mad not to vote for Trump to put an end to it , as much as you might em like his language and tone and no P C at least he says and does what he says. I use to think Krauthammer was Americas smartest man .... No longer
7 | Joseph J Martin | 10154719887831336_10154719941116336 | She avoided a lot of the questions by answering with something that sounds smart but doesn't actually answer the question.  30 years of experience and some people still buy her bs. She could cook a live puppy in boiling water and some people would still come back with "oh, well Donald Trump is racist etc.
8 | Jeremy Moore | 10154719887831336_10154719944111336 | Problem with Dr. Krauthammer's theory is that the gop voters wanted trump because they were tired of the candidates being picked by the big money donors and elites. The democrats clearly wanted someone other than hillary and the establishment pushed hillary
9 | Jeffrey Simoni | 10154719887831336_10154719943841336 | I bet this guy has never listened to a full Trump speech at one of his rallies. This guy is an idiot. You have to love the DonDon!!
10 | Ron Watson | 10154719887831336_10154719969076336 | Charles, this country needed a change, and the peoplechose Trump. So--get off your high Elitest Horse, and accept it. The original patriots who fought for this country's independence, most had never been to school--but, they knew exactly what they were doing.
11 | Joey Vman | 10154719887831336_10154719956171336 | Charles you are smart but give it a rest will ya. The republicans had 19 people run. The people have spoken they wanted Trump. Say what you want but Trump has brought to the attention of Millions just how corrupt politics really is
12 | Debbie Doyle Haywood | 10154719887831336_10154719972201336 | I used to respect Charles opinion but no longer and am bitterly dissapointed by so many not realizing the bigger picture.  I do feel if Hillary is elected America as we once knew it is over.  God help us!
13 | Nruth Toms | 10154719887831336_10154719953871336 | Charles, that is ridiculous. Ronald Reagan invoked real hatred from the democrats and republicans also. There is a huge difference in the ideology of Repubicans and Democrats. RINO's not so much.
14 | James R Moore | 10154719887831336_10154719955241336 | Lets face it neither candidate is our first choice but when you look at policy and what is best for America it isn’t even close. I overwhelmingly support Trump’s policies and believe that Clinton’s policies will seriously damage the nation, perhaps forever. On the Supreme Court, abortion, religious liberty, sexual orientation regulations, taxes, economic growth, the minimum wage, school choice, Obamacare, protection from terrorists, immigration, the military, energy, and safety in our cities, I think Trump’s  policies are far better than Clinton’s. Now I am much more concerned with what Clinton has done in her 30 years of so called public service, (which was truly for her own selfish reasons), than what Trump said years ago.
15 | Louise Jarels Mattox | 10154719887831336_10154720012626336 | I have no confidence at all in Megyn Kelly and now I have none in Charles Krauthammer just talking heads, Fox News has gone down hill, they are showing just how liberal they are, just a couple now that I can watch, Greata did a wonderful job, and I miss her😢I bring on Michael Savage!!!

17 | Donna Barrett | 10154719887831336_10154720026416336 | Everyone is complaining that Trump is "unprofessional", Trump is "rude" not presidential , etc. etc.....Well my fellow Americans....we got into this MESS by experienced distinguished speaking, conniving liars, who have been stealing OUR tax dollars to do with as they please, for their agenda, not ours.  I don't WANT another sweet talkin liar....we need someone like Trump who is not politically experienced in their mob style gang to scam Americans!!  I'm tired of those refined politicians with that smile on their faces, spewing lies from their lips while stabbing  us in the back!!!
18 | Tim Kennedy | 10154719887831336_10154719955666336 | The political machine needs to have a total melt down and rebuild. The democrats have been able to push it further to the left year after year. When we have a system within a system that has its own rules with no prosecution in time it will fail and that time is now. Trump is capitalizing on the opportunity and opening new doors.
19 | Arlene Re Crist | 10154719887831336_10154719986486336 | A vote for anyone but Trump will give us Hillary. God help us all if she wins because our country will never be the same. She will destroy us with no checks and balances in the Supreme Court.
20 | Sandra Hronec Cherry | 10154719887831336_10154719946791336 | Keep your vote to yourself... now you have told us all you are wasting your vote... and you are suppose to be this brilliant man.. I think is mighty stupid to write in your vote.
21 | Holly Walker | 10154719887831336_10154719964036336 | Krauthammer is obviously not as bright as I thought. His announcement tonight shows poor judgement . You've got to stand for something... Vote for the least vile---- but at least make a choice. Go Trump😃
22 | Ron Dyball | 10154719887831336_10154719947021336 | I watched some of the O'Reilly and then when  Kelly came on I shut it offBut  I'm going to stop watching Fox news all together
23 | Doreen Appugliese Piro | 10154719887831336_10154719973041336 | Krauthammer! I really though you would swing Trump! You are just as ignorant as the others that want to write a name in!!For that matter your all just better off staying home!! But they will all complain if HILLARY gets in and start her reign of terror Your all ignorant all about yourselves
24 | Alex Goolman | 10154719887831336_10154720018736336 | Charles Krauthammer should quit. He is boring and typically off on his review of events. You make me want to break my tv when I hear your voice.
25 | Tonya Roberts | 10154719887831336_10154719961591336 | Ive saw a bunch of basement dwellers also Marc Fernandez. You know, the ones Hillary screwed out of a good candidate when she sh*t Bernie out of the nomination? Theres also been quite a few of Hillarys  needy latinos commenting today to. You act like Trump supporters are the only ones shes talked trash about when in fact, shes talked trash about 95% of the ones commenting. So before u talk trash to the deplorables u can take ur needy @ss back to your basement corner and think about it!!!

"This picture captures the face of a mother who saw her child, who she can't hug, wash, dress, snuggle and touch freely lay on his new Service dog of his own free will, with a purposeful unspoken attachment," the boy's mom wrote.

1 | Laura Westerfield | 10154718657571336_10154719896641336 | Mom shouldn't feel bad. I think these kids instinctively know that their dog expects nothing. To the dog the simple act of laying upon it is evidence of forever love. So the dog gives back by simply being. The child must sense this as well. I cry for the parents.. I laugh with the child and his or her new found sense of complete accepting. God bless them all. Dogs are really the best thing God created.. That is why it's God backwards. Dog. <3
2 | Chuck Heumader | 10154718657571336_10154719877456336 | Dog's are God's ambassadors.
3 | Chrys Bean | 10154718657571336_10154719934621336 | I don't think the mom looks like she feels bad - I think she is completely overwhelmed with the JOY OF THIS - tears of joy and gratitude that this child bonded with the dog immediately.  What a beautiful thing we are seeing here.
4 | Mary Carberry Tyre | 10154718657571336_10154719888186336 | DOG SPELLED BACKWARDS SPELLS GOD. DOGS ARE COMFORTING. THEY CAN SENSE WHAT A CHILD OR PERSON NEEDS.
5 | Pamela Kilgore Erickson | 10154718657571336_10154719982701336 | My 47 year old son who now lives with us and who has stage 4 cancer and may only have a few more months on this earth found a dog a little over a year ago. She is his joy...and is always there for him at his lowest points....thru all the horrible effects of chemo and all he good days. This young boy has the best friend in the world...ans they will be best friends for a very, long, long time. The joy this mother feels is heartwarming ... and has a beautiful son. God bless them all!
6 | Ellen Holtz | 10154718657571336_10154719916316336 | Dogs have an inner sense of what, we, as humans need for emotional  health and support.....I am convinced of this!!!!   I have a 12 yr. old pup and when I am sad and go to bed with tears, she lays closer and licks away those tears!!  These are God's gift to humans, unconditional love and we should never, ever take that for granted!
7 | Christine Nowak Mat | 10154718657571336_10154719908566336 | This is so beautiful! Dogs bring so much joy and peace to adults and children. They live to please and unconditionally love their human companions/owners. I don't have an autistic child, but I am a Mom and I would do anything to help my kids. This Mom sees that her Son is comforted and it brings tears to her eyes. Very emotional for this Mom and I hope that this Boy and dog develop a beautiful friendship.
8 | Judi Wirtjes | 10154718657571336_10154719966871336 | I am so grateful for the amazing people training these dogs. What a huge and amazing thing for these isolated children to be able to bond, to trust, to feel totally safe in the company of another being. Thank you God for dogs.
9 | Nancy Collins | 10154718657571336_10154720005681336 | My heart breaks for Mom as she clearly loves her son with all her heart and soul. At the same time, I rejoice in the connection between dog and son. There is NO greater connection when autism is involved. Dogs provide something to disabled people that we humans can't conceive. It is God's way of bringing love.
10 | Jenny Canfield | 10154718657571336_10154720025246336 | This is wonderful. I read an article in a magazine years ago about a little girl with autism. She had many issues including not speaking so her mother took her to this place to try a new experimental therapy which consisted of a therapist playing the child classical music. After a little while they returned the girl to her mother and the mother stated she was a different child. After just a short time with the music the little girl began to speak.
11 | Sherry Edlin | 10154718657571336_10154719983036336 | Mom spelled backwards is mom,and that was beautiful Laura Westfield,I am also a Grandmother of an Autistic boy,he is my world,and I'm a Dog lover as well..couldn't have said it better
12 | Cara Long | 10154718657571336_10154720093006336 | The amount of disgusting, irrelevant comments on this are just plain sad. This has nothing to do with who anyone supports politically, it has nothing to do with the kid being misbehaved (which a lot of people seem to think when they see kids with various "disabilities" and they don't understand them), it doesn't even have anything to do with pushing for or against vaccines. It's simply a heart warming story. Yet people have to try and make it into some sort of argument over something dumb. GROW UP!
13 | Linda Moodie | 10154718657571336_10154720009196336 | 4 paws for ability is an amazing group, and I'm so glad this woman shared her experience that she had through them. I'm currently in the university foster program through 4 paws and I'm so blessed to be a part of it. I can't wait to see the dog we are fostering go off to help someone who needs him. It'll make giving him up worth it!
14 | Behare Zweig | 10154718657571336_10154720000236336 | I feel so sad for the mom! Someone said that God doesn't through things your way if he knew you couldn't handle! You are a wonderful mom and god knows you have a wonderful son! I know how lucky most of us are to be able to share our emotions with our children.
15 | Sherry Martin | 10154718657571336_10154719935611336 | Dogs have such an instinct and service to those who cannot respond.. how anyone can be mean to an animal is beyond me ... and it goes further than dogs, all animals have that instinct ... even birds and chickens ... just watch and it will make your heart soar!!
16 | Andres Penuela | 10154718657571336_10154719892961336 | My Colombian parents would know how to make autism go away... Specially if I wouldn't shower or bathe... And it would hurt.
17 | Elizabeth Lloyd | 10154718657571336_10154720047791336 | That is a mother consumed with joy ❤️ God bless her and this beautiful little boy. A lovely bond between a boy and his dog.
18 | Margie Gerrish | 10154718657571336_10154720032791336 | I wish he'd been able to have a service dog when he was even younger.  Guess they'll need to do lots of special things together to make up for lost time.
19 | Carolina Andrea Davies | 10154718657571336_10154719931531336 | 4 Paws for Ability dogs ROCK so much we have two. It's amazing to see these instant bonds in person. I love how this story has been seen around the world.
20 | John Waters | 10154718657571336_10154719891846336 | This is very inspiring to see I sincerely hope that this is a transformation for this boy and his personal relationships
21 | Derek Leslie | 10154718657571336_10154719888556336 | maybe the boy isnt "autistic" ... maybe autistic is a positive label..... maybe hes so advanced he realizes we shouldnt hug our moms or dads... hes focusing on older women and cute animals
22 | Urslan Hayat | 10154718657571336_10154719899956336 | It is a touching story that an autistic kid bonded with a service dog, but let us not forget there is nothing touching about Pharma vaccines and especially MMR Vaccine causing nerve damage and Autism!
23 | Carol Stark Oaks | 10154718657571336_10154719890181336 | How can anyone make a sensible comment about this unless that person has an autistic child..
24 | Mark Walker | 10154718657571336_10154719908636336 | My thoughts and prayers with this amazing family!  It's amazing what animals can do for autistic children.
25 | Angie Laird | 10154718657571336_10154719924191336 | Hang in there Mom! A connection between a boy and his dog is undeniably an act of God. Prepare to be amazed

"The system is the establishment. The Democratic Party represents the establishment. Hillary Clinton is the establishment. She has a series of utter scandals that are unprecedented in our history." – Lou Dobbs
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Daniel Getzler | 10154719264941336_10154719747071336 | Hillary and Michelle Obama say when Trump goes low they go high. If going high means rigging the primaries against Bernie and inciting violence at Trump rallies, I'd hate to see them go low
2 | Justin Tuttle | 10154719264941336_10154719750721336 | This is a call to all brothers & sisters of this nation. Do your part this election season, not only make sure you go out & vote this November for Trump. Get your friends & family to do the same. Take pictures of your vote after you cast it, & wear red on election day. Do what is right, whether you're liberal or conservative, democrat or republican, moderate or independent. The DNC has already been caught through Wikileaks documents & Project Veritas journalism that they will stop at nothing to fraud the American people of this great nation to get Hilary Clinton elected. They stole it from Bernie Sanders, & they will try to steal it from Trump. Anything to maintain the status quo, to keep the power, the Donald is correct in saying it's all rigged & that this could be our last chance folks. The polls are there to reflect the fraud, they're trying to stop us from going out to vote, that we will just waste our time if we go vote.That's not true! & it is up to us the people whether we get Donald Trump elected or not. He is winning in their internal polling & several independent polls, don't fall for this sham & get out there & take action. Brexit polls showed the same thing, not leaving was up 10 points on the day of the vote, & they won the vote folks. America will never be the same whichever one is elected, its up to us in choosing which one we deserve & the one we want. We the people cannot let this election be stolen from us at a time so dire, we must win & win big league to MAGA & drain the swamp thank you & God bless you all.
3 | Andrew Pate | 10154719264941336_10154719743296336 | I pray God will open Americans’ eyes to the threats and Lies  that are looming before us. Our unsecured border to the south. China's military buildup in the South China sea. The redrawing of Europe’s borders and Europe now flooded with millions of refugees. ISIS now fully operational in at least 18 countries and growing. Russia’s engagement in Syria where they now have a massive military presence. We need China and Russia as allies not adversaries. America is in a far more dangerous and vulnerable position than we were 8 years ago. And the most dangerous and vulnerable place to be is away from God who has blessed this nation more than any other on earth. The many problems we face cannot be solved by man alone, but we must have Divine help to find peaceful and long-lasting solutions. #ProGodProLifeProRightsProAmerica#ProMillitaryProIsrael “Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD” (Psalm 33:12).
4 | John Guthrie | 10154719264941336_10154719743921336 | My grandfather is voting for Hillary. Tried talking him out of it but he has been dead for a while now. Trump 2016!
5 | Debby Mc | 10154719264941336_10154719790571336 | Please do some house cleaning, I can't watch Geraldo Rivera, Megan Kelly, Juan Williams, Dana Perino... move Shawn Hannity after Bill so I don't have to turn the channel and come back later
6 | Tonda Rae Silinsky | 10154719264941336_10154719788961336 | Lou Dobbs was great! I pray he's right and these discussions are causing people to wake up and pay attention!
7 | William M Sparks | 10154719264941336_10154719759061336 | Hilliary is a bad choice, think people, there are crimes that are associated with her and Bill.  Do we want that in our White House?
8 | Ronald Cooper | 10154719264941336_10154719788766336 | The debates are finished, HERES WHATS NEXT. "The progressives’ goal (Clinton's) is to humiliate and marginalize the majority—to make normal people (us) feel abnormal, to be alone, to be afraid to dissent from what appears to be an overwhelming, media-magnified, Google-approved, Hollywood-polished, Obama-confirmed, irresistible consensus....Democrats believe a demoralized majority (us) can be subjugated by an activist minority when it refuses to fight."We've got to vote. Trump really is this country's last chance.
9 | Thata Asio | 10154719264941336_10154719760246336 | So obvious that she did so many wrong doing. I don't know why many people are still blind to see the real Killary.. Maybe because of the freebies??hmmm
10 | Carole A. Brewer | 10154719264941336_10154719754666336 | The #1 issue for everyone has been the economy, yet the media never explains in details anything about NAFTA, WTO, TPP or how corporate inversion works, even politicians attacking Trump never do, no one explains what he means by a 400% trade imbalance, when they criticize his economic policies they fail to tell you their models and analysis are based on corruption and fraud, you wouldn't even know what these acronyms above were if it wasn't for him, since NAFTA went into effect in 1994 inflation has increased at a record pace while wages have stagnated, inflation increases based on the top wage earners, just so happens every president since then has been named Bush or Clinton, it was a forgone conclusion it'd be that again until Trump, they stopped in 2008 to let a guy who didn't even qualify but was a very charismatic speaker force health care on people, Obamacare was patterned after Romneycare, who was the 2012 election between again? when have you ever been forced to do something in America with no impact on anyone but yourself? they knew baby boomers were about to retire and it was time to chomp through their savings like PAC man, after that your tax $'s support the rest, no regulations on the Doctors or pharmaceutical in this cash cow, cost and deductibles have skyrocketed as you're aware, back to the wasteful spending on military contracts with companies like Lockheed Martin, only Trump ever said this as well, he said we'd stop being the world's police and other countries would pay us, you experts factor that into your BS economic forecasts? Fox News is no better than CNN, they make you think a man in a turban driving a 1984 Tacoma in the desert is about to take over the world, why? Spend more of your money to build military equipment and sell it to other countries, your government spends 2 trillion a year of your taxes on this, uses the national debt as an American Express card, and the Clinton foundation as a tax shelter and slush fund, Trump turned his back on a corrupt juggernaut and became the antichrist, you people trying to stop Trump better be ready to bleed, you've used political correctness to rob a nation blind and build China and Mexico, revolution begins November 8th
11 | Renay Fite | 10154719264941336_10154719786076336 | Trump is the most non-establishment candidate to EVER run on an "establishment" ticket in the history of US politics. Wanna send a message to Washington that u r sick of their BS? Trump 2016!!! I mean c'mon man, he wants to impose Congressional term limits!
12 | Anna Knox | 10154719264941336_10154719831701336 | The whole democratic party is crooked, that is whey they are doing everything to get her elected. We all know that Donna Brazil gave Hillary the questions, the honorable thing for a Presidential candidate would have been to have Donna Brazil fired. but instead crooked Hillary kept her mouth shut and did not do anything. That to me proofs that she is as evil as they come and the news media needs to pursue this issue to the fullest. If anything Hillary needs to go on national television and admit to the American people that she was provided the questions prior to the event, I pray to GOD she does not win the election. enough already for  corruption , ENOUGH  biased news please.Take pride in what you are providing the citizens of this great country.
13 | Amy Modzel | 10154719264941336_10154719759856336 | Just left happy hour & the whole place was for Trump so I brought in all my Trump stickers & signs & EVERYBODY went NUTS!!! What an AWESOME experience :) ... The WORLD LOVES TRUMP!
14 | Raymond Le Floch | 10154719264941336_10154719820341336 | this election is quite possibly the most important 1 in our history!..the democraps are doing everything in their power to character assasinate trump and have been proven..PROVEN to be doing all they can to yes rig the election!!..unprecedented in our history,the dems and all the corruptables in D.C. and wall street are scared to death that mr.trump will prevail inspite of all the corrupt and illegal actions they have and are continueing to take against him!..why?..because he is not corrupt and cannot be bought so they are terrified of having to be honest and do the right thing by US THE PEOPLE OF THE U.S.OF A.! what will you tell your children or grandchildren when this country goes down the drain if hillbilly is elected??..anyone with a working brain cannot ignore the mountain of evidence against her! and she goes in the last debate and reveals what our nuke response time is!!..that 1 act alone should have her arrested for treason against the u.s.a.! don"t think for 1 second the north koreans,china,russia were all paying attention and probably shocked when they heard her reveal that!..
15 | Jordan Braswell | 10154719264941336_10154719834351336 | Yea Donald Trump will win and the criminal Media and Elites better back the hell of off this one we are all done putting up with this criminal system. Now what I am about to say I mean I would weather die then let Hillary Clinton move into the White House she will destroy the world if she wins. Plus there is voting fraud people don't listen to the criminal media they are Brian washing the public we have to watch out for voting fraud!!!
16 | Charlotte Lasater Poteet | 10154719264941336_10154719840356336 | Racist White. Hmm , there you go again.  He'll do more for the blacks, Hispanics etc than the Democratic every did for you buddy. Time to quit sleeping
17 | Charlene Maguill | 10154719264941336_10154719872906336 | Trump by landslide!!!! Americans cannot afford another 8 years of unstable healthcare, economy, crime, safety, payroll taxes being raised again like Obama did that hurts pay being reduced for working families
18 | Mark Kinder | 10154719264941336_1958053251088321 | It's a shame to see how many American people are supporting Hillary Clinton when all the facts have come out about the corruption she has been involved with and the obvious lies that you would have to be totally blind and deft not to see that they exist. Hillary is a total insider that will not correct the problems in this country and around the world. Trump will make the real changes this country needs for the people and not the elite like Hillary. Vote Trump.
19 | Winfield Koski | 10154719264941336_10154719799706336 | Thank you Lou Dobbs, for your honesty and profound wisdom on this issue. We have to support Donald Trump for our next President Of The United States of America!!!
20 | Nick Maxwell | 10154719264941336_571828869668590 | POINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary? She has left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her or knew too much!
21 | Susan Whitt | 10154719264941336_10154719790871336 | I really have tried my best to try and understand HOW anyone can vote for Hillary. .ok I understand if you don't want to vote for Trump. ..then please either vote for someone else or not at all...with everything that has come out of what that woman has done. ...someone please explain this to me!!!!!
22 | Michael Ballard | 10154719264941336_10154719785196336 | Lies, Deception, and Corruption, OBAMA and Hillary Clinton's offer to the people of America.ANDThe promise of more free stuff to the"give me free stuff" people that vote for a living.ANDAnd the MEDIA just promote, feed, and accept her LIES....
23 | We Are Conservative Christians And Proud Americans | 10154719264941336_10154719876261336 | Funny how the left love to claim that the Right is being "Paranoid" every time they get CAUGHT Breaking the law! So if we Witness John Doe robbing a bank and we tell the police John Doe robbed the bank, then we're being paranoid? What the Heck?!
24 | Jack Bo | 10154719264941336_10154719902061336 | So Pissed at the media. All the Wiki Leaks and  video of foul play and even Fox News hardly covers. They are in bed together. Don't trust any of them. Vote with whom you think will outwork the other. That is without a doubt Donald J Trump.
25 | Mark Duckworth | 10154719264941336_10154719858506336 | It's very sad when we can no longer get straight up honest news from journalists representing our major networks and instead trust Wiki leaks as an honest news source.

In Harrisonburg, Virginia, the FBI and local authorities are investigating after 20 dead people re-registered to vote this year.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Roz Bellantuono | 10154719374826336_10154719599951336 | So, then Donald Trump was not wrong when he said he would not accept election results!!! If the dead are voting, I'd say there's  evidence of fraud.
2 | Susan Gomperts | 10154719374826336_10154719596081336 | VOTE DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT! #veteranmomsfortrump
3 | Katie Dettelbach | 10154719374826336_10154719603536336 | Yet Obama tried to make Trump look stupid by saying that there's no way voter fraud could ever occur and no evidence that it ever has. I don't care what your political affiliation is, this is just insane. People need to wake up.
4 | Chrissy Buccella Tobin | 10154719374826336_10154719598866336 | Wait, what? I thought there wasn't any? Trump is a conspiracy nut, huh not so much a nut when this is FINALLY being exposed for what it is!!
5 | John E. Collins III | 10154719374826336_10154719607736336 | Let's Go America! We all must get out on November 8 and vote for Donald Trump! Whether you are a Democrat, Republican or Independent, there is no way we can elect Crooked Hillary Clinton as our next president! She is the most corrupt politician to ever run for the presidency! She is a globalist, not a nationalist! We must elect Donald Trump in order to have real change in the way our federal government manages affairs at home and abroad! Vote Trump 2016! God Bless You Donald Trump!
6 | Bob Hope | 10154719374826336_10154719596491336 | Hillary has this election wrapped up. It's so pathetic that the GOP nominated a racist, sexist, narcissistic, orange clown who's not only a sexual predator but also a pathological liar. So much for the party of family values and personal responsibility. On a side note, my favorite line from the debate: "No puppet. No puppet. You're the puppet!" (lol what is he, 6?)
7 | Robin Hammett Ross | 10154719374826336_10154719600426336 | So what Trump has been saying is true, but the media wont comment about it or broadcast it. These news station need to be fine for lying an hiding the truth from the public.
8 | Amy VanEpps | 10154719374826336_10154719610171336 | This is why there needs to be a law requiring photo identification to vote. A person could go to a dozen polling places and vote for people they know haven't voted. Go early and vote for people who they know don't go until after work. A person cannot buy a lighter without ID. But can vote without one.
9 | Todd Mixon | 10154719374826336_10154719595871336 | The #1 issue for everyone has been the economy, yet the media never explains in details anything about NAFTA, WTO, TPP or how corporate inversion works, even politicians attacking Trump never do, no one explains what he means by a 400% trade imbalance, when they criticize his economic policies they fail to tell you their models and analysis are based on corruption and fraud, you wouldn't even know what these acronyms above were if it wasn't for him, since NAFTA went into effect in 1994 inflation has increased at a record pace while wages have stagnated, inflation increases based on the top wage earners, just so happens every president since then has been named Bush or Clinton, it was a forgone conclusion it'd be that again until Trump, they stopped in 2008 to let a guy who didn't even qualify but was a very charismatic speaker force health care on people, Obamacare was patterned after Romneycare, who was the 2012 election between again? when have you ever been forced to do something in America with no impact on anyone but yourself? they knew baby boomers were about to retire and it was time to chomp through their savings like PAC man, after that your tax $'s support the rest, no regulations on the Doctors or pharmaceutical in this cash cow, cost and deductibles have skyrocketed as you're aware, back to the wasteful spending on military contracts with companies like Lockheed Martin, only Trump ever said this as well, he said we'd stop being the world's police and other countries would pay us, you experts factor that into your BS economic forecasts? Fox News is no better than CNN, they make you think a man in a turban driving a 1984 Tacoma in the desert is about to take over the world, why? Spend more of your money to build military equipment and sell it to other countries, your government spends 2 trillion a year of your taxes on this, uses the national debt as an American Express card, and the Clinton foundation as a tax shelter and slush fund, Trump turned his back on a corrupt juggernaut and became the antichrist, you people trying to stop Trump better be ready to bleed, you've used political correctness to rob a nation blind and build China and Mexico, revolution begins November 8th
10 | Cheryl Longeway Hogan | 10154719374826336_10154719612736336 | What, this can't be happening. This goes against everything the media and Democrats say is possible. 💩
11 | Rocco Lo | 10154719374826336_10154719617521336 | 800+ illegal immigrants were "accidentally" made US Citizens. Head of the DNC Debbie W Shultz was caught rigging the election against Bernie Sanders. And 2 videos were leaked by 2 Democrats talking about how the DNC rig the elections by "busing", and how the DNC stir up chaos at Trump rallies!  Now, dead people are voting! Yeah! I think we may be on to something!
12 | Bedri Arifi | 10154719374826336_10154719607521336 | & they laugh at Trump and make him seem like a crying baby when he says this election is rigged! 🙈... I've seen first hand that family members have gotten voters notice in the mail for thanking them for their vote and they didn't even vote yet!
13 | Boyd Campbell | 10154719374826336_10154719608141336 | The fbi??? (not even worthy of proper capitalization any longer)And we're supposed to think, what? That someone will actually be held accountable or put in jail for fraud? Gimme a break folks.
14 | Bryan Camp | 10154719374826336_10154719609031336 | This is why every state should have voter ID laws in place. You have to have an ID for almost everything, from credit cards, to check cashing, to library books. Cmon people, it's not rocket science. Give them away for free...
15 | Betty Mackenzie | 10154719374826336_10154719610091336 | The libs have spoke all week about him being crazy because he says the system is rigged, voter fraud, etc.......... they are scambling around like a bunch of chickens......... and look at all the dead people voting cases that have come out this week........ The Donald is no dummy.......... He's making them all sweat in DC....... and I love it!!!!! Can't wait til he is in the white house!
16 | Wes Mikel | 10154719374826336_10154719611521336 | I thought the democrats swore up and down that voter fraud doesn't exist??? Wake up people!!!! The democrats are the ones committing the overwhelming majority of voter fraud.
17 | Dwain Peevey | 10154719374826336_1276349459063915 | I would like for someone, anyone, to show me concrete irrefutable proof that possessing a state-issued ID card, to be able to vote, is discriminatory to minorities and/or economically disadvantaged individuals.
18 | Amy Lynn Reel | 10154719374826336_626226100891112 | And the local Harrisonburg news had a segment on last night with Cokie Roberts and a local news caster and Cokie spoke about voter fraud.  Cokie said it doesn't happen and the local news caster, Bob Corso never bothered to mention what happened here in Harrisonburg, VA.
19 | John Schneider | 10154719374826336_10154719623831336 | Oh, stop whining. (sarcasm).The democrats have some explaining to do.But here's what'll happen: They'll debunk this as fraudulent reporting or blame someone who they will disassociate from the party.Fact is that the voter fraud has been around for years and there's plenty of examples.The democrats always deny it because they benefit the most.
20 | Emily M. M. Wright | 10154719374826336_10154719627051336 | Since You are reporting this - would you please tell also who these dead people voted for??? 🤔#RiggedElections🇺🇸MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!🇺🇸💞💋❤️🇺🇸TRUMP - PENCE🇺🇸❤️💋💞
21 | Kelsey Marie Dean | 10154719374826336_642355682591092 | We are screwed if Hillary becomes president! Wake up America! Why don't you all look into all the stuff this woman has been doing for all these years! Like I said WAKE THE HECK UP!!! #TrumpPence2016 #GetonTheTrumpTrain #BeSmartAmerica 🇺🇸
22 | Lenore Hackenyos-Rizzi | 10154719374826336_1232151796899485 | Obviously someone is orchestrating that.  I watched people lie on CNN today and say all the cases of voter fraud had been discounted as accidental - paid for by HRC.
23 | Diane Miller | 10154719374826336_1276325795732948 | And we're suppose to trust the FBI investigating voter fraud , when they cover up a presidential nominees criminal actions,and lies to them..Leave it for the local authorities,the fbi needs to stay out of this
24 | Mike Jentz | 10154719374826336_1421533074526934 | We need to investigate Hillary's entire campaign. Countless videos of democratic campain managers etc admitting to bussing illegal immigrants around the US and giving them voter ID's.
25 | Brad Kiter | 10154719374826336_626245424222513 | But, but , but... Trump says mean things and just a whiner. Election fraud is impossible. LolYet again Mr. Trump faces huge backlash, but turns out he is also right again. As if the projectveritas wasn't proof enough.

A new batch of WikiLeaks emails surfaced with stunning charges that Hillary Clinton was at the center of negotiating a $12 million commitment from King Mohammed VI of Morocco.

2 | Zack Gianino | 10154719372606336_10154719465081336 | Yea yea yea...but did you know, possibly, just maybe..apparently... trump  groped a lady 49 years ago... y'all do realize that's way more important than the scary reality that Hillary Clinton has been engaging in pay to play operations with some of the most authoritarian regimes .. 😑
3 | Antonio DaSilva | 10154719372606336_10154719467116336 | The text bellow was copied and past from the net: "If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas.Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary? She has left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her or knew too much!"

5 | Harold Jalonen | 10154719372606336_10154719466966336 | #nevertrumpers are a disgusting aberration in the Republican party. If they continue their resistance against Trump, then we Trump supporters need to vote against them to burn the Republican party to the ground. It is time to drain the swamp, and it starts at home!
6 | Annette Chirichella | 10154719372606336_10154719460051336 | Educate yourselves: Spread this everywhere....If you're under 50 you really need to read this. If you’re over 50, you lived through it, so share it with those under 50. Amazing to me how much I had forgotten!When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn’t even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood – both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno – husband Bill described her selection as “my worst mistake.” Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovery of Ms. Guanier’s radical views, her name had to be withdrawn from consideration.Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations. She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.Many younger votes will have no knowledge of “Travelgate.” Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson – and the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds. A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House. Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the scandal defense. Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were:She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary’s game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, “I do not recall,” “I have no recollection,” and “I don’t know” a total of 56 times while under oath.After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen.Now we are exposed to the destruction of possibly incriminating emails while Hillary was Secretary of State and the “pay to play” schemes of the Clinton Foundation – we have no idea what shoe will fall next. But to her loyal fans (supporters) - I guess in her own words “what difference does it make?” I guess being a female Democrat is all that matters. By the way, I'd post the same if she were a Republican. You see, she's already been in the White House, she has a record we can review.Hillary for prison 2016 would be a good start to help make America safe again.“The woman has proven herself a national security risk who isn’t mentally or physically able to perform the duties required of a Head of State,” Hillary Body Double ??????What's Hillary suffering from?

10 | Desmond Philip | 10154719372606336_10154719465086336 | WikiLeaks emails from Barack Obama’s personal email account reveal that the Bush administration contacted the future president multiple times before the election, secretly organizing the transition of power. The 2008 transition had gone down in history as surprisingly smooth. Martha Joynt Kumar, in a book about the transition, said it “ was the best in anyone’s memory, in part because 9/11 made everyone recognize that a transition is fragile time.” Today’s revelations raise questions about why it was so smooth — suggestions Obama was selected by the shadow government, rather than elected by the people, are no longer tinfoil hat territory. The most eye catching email in today’s leak contains a message from John Podesta about an invitation from President George W. Bush to the “President-Elect.” Should that have read “President-Select?” Podesta sent the email to Obama before the election result was known. But it gets even worse. The emails show a transition plan was being worked on long before the 2008 election had taken place. According to an attached memo in one of the emails, Obama was already discussing his transition to office with members of the Bush Administration, including then- Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, prior to the election. “ As you have observed in your interactions with Secretary Paulson, he is apparently eager to involve you and your transition team extensively in his policy choices following the election. “ Are Presidents elected or selected? Another attached memo acknowledges that it was unusual to start the transition process so soon. “ We are now at the point of deciding how to staff economic policy during the transition, who should be the point of contact with Treasury and how to blend the transition and campaign economic policy talent. Normally these decisions could be made after the election, and ideally after the selection of a National Economic Advisor, but, of course, these are not normal times. “ Not normal times? Perhaps not in 2008. But eight years later, it seems nothing has changed. What was “not normal” in 2008 has become very much the norm in 2016. Thanks to WikiLeaks and the unprecedented peek behind the curtains of power they have granted us, the shadow government has been exposed to the light. 2008 wasn’t a smooth transition of power, it was silky smooth power consolidation. WikiLeaks’ variety of journalism – cold, hard, pristine truth – has more than ruffled feathers. The entire henhouse has gone mad. The ruling party are slavering at the mouth, and mainstream media has never been so easy to see through. Watch CNN’s Scott Cuomo, the same guy caught lying to Americans about their First Amendment rights, put himself in the running for a Razzie Award after the network pulled an interview with Rep. Chris Collins as soon as he mentioned WikiLeaks.
11 | Joulia Stoliarova | 10154719372606336_10154719477231336 | Why don’t we talk about the fact that Obama should not be going around the country to promote Hillary?

NEITHER HILLARY NOR GEORGE SOROS, believe in American sovereignty and they will make America become a third world country without security. She is so dangerous to our country . Nov.8 is the last chance to save the country. Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, do your duty to rid Washington D.C. of the corrupt political class which is protected by the corrupt main stream press and networks. The 600,000 unvetted refugees to enter our country that Hillary wants, who are infiltrated by ISIS, living in poverty, with no health care. Hillary is dangerous and nuts. Where are the jobs and the health care for them, when Obamacare is imploding?
17 | Tom Nixon | 10154719372606336_10154719463876336 | The Russians aren't behind her e-mails, we already know this. Keep believing her liberals, everything on these are true, so keep having that blind eye!!
18 | Cassandra Worthington | 10154719372606336_10154719487396336 | How can she even be allowed to run for president??? She should be in prison. She's the most corrupt evil politician I've ever seen. Dont subject our troops to her as their commander and cheif they deserve a leader not a killer. Remember Benghazi. America deserves to be Great Again.
19 | Theresa Archuletta | 10154719372606336_613287195525995 | We should start emailing Paul Ryan and the Republican Party in Washington 1 million strong emails and let them know that if they don't get behind Donald Trump we're going to remember them when it comes time to vote for them
20 | Joseph Esteves | 10154719372606336_613272992194082 | IF its from WikiLeaks well.....................Chain of custody (CoC), in legal contexts, refers to the chronological documentation or paper trail, showing the seizure, custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of physical or electronic evidence.None of the information from WikiLeaks meets this criteria. Information from WikiLeaks is just as reliable as Information from a barbershop conversation, a beauty salon conversation and a television talk show. WikiLeaks is all B.S. to make it Important when it is Irrelevant. And most important lets not forget the head of Wikeleaks is hiding out in a 3rd world country because he is wanted for RAPE. Now this is someone we are suppose to BELIEVE. The only one who would believe him would be a FOOL.
21 | Charles Kimmel | 10154719372606336_1178952002180054 | Hillary stooge Chris Wallace congratulates himself on Brit Hume's show for the great job he did, although the American people gave him a grade of "F" on the debate because he let the Corrupt Liar say that when she referred to "Open Borders" in the secret Brazilian Bank Transcript, she was talking about energy. Chris failed to even question her twisting of her lies.  Chris Wallace, you are a disgrace!
22 | Frank Prestia | 10154719372606336_1259403617415046 | How sad is it that the only way the world can find out the truth is through an organisation like Wikileaks. The mainstream media denies its readers the fullness of information to enable its readers the capability of deciding what the truth really is.
23 | Jim Bulleit | 10154719372606336_10154719498226336 | Perhaps she is a lying, traitorous, manipulating, embezzling, corrupt, bloviant with delusions of godhood who believes she is entitled to the office of President, but did she grab King Mohammad by the pu**y? I think not.
24 | Mark Bush | 10154719372606336_1178950248846896 | The GOP could have devastated Clinton in this election but, because too many ignorant fools thought Trump was some kind of a savior, she is going to get elected and do this from the White House.  Thanks a lot, Trumpanzees, you ripped defeat from the jaws of victory!!!
25 | Cindy Knotts | 10154719372606336_10154719497091336 | If Corrupt and Crooked Hillary wins this election because of voter fraud and because the media is in bed with her, WE WILL REVOLT!! After this election I will NEVER watch any news organization EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!! I'm not alone!!😠

Cory Hearon took to Facebook to live-stream what he was witnessing, explaining that otherwise no one would believe it was real.

1 | Amanda Williams | 10154719248676336_10154719387046336 | When Jesus returns, the angels will descend first sounding the trumpet. I think the Lord is warning us, telling us to get ready. Call me stupid, an idiot, make snide remarks....I don't care. He tells us to watch the things going on around us and take notice. When He comes back, me and mine will be ready. I hope you will be too. Every knee will bow,every tongue will confess, Jesus is Lord. You can do it now or on that day. But I'd say do it now.
2 | Joseph Ravenscroft | 10154719248676336_10154719363626336 | Or it's a phoenix. Symbolizing the rebirth of the United States under Trump
3 | Telisa Brittain | 10154719248676336_10154719387871336 | So disgusting how people are so quick to mock someone else's beliefs. Kinda sad really. I feel sorry for all those on here who feel the need to put other people down to build yourself up.
4 | Angelica Garcia | 10154719248676336_10154719430136336 | I got chills looking at this. As a Christian, I feel as if God is letting us know He is with us. I know so many ppl have been praying for our nation with this election and all and maybe it's His way of answering our prayers and letting us know we are not alone.
5 | Robert Martinez | 10154719248676336_10154719367751336 | The virgin mother was going to make an appearance, but she was scheduled for a sighting on a grill cheese sandwich in Tampa at 5 later that day.
6 | Krista Anheluk | 10154719248676336_10154719364556336 | Let's hope they're all watching out for this country right now
7 | Lisa Fox Stone | 10154719248676336_10154719377251336 | Super cool! I see an angel. Thanks for sharing. I love it.
8 | Casey Thompson | 10154719248676336_10154719378316336 | Psalms 19:1 "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."
9 | Tom Nixon | 10154719248676336_10154719364551336 | Praying for all of us because we have such a corrupt Government!!
10 | Liz Dillon Fury | 10154719248676336_10154719368626336 | I hope the angel is watching over our country right now.
11 | David Brooks | 10154719248676336_1805489066402052 | We can often imagine shapes in clouds. But I have captured several images identical to this one over the past year. The resemblance is uncanny. Something is happening ! Something real
12 | Manuel Salas | 10154719248676336_10154719442536336 | Its just a cloud formation that has been dragged into shape by the wind rising up in the upper atmosphere due to changes in temperature people. Nothing more, read a book, a scientific book.
13 | Michele Palmer Sloan | 10154719248676336_10154719369151336 | Watched it live. Amazing. Clouds move this never moves. I guess you have to be a believer.
14 | Tammi Lee Spearman | 10154719248676336_10154719420206336 | It looks like a seraphim angel as it has six wings! But all the wings are extended! Two are not covering the eyes or the feet! I believe in angels! The book of Hebrews says beware when entertaining strangers as some are angels unaware! Whatsoever we do in Christ name we do as into him! Be kind to others in Jesus name it will accredited to you as you did it to him!
15 | Tracy Ann Byrne Podias | 10154719248676336_10154719405476336 | Geez why are people so mean and cynical. Where the world is right now on the precipice of the most important election where we literally need to keep evil out of power, it could be a sign. Those non believers why even exist when your life is meaningless.
16 | Paul Mousseau | 10154719248676336_10154719401736336 | Romans 10:9 (KJV)9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

18 | Christina Wolbert | 10154719248676336_1752792938315404 | Love how all of these people got smart mocking comments!! You won't be mocking him one day when you stand in judgement! No wonder this countries gone to hell! Sad!
19 | Carolyn Shows Abshire | 10154719248676336_1805489199735372 | I ask Jesus to show me something in the clouds everyday and he does .. my favorite time of the day is watering my flowers .. because he shows me some pretty awesome things ... I believe he's given me a gift to see what others can't .. not saying he won't show u .. but it's a me and Jesus thing ...
20 | Kyle Caswell | 10154719248676336_10154719371281336 | A cat hacking up a hairball? A butterfly? A tulip on a breezy spring morning? No wait, it's the tail of a giant whale playing in the North Atlantic!! I never was good at these ink blot tests.............
21 | Prince Singh | 10154719248676336_10154719417156336 | You people are the most dumbest people everr. It's just a stupid cloud and you guys think it's an a message from God , seriously , all it takes is a few words and pictures to put anything in ur minds.
22 | Kirsten Signar | 10154719248676336_10154719383791336 | It clearly is a cloud resembling the likes of our perception of angels...which certainly doesn't mean it's not also an angel 😊
23 | Connie Maria Harrison-Bressler | 10154719248676336_1752824391645592 | It's beautiful... It's the little things that silently proclaim God's amazing work of His hands that I love the most... from a butterfly to a beautiful cloud that resembles an angel.. how great is our God?!
24 | Marge Parker | 10154719248676336_535293270005263 | Have u noticed that this kept its position and did I not move????   Clouds and a thing else in the sky moves pretty quick and dissipates. This is not moving or disappearing.  The blind will never see until it is too late.
25 | Mirasol Presley | 10154719248676336_1805507859733506 | The coming of the Lord Jesus is near, nobody known went, but this is also a warning to those until now are not born again , He is surely will come, Repent ! or you will be left behind. Obey John 3:3-4, Acts 2:38-39 sincerely in your heart and be part of the family of God.

1 | Deanna Reid | 10154719046606336_10154719241001336 | Just stopped by to say I cannot stand you Hillary and you are corruption at it's finest and I will never vote for you!
2 | Michael Bradley | 10154719046606336_569321776601285 | How can someone claim to be a Christian and vote for Hillary? She believes in murdering unborn babies. Examine your lives. Read the word of God. You will find the truth.
3 | Lance Buell | 10154719046606336_10154719244996336 | Still waiting for her supporters to come up with one of her accomplishments!
4 | Keith Johnson | 10154719046606336_1806450802948404 | O look, she has about 500 people she had bussed in. She is the most corrupt person to ever run for President. If we had a real President in the White House she would be in jail today!
5 | Dean Horace | 10154719046606336_984892648285980 | I told you I would never tell anybody Hillary, but since your foundation didn't pay me the money... Hillary groped me behind a Blockbuster Video in Arkansas a few years ago... lmfao
6 | Dayna Cunningham | 10154719046606336_1174063382661305 | And shame on Obama flying around campaigningfor Hillary. It cost 200,000 us dollars an hour to fly Air Force one. That's all tax payers money. How is this even legal?

8 | Bill Carriveau | 10154719046606336_816072958496068 | Hillary said she wanted more gun control rights and regulations to protect toddlers and then a few minutes later condoned butchering a full-term baby in the mother's womb. She is evil to the core.(Q)
9 | Karl Suggs | 10154719046606336_569319939934802 | She doesn't care about how many people are there. She has voting machines controlled by George Soros in 16 major states. He can make them say that shw won, even if she didn't.
10 | Lizzy Beth | 10154719046606336_1792099237735372 | We the people of the united states of America wants justice you Hillary belong in prison we won't stop till justice is done

12 | Susan Bonsall | 10154719046606336_1424423057587782 | Anyone who says they work for the children but supports abortion till one week before the due date is a MONSTER with no soul.
13 | Lisa N Bailey | 10154719046606336_1106242759454184 | It makes me sick to see and hear her, knowing the terrible things she has done...Hillary for Prison! Btw, I just stopped by to see all the angry emojis 😂
14 | Patricia Fulton | 10154719046606336_1247572815305585 | Wonder how many of those people were paid to be there?
15 | Brittany DeRisi | 10154719046606336_1129585577078726 | She is supposed to be winning this election. Lmao all I see here is how much everyone else hates her just like me. She shouldn't even have the privilege to call herself an AMERICAN.
16 | Anne Dale-Deeb | 10154719046606336_1610045025965041 | I'm reading these comments and practically everyone HATES her. Almost every woman I know thinks she's a disgust POS. If she wins, it is definitely rigged!!!
17 | Deb Kobus | 10154719046606336_879890392110803 | Geez, another ugly pand suit, no American flag lapel pin either.

19 | Debora Brown-Steffens | 10154719046606336_1870056129894497 | Hillary, you are the most lying corrupt woman I've even encountered in my whole entire life! Bernie Sanders told the truth about you! Thief! Liar!
20 | Deborah Robinson | 10154719046606336_1423352494361528 | Hillary you are a horrible woman , if you and Jack the Ripper was running for president I would vote for Jack the Ripper.
21 | Linda Venema | 10154719046606336_10154719247376336 | When Hillary goes LOW--her campaign staff and media goes LOWER!!
22 | Ethan Meyer | 10154719046606336_816075611829136 | Fake, dusty old Wall Street controlled puppet. She has no vision, no goals, just massive third world immigration for her donors and more pointless war in the Middle East.
23 | Val Scarpaci | 10154719046606336_930669297044710 | "Lets have a 1st woman president"...howd having a 1st black president work?...is that who we are? Vote the issues, not the personalities. Dont make America the refugee Holiday Inn....
24 | Sergio Severino Chua | 10154719046606336_704370643058873 | It's not over yet until the fat lady sings, Hillary!  Don't be so relaxed and over-confident!  The liberal pollsters are make- believe probably paid for by your campaign.
25 | Bill Krutt | 10154719046606336_1848252475404726 | The camera NEVER, EVER pans out at her "events" ....... It'd show how small the venue is and that not many people are there.

A letter from George H.W. Bush to President Bill Clinton is going viral after Donald J. Trump refused to commit to accepting the outcome of the presidential election at the last debate. http://bit.ly/2ewERJl
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | John Strauch | 10154719050026336_10154719055671336 | If I was competing in a rigged/heavily biased election I wouldn't necessarily accept the results either. Seems like basic common sense/logic.
2 | Mary Saoirse Phillips | 10154719050026336_10154719055031336 | I'm watching the Presidential Debate and has anyone noticed that 1) Hillary has a teleprompter in her podium that Trump does not as you can see his area is dark and her's has a light and 2) She wore white to hide the light reflecting off of her. She keeps looking down when she is talking....why? Because she is reading her answer. RIGGED.
3 | Marie Raquel | 10154719050026336_10154719067581336 | Quit making a big deal over what trump said. The media is twisting what he said. With all the corruption going on trump was wise not to "commit" he said he would have to wait and see! Smart!
4 | Michelle DeChick | 10154719050026336_10154719069506336 | Difference...Bush was already the President...not at all the same. CLARIFICATION...Trump never said he wouldn't accept the outcome...and furthermore, he should challenge the votes if necessary, seeing as how criminal Hillary is.
5 | Rhonda Robertson Schaefer | 10154719050026336_10154719067916336 | Why would Trump concede 3 weeks before an election!! Why didn't they ask Hillary if she would accept the results when SHE LOSES!!!!
6 | Jerry Aherne | 10154719050026336_10154719066066336 | But when George W Bush won the Presidency the Clintons stole over $300,000 worth of furnishings from the White House and removed all W's off all keyboards.
7 | Ian Ka | 10154719050026336_10154719057626336 | Why don't FOX News run their own Hillary vs Trump poll here on Facebook. It takes a few seconds to set up. We could see real people's opinions based on a much larger sample set than the random polls that news networks have and predict the elections based on 500 votes.
8 | Kim Allison Robison | 10154719050026336_10154719068766336 | Shows class...kinda thinking that Bill didn't do that when George W became president. I think I remember the Clintons stealing from the White House before they left!
9 | Steve Ankelein | 10154719050026336_10154719077906336 | Give me a break. This letter is from an out going president to the in coming president. Trump saying he'll let you know later isn't refusing to accept the results. More thug media BS!
10 | Robin Turpin | 10154719050026336_10154719077091336 | I wouldn't except either. Especially after the voter fraud video by O'Keefe.  Soros owns the Smartmatic machines in 16 states is another reason. I'm sure he won't be helping with cheating. Be sarcastic here. Hillary shouldn't even be running for President. She should be in Prison.
11 | Barbara Chopko | 10154719050026336_10154719075276336 | i have always respected the Bush's but after cry baby Jeb lost and the Bush's decided they were going to stand with Hillary it made me sick. What if the republicans decided years ago to stand with Gore and not support Gw but we didn't . To throw Trump under the bus was like telling the people that voted for Gw to go to hell. Shame on all of you .
12 | Edie Stephenson Houston | 10154719050026336_1760952887503631 | Don't want to hear from Bush anymore...he is a traitor to his party for refusing to support the Repubicans' nominee, and even supposedly stating that he will vote for Slick Hilly (slick Willy's wife!)
13 | Patricia Thilmony | 10154719050026336_1760955827503337 | If Fox is expecting to turn some support around for Killary by showing this video, they failed. The day Bush came out for KILLARY is the last day there will be a possibility of a Bush win on a Republican ticket. I will never forget. I will never support any republican who tipped the scales of this election to KILLARY.
14 | Steve Hahn | 10154719050026336_10154719084856336 | Great letter, but Mr Trump hasn't  refused, he very intelligently by the way is waiting to see. President Bush may have very well been cheated by Mr Clinton, but never so brash or obviously blatant as hillary has with Mr Trump. Yes...I too am one of his deplorables.
15 | Jimmy Goodman | 10154719050026336_10154719070471336 | One, bill wasn't half as bad as Killary, at least when he started office. Two, the bushes and Clintons are both part of the big political machine.
16 | Janice Greene | 10154719050026336_10154719090271336 | George H. W. Bush went to Haiti with Bill Clinton, they held hands walking thru the rubble , now Bush is for HRC.  Could this be blackmail , the Clinton's kept millions of donated money intended to rebuild Haiti and take care of those devastated ,  did Bush have his hand in the cookie jar as well and now the Clinton's have something on the Bush family?  Just thinking.
17 | Noel Ibarra | 10154719050026336_10154719068006336 | Why are Trump supporters so bitter and angry....be happy and smile, it's Friday ....no matter the outcome, we are still one country and need to work together.
18 | Lynda Boatman Collins | 10154719050026336_10154719080266336 | Very touching letter...BUT what about when democrats wouldn't not even admit that his son won the election over Gore for his entire term.  Oh yeah that election was stolen because Gore was a democrat....pfffft. I call BS
19 | Kathleen Bowers | 10154719050026336_10154719123691336 | Right now I don't care what any of the Bushes have to say ! I was a supporter and honestly I needed them to support the person we picked to represent our party.
20 | Francine Felix Cole | 10154719050026336_10154719120456336 | Can someone tell me what the point of all this is? He wrote the letter after Clinton was already elected. One has absolutely NOTHING to do with the other. I'm so TIRED of the media sensationalizing every little comment he makes!
21 | Laura Jacobson Mangum | 10154719050026336_10154719098591336 | It would have been the dumbest thing he could have done, to agree to that statement. I agree with John Strauch, common sense. It was also a "gotcha" question that should have been also asked of her. There seem to be an assumption that she will win, why? Because it is rigged in her favor.
22 | Jeff Haddad | 10154719050026336_10154719076926336 | You think he would of learned a thing or two from President Bush! Instead they vandalized the White House, removed the "W's" from all the computers, and stole furniture!
23 | Danielle Smith | 10154719050026336_10154719072021336 | Did he send him one for his impeachment? Or when the scandal broke and he disgraced the country by sexually molesting an intern with a cigar?? Or maybe one on advice for removing the stain left from ejaculating on her dress?!? Let's be real here... I'm sure it was done with great intention and integrity on Bush's part but ZERO comparison to today's election...
24 | Ron Nelson | 10154719050026336_1315542975176567 | Why should anyone concede an election until the last vote is counted. If Truman had conceded then Thomas Dewey would have been the president. The Dems would love it if Trump said he would accept and concede then they would gain an advantage before November 8. Gore didn't concede and the Supreme Court had to tell him it was over. So they don't have much of a leg to stand on.
25 | Jaccob Scott Barnes | 10154719050026336_10154719060226336 | So I guess Trump shouldn't be president now. That where Megyn Kelly is going with this? Because he doesn't trust our ever strengthening, merit based election system? #50andDropping #FoxNewsisaJoke

1 | Todd Mixon | 10154718910226336_10154718933756336 | Oh yeah it's about to get crazy, the next month is going to be biblical America, strap in and stay the course
2 | Sheldon Ziro | 10154718910226336_10154718957821336 | If you want more useless spending, more money wasted/stimulus, higher taxes, less money in your own pocket, more/bigger government, more anti-Christianity, more Muslim refugees, more pro-policies, more anti-American sentiment, more anti-2nd amendment, anti-free speech, and more "send your country over the cliff and destroy the greatest nation the world has ever known" actions, then by all means, vote for Hillary...she's your man. If you want to keep more of your money, pay lower taxes, have a strong military that keeps you and your family safe, someone who will protect and defend our rights and freedoms, and most importantly, appoint judges to the Supreme Court who will follow and uphold the constitution, then please, just use the common sense that God provides a dog with, and vote for Trump. He's no saint, but he at least professes to love what made our country great in the first place and is saying he'll do his best to restore and protect those things. He certainly doesn't need this in his life. He had everything and then some. He did this because he couldn't stand to see what's happening to this once great nation. And once it's over, it's over. If Hillary wins, I promise you this: even the most progressive liberals out there will eventually regret it. She will not make America great. She will continue to run it into the ground until it's 6 feet under though. It'll be obama on steroids. It'll be the end of America as we've known it. May God have mercy on our country. And if you know anything about mercy and grace, it's totally undeserved. We need a miracle but for now, Donald Trump is the best thing we've got going for us to move in the right direction. So, if you hate America and want to see it destroyed, vote Hillary. If you love what made America great in the first place, love the freedoms we have, and love the future of your own offspring, then Trump is the only logical conclusion. #trump2016 #neverhillary

4 | Desmond Philip | 10154718910226336_10154719313046336 | WikiLeaks emails from Barack Obama’s personal email account reveal that the Bush administration contacted the future president multiple times before the election, secretly organizing the transition of power. The 2008 transition had gone down in history as surprisingly smooth. Martha Joynt Kumar, in a book about the transition, said it “ was the best in anyone’s memory, in part because 9/11 made everyone recognize that a transition is fragile time.” Today’s revelations raise questions about why it was so smooth — suggestions Obama was selected by the shadow government, rather than elected by the people, are no longer tinfoil hat territory. The most eye catching email in today’s leak contains a message from John Podesta about an invitation from President George W. Bush to the “President-Elect.” Should that have read “President-Select?” Podesta sent the email to Obama before the election result was known. But it gets even worse. The emails show a transition plan was being worked on long before the 2008 election had taken place. According to an attached memo in one of the emails, Obama was already discussing his transition to office with members of the Bush Administration, including then- Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, prior to the election. “ As you have observed in your interactions with Secretary Paulson, he is apparently eager to involve you and your transition team extensively in his policy choices following the election. “ Are Presidents elected or selected? Another attached memo acknowledges that it was unusual to start the transition process so soon. “ We are now at the point of deciding how to staff economic policy during the transition, who should be the point of contact with Treasury and how to blend the transition and campaign economic policy talent. Normally these decisions could be made after the election, and ideally after the selection of a National Economic Advisor, but, of course, these are not normal times. “ Not normal times? Perhaps not in 2008. But eight years later, it seems nothing has changed. What was “not normal” in 2008 has become very much the norm in 2016. Thanks to WikiLeaks and the unprecedented peek behind the curtains of power they have granted us, the shadow government has been exposed to the light. 2008 wasn’t a smooth transition of power, it was silky smooth power consolidation. WikiLeaks’ variety of journalism – cold, hard, pristine truth – has more than ruffled feathers. The entire henhouse has gone mad. The ruling party are slavering at the mouth, and mainstream media has never been so easy to see through. Watch CNN’s Scott Cuomo, the same guy caught lying to Americans about their First Amendment rights, put himself in the running for a Razzie Award after the network pulled an interview with Rep. Chris Collins as soon as he mentioned WikiLeaks.

17 | Vickie Smith Wiles | 10154718910226336_10154718933591336 | These are the teachings of Saul Alinsky that Hillary Clinton and Obama follow! How do I know? I researched. I found that Obama wrote about Saul in his books. Hillary wrote about him in her thesis. Does any of this scare you?SPREAD THE WORD, maybe the right eyes will see this!! KNOWLEDGE IS POWER...to Hearts That Care. Share from my profile. The image attached to this, is a POWERFUL message. So please do not copy and paste. Make your voice count!!!•••••••••••••••••••••••••There are eight levels of control that must be obtained before you can create a social state:1. Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"! Wake up and Vote for Trump, he is our only hope to rid our country of the stinking rotten corruption!Help make our country great again,....I'm hash tagging #Made2HelpU Welcome to follow me 👀••CLICK ON MY PROFILE, to SHARE, if you care••

4 | Andy Charles | 10154718823906336_10154718839351336 | This country needs Hillary Clinton to win. We need open borders and millions of undocumented immigrants. We need to be racially divided. The police need to be regulated by citizens. We need to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. We need to raise taxes on businesses and the wealthy. We need to be hacked. We need classified information to become public. Children need to be taught that blacks lives matter more and that the police are evil. We need to ban guns. We need to have government run healthcare. We need to continue to pay for other nations. We need to support Iran. We need to let North Korea get away with everything. We need our youth to understand that straight white conservatives are evil and ignorant. We need to allow full term abortion. We need to focus on weakening our military. We need to collapse. The only way we can recover is to start over from ground zero. The pathway towards a collapse is to elect Hillary Clinton. If you vote Hillary, you are voting for our collapse. Democrats are a dirty filthy nasty group of liars and cheats. The emails and videos are 100% proof to how they operate. Hillary Clinton could murder someone on live tv and still win the election. The Bill Clinton rape tape could be released and the media would still only care about a private Trump conversation. This election is 100% rigged. The media needs to be controlled and regulated immediately. We need Hillary to win. We need a reality check. We are the old building that needs to be demolished for the new and improved one. You can't rebuild what is broken in this country. Hillary Clinton is going to be president and we get a front row seat to the fall of our nation.

6 | Debbie McCarthy Bell | 10154718823906336_10154718856001336 | So last night Hillary said it was “HORRIBLE” that Donald Trump said he would leave everyone in suspense on whether he would accept the outcome on election day.To call it “horrible” kind of annoyed me. Hillary, do you want to know what horrible is? How about 4 dead Americans who were left to die in Benghazi when you turned them down for help and then lied about it to help Obama get elected, or when a baby has it’s spinal cord severed and skull crushed to be thrown away in the 8th month of pregnancy, or sending people out to start riots at Trump rallies that injured people, or put our country at risk with the selfish attitude that you are above the law with a private server and then lie to the FBI, shall I continue.

17 | Bea Robinson | 10154718823906336_542236655986880 | You go Judge Jeanine. This lady can handle that big mouth Jeraldo. He has got to be the dumbest contributor on Fox.  He repeats what other people have said. No originality. He is someone I would not want as a friend. When damaging tapes were popping up he said he also had damaging Trump tapes. I notice he gave up on releasing them.  Hmmm, I wonder who got to him?
18 | Linda Ament | 10154718823906336_542235285987017 | Is there a reason Fox continues to have the bloviating, self-centered ambulance chaser, Geraldo, still on their Network? He is a big nobody and is trying to portray himself as someone with intelligence. Give your viewers a break and don't renew his contract.
19 | Jack Monaghan | 10154718823906336_10154718839321336 | JJ is so good she shouldn't be on FOX. Or? Fire Geradidiot, Juan, Me-ego and give Hannity and JJ their old shows. Otherwise? Boycott FOX and the Bimbo!
20 | Madeline Parquette | 10154718823906336_10154718870096336 | Geraldo is an idiot. I'm amazed he has been around so long. Surely, there must be someone available that can replace this empty package.
21 | Hector Gonzalez | 10154718823906336_10154718887081336 | Why don't they fire Geraldo Rivera! He is such an ignorant stupid liberal that it shows! He is always defending the Hillary Clinton Mafia even when they get cut red handed committing crimes and attempting to rig the elections! To me they are all a bunch of terrorists when they send groups of people, paid by them, to disrupt Trump's rallys! Inciting violence and in some cases assaulting and causing injuries to Trump supporters! Where is the DOJ or the FBI to investigate these cases? Are they ignoring the law on orders of Hussein Obama? What is Congress going to do about these abuses6
22 | Sara Remsberg Weitzel | 10154718823906336_853757968094611 | Judge Jeanine is the first person I've ever  seen to get Geraldo to be quiet... even if it is for just a few seconds!
23 | Vinny Buonocore | 10154718823906336_10154718844456336 | Plenty of evidence to arrest and convict these people! Where in the world is the FBI? Are they all, Clinton's and her entire group above the law?
24 | Elena Massa Maci | 10154718823906336_542206589323220 | Geraldo is a terrible burden to each show he appears on.  He is very hard to watch and listen to so i end up turning off fox.  Gersldo should b on cnn or cnbc but thwy dont want him.  Lol
25 | Tim Evans | 10154718823906336_10154718869601336 | This man is an absolute idiot incite a riot that's why you got smacked in the nose when you incited a riot on your show with the KKK & civil rights activist,you moron & it looks good on you today don't it, he needs to go look for Capone's gold again or something else stupid.IDIOT ALERT!!!

Incredible video shows a shark breaching a cage with divers in Guadalupe Island, Mexico. The shark and the divers escaped unharmed.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Justin Leck | 10154718565811336_10154718727336336 | Those divers must of knew something about Hillary CLinton
2 | David Steele | 10154718565811336_10154718734131336 | I always wondered why there's one huge rectangular space without a single crossbar. Now I know it's to give the sharks a chance.
3 | Kenneth Charles Frye | 10154718565811336_10154718763641336 | Really what it was...The shark was thinking. "These poor guys are in a cage. Don't worry, I'll get you out little buddy."
4 | Franklin Stout | 10154718565811336_10154718794666336 | Why won't Fox News cover the FBI stopping those 3 terrorist planning to bomb and even execute hundreds of people in America??? Where's the non stop fear mongering of terrorist? Where's the right wingers ranting about immigration?. Oh nevermind. Those terrorist were three white men. Fox viewers turn a blind eye to that.
5 | Patricia Holtzman Courchene | 10154718565811336_10154718801406336 | Why don't you just run this shark tape instead of the anti-Trump garbage you have been running over the past hour??? Every Clinton sycophant you have put on since 10AM has been spewing "opinions" that this election is already "baked" for a Clinton victory!!! Jeeesh!! I might as well turn on CNN. At least Tapper is willing to give an unbiased review.
6 | Christopher McGuire | 10154718565811336_10154718802346336 | Headline should say: "shark gets in cage with divers... For 2 seconds". Everyone always makes sharks out to be so bad, especially White Sharks. They're amazing , and have been here for millions of years... I guess we forgot that we're not equipped with Gills and its the sea of life territory!!
7 | Ed J Lewis | 10154718565811336_10154718979401336 | Fox news just showed part of trumps rally and said he said that if killary wins he will except it and while i watched it he never said he would the MSM just wants you to believe he did and at the end of the day of Nov. 8th they can play this as him saying it BUT the video is just part of what he really said
8 | Quincin VirtualReality Williams | 10154718565811336_10154718759026336 | I never could understand why that big rectangular hole was there in the first place. I knew that it would eventually happen, but with the result if someone being eaten alive ;-)
9 | Nathan Moses | 10154718565811336_10154719480381336 | I once went snorkeling and someone asked what to do if they saw a shark.  The instructor said if you don't want to see a shark, don't look at it.  😜
10 | Shaun Daniel | 10154718565811336_10154718746746336 | Here's the thing: sharks don't have hands so the only way they know what something is means biting and divers often wear bright wetsuits that look like some fish they eat. I've studied sharks since my childhood and would love to see them up close, but I also know the dangers of being in water with something that amounts to a boat with teeth. Many forget that U.S. submarines were aerodynamically patterned after the white shark and there's a reason for that, they are the best stealth predator in the ocean.
11 | Chris Williams | 10154718565811336_10154718733336336 | Why does the whole world know America's nuclear response time? Get her out of here thats classified information revealed on live tv with most of the world watching.
12 | Lee Czerny | 10154718565811336_10154718820096336 | The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey of Likely U.S. Voters finds Trump with a 43% to 41% lead over his Democratic rival. Five percent (5%) favor Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson,
13 | Marie Harrison | 10154718565811336_10154719023711336 | Made me think about what we used to say about Steve Irwin: "That guy's gunna get himself KILLED one of these days!"
14 | Mark Walton | 10154718565811336_10154719595321336 | I actually feel bad for the animal. They attract them to this area using chum and then the poor thing gets caught up in a metal cage. One day, and it will happen eventually, someone will lose an arm or  even a head...and the poor misguided animal will be killed on the spot. I'm not a vegan nor I condemn the eating of meat, but c'mon folks, have a little respect for nature.
15 | Berthold Gottschalk | 10154718565811336_10154718916946336 | Reckless Americans treat humans and animals like dirt. What's got into them? They Invade, bomb and kill and then call it an act of miscalculation! The World will be wiped out due to this stupid US error of judgement.
16 | Chance Durham | 10154718565811336_10154718731466336 | Excuse me sir, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior Poseidon?
17 | Carmen Nys | 10154718565811336_10154718727541336 | For open borders 🔛😱, women raped on the streets like it is happening in Europe 🇫🇷, porverty💲🔜 , no jobs 😰 , more crimes💣, sharia Law 👳🏾vote : Hillary Clinton ! ✌🏼️👸🏼
18 | Roger Lucas | 10154718565811336_10154718727436336 | At least the Shark survived just being around Human's.
19 | Tim Medlock | 10154718565811336_10154718756276336 | who left a big hole in the cage to begin with? surely somebody said 'you reckon a shark can get in here?'
20 | Lori Prinz | 10154718565811336_10154718729166336 | It's not even that big!
21 | Jimmy James Johnson | 10154718565811336_10154718875156336 | That's what happens when the opening to The Shark Tank is big enough for the shark to swim through
22 | Kevin Whitbeck | 10154718565811336_10154718786061336 | Ho do you know the shark escaped unharmed? He could have sprained a fin.
23 | Pam Turner | 10154718565811336_10154719341306336 | The shark was bleeding..not unharmed! Honestly, is this necessary?
24 | Keith Schelhammer | 10154718565811336_10154718879776336 | Thats El Chapo's pet shark just getting a little revenge....
25 | Trey Wagnor | 10154718565811336_10154718753831336 | ....aaaaand that's why you don't go cage diving with sharks. Just saying.

4 | Joni Alderson-Gibbs | 10154718486391336_10154718729246336 | Always cover their heads, it will help keep them calm and reduce your chance of injury and possibly more injury to the bird. I'm glad he will recover!! ❤️
5 | Lola Morgan | 10154718486391336_10154718649411336 | Wonderful gesture, animals.,birds, to me.are next important to humans. Animals,birds, etc are much more appreciative than a lot of mean mortals, just my own opinion, no reflection on mean mortals.
6 | Tonda Rae Silinsky | 10154718486391336_10154719986931336 | I picked up a sparrow hawk thinking it was someone's pet. I ended up taking it to Tappen Lake bird sanctuary. The keeper told me "lady that bird could have torn your face up! What a shock, but I felt good for taking it out of the road. I think animals know when you're trying to help!
7 | Raul Perez | 10154718486391336_10154719188936336 | It's amazing how hillary says the Russians want Donald Trump to win ,but it was hillary that did the "Russian reset" so if anyone is working with the Russians to ruin our country it's hillary! Remember when Obama told Romney that the 80s was calling well they still are!
8 | Robert Brown | 10154718486391336_10154718587776336 | The Mida said Trump was heckled at the dinner, but fail to tell you that Hillary Clinton was also Heckled. The Hecklers was members of the Media in the back of the room. Vote for Donald Trump For President It was a Roast so what.
9 | Robert Mansfield | 10154718486391336_10154718920171336 | Wait a minute , you mean to tell me that the United States government is keeping someone in prison not for what they did but for what they know ? That is equivalent to #NorthKorea ..! The NSA so called hacker as #FoxNews called him is actually a contractor for the NSA who took his work hone with him and no intent to distribute it or commit any crimes according to what James coney said about Clintons, just because he did it on a larger scale it doesn't change the nature . If they are going to imprison him they need to get #HillaryClinton and her aides and put them in prison as well .
10 | Curt Mckurt | 10154718486391336_10154719201151336 | Why isn't Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC, reporting what Donald Trump said about his own daughter? He was asked what's the favorite thing you have in common with your daughter Ivanka and he said "sex" and "if I wasn't married or her father, I would be dating her" and "she has a nice body" he's a disgusting pervert! What if Obama had said this about his own daughters? White America would try and lych him in the news!
11 | Kingston Hossa | 10154718486391336_10154718559866336 | The Eagle was part of Obummer's plot to destroy America with sharia law! It was a communist Eagle and this brave cop foiled his plan cause all cops are heroes in FoxNews!!!
12 | Jacquie Rice | 10154718486391336_10154718988446336 | Sources are saying Clinton campaign paying to have polls altered. AND it is not the Russians but whistle blower DEMOCRATS feeding WIKILEAKS. Hence,the increase of people committing apparent suicide
13 | Sue McKay | 10154718486391336_10154719065741336 | Obama missed one! That SOB took the bird off of the endangered list and it was open season to kill them, with no limits.OBAMA has no respect fir ANYTHING that is American:The bald headed eagle, a regal symbol of a our nation, killing them offThe American flag, doesn't raise his hand to salute it, nor does Obama salute the military that serve under it.

Once Trump is elected, animals will be used as the food they were meant to be, not pets or figure heads for countries. Trump 2016!!

Congressman Jason Chaffetz sent a letter to the FBI requesting all documents related to the agency's review of the alleged quid pro quo by next Thursday. 

"The FBI thought this information was not relevant... That is just stunning to me," Chaffetz said. http://fxn.ws/2dRKx0I

1 | Todd Mixon | 10154718344686336_10154718366666336 | Let me help you out on this one Fox, you want to know why Hillary is above the law? the Clinton foundation is nothing more than a tax shelter and slush fund for United States government, the fact you people harassed Trump for his tax returns and never criticized hers was obvious, especially when the tax payers pay her salary, this woman pays no taxes and lives off my tax money, the return on my investment is unacceptable and you're all firedt
2 | Becky Mitchell Hewitt | 10154718344686336_10154718369456336 | FBI and DOJ are as corrupt as any government agency beside the man in the white house. They will do nothing because Obama won't let it happen. In the words of Hillary, "Nothing to see here, move along."
3 | Michael Martin | 10154718344686336_10154718369926336 | "The Clintons"12 rapes46 mysterious deaths1 dead ambassador10 investigations 1 impeachment 2 disbarment 30,000 deleted emails Nothing to see here keep voting
4 | Deborah Jackson | 10154718344686336_10154718368131336 | This corruption is throughout all government agencies. Hillary cannot win or this crap will continue and worsen. This is evil at work in our government.
5 | Carla Gulisano Wittstock | 10154718344686336_10154718371361336 | It's stunning to all of us. The more evidence produced against Hillary, the more trash is swept under the rug. A wise man once said "the system is rigged"....
6 | Melody Davis Roberson | 10154718344686336_10154718379536336 | Why don't you just do an unannounced walk into these friggin offices and sieze everything...don't give them time...Isn't that what the FBI just currently did to the guy the NSA is accusing of stealing information from..........gosh...do the frigging job!
7 | Kenny Durbin | 10154718344686336_10154718368151336 | By next Thursday? So you gave the corrupt FBI an entire week to meet with Killiary and come up with more lies. Pathetic.
8 | David Webb | 10154718344686336_10154718370361336 | Remember when the FBI actually held up to the letter of the law and hunted down criminals? Pepperridge Farms Remembers.....
9 | Juan Villacis | 10154718344686336_10154718363311336 | As American hispanics, we are tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the fantastic Trump Strong t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/trumpstrong .And let's Make America Great Again! Thank you.
10 | Daniel Beddard | 10154718344686336_10154718364336336 | FBI, in keeping with the democrats standard, immediately destroyed all evidence with hammers
11 | Debra Fagerstrom | 10154718344686336_10154718419056336 | Next Thursday? Did you want them to gift wrap it for you too?  You'd think someone would just  go in and just seize it all unannounced.  18 days until election and you give them almost a week?  Give me a break.  Americans deserve better than that.
12 | William Haase | 10154718344686336_10154718377846336 | Hillary's 30 years "experience" should be her downfall. I lived in upstate NY, where she was Senator, two cities in upstate NY rank currently in the top 50 most dangerous cities to live. Trust me she is a nasty woman.
13 | Lee Hardy | 10154718344686336_10154718396376336 | “A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.”
14 | Kenneth W. Brooks | 10154718344686336_10154718399791336 | I just watched the Fox news interview with Chris Wallace and the first thing he does after having a respectable moderation of a debate is to attack Donald Trump over and over and never mention a word about the corruption of Hillary's Clinton. You want to say the f****** debates and the elections not rigged, I say b*******
15 | Kay Uhrlaub | 10154718344686336_10154718383421336 | It's obvious they're stalling. When they originally told the Oversight Committee they would provide the information "after the election," it became very clear.
16 | Thomas Roberts | 10154718344686336_10154718402421336 | Impeach lynch for lying she knows every agency needs security clearances..impeach Clinton to never be able to hold another job in Govt. for lying to congress that will take her out of running period
17 | James Harding | 10154718344686336_10154718396351336 | what good will it do to request a investigation of anything, we all know the FBI is part of the establishment now, They are all in with the corruption, There needs to be some outside independent prosecutor that will be honest, IF ANY SUCH THING EVEN EXISTS,We all know if Comey has his hands on it nothing will be done, all while they are locking our military up one after another for much less, This is a disgrace and the whole country can see the corruption there isnt even any point in trying to hide it any longer, it is so obvious
18 | Nit Thibodeaux | 10154718344686336_10154718399126336 | So much disappointment in our judicial system. Unbelievable the crimes that are being revealed and NOTHING is being done. Corruption so far and wide in our Country, it's nauseating! From the POTUS, FBI, Sec of State., just to name a few. What's surprising is that the Dems don't see it or don't want to admit it. Trump has been called so many ugly things, but one thing is sure....He is passionate about our country. No, he's not a polished politician, but a straight shooter who has been ostracized by his own party. He is a true patriot in my book because with all the BS that has been thrown at him, the biased MSM who have made fun of him and not given him a fair shake, HE Pushes on for our country. Anyone who doesn't recognize how much he loves our country and wants to bring positive change and expose the corruption that is crippling our nation really needs to take the blinders off. Trump/Pence is our only choice for positive, truthful change!
19 | Buddy Hulsey | 10154718344686336_10154718382871336 | Then go to court, pass a law that holds all funding until compliance. I've never seen such widespread defiant arrogance in the open in my life. In essence NO ONE IN D C has ANY POWER to do anything. TOTALLY IMPOTENT!!
20 | Teresa Steuer | 10154718344686336_1183672611682007 | The "pay for play" information was brought to light by Wikileaks. The FBI hid this info from the oversight committee. The big question is WHY????More scandals connected to Hillary, and it looks like there is more to come. How much does it take before the Clintons are put in jail??? The law has been broken so often by them, and anybody else would be in jail a long time ago. Corruption abounds!!!Voting for TRUMP!!!
21 | Chris Dement | 10154718344686336_10154718416286336 | More dog and pony shows coming right up. Endless hearings by a feckless Congress have added to the Mt. Everest-sized mountain of evidence, yet NO ONE has been indicted, impeached, or otherwise held accountable for their crimes. At this point, it seems obvious that Congress has been complicit.
22 | Paul V. Doty | 10154718344686336_10154718390861336 | I'm sure in Comey's paid off view, it isn't relevant and no reasonable prosecutor would need to examine the evidence, especially if they were seeking to give cover for his nominee.
23 | Renea Thomas | 10154718344686336_10154718405621336 | And you're giving them more time to destroy evidence or doctor it seriously this is such a gross injustice and shows just how corrupt our government is. Donald Trump is the answer he is the answer we need to clean up this mess allowed for so long he is the only one who has came forth to help and this country as whole can not turn a blind eye no more We must take our country back for our children's and grandchildrens sake.
24 | Barry Mahon | 10154718344686336_10154718412581336 | You people that believe that the Russians have any thing to do with this hacking, are IDIOTS. The only way you know that it is not the truth is because all of Washington is claiming that it's the truth. This is nothing more than the set up for our own government to use this as a way to say that we are under a cyber attack so that Obama can call for martial law and stay in power. The one thing we know for sure is that you can not believe a word that any so called elite from Washington. If they say it is the Russians then you know dam well they have nothing to do with it. Wake up people, they know Hillary is so far behind and all of their efforts to take Trump down has failed. After November 1st Hillary and Bill will be exposed for the disgusting human beings that they are, once that happens Obama will start putting this all in place so he can blame it on the Russians and stay in power. This is also why Hillary has moved 1.8 billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation out of the US, she knows if by some chance Americans stand up and Trump takes over as President, her and all of her cartel members will be headed to jail. Come on people you are smarter than this wake up, take our nation back. This is our last chance.
25 | Josh Amodeo | 10154718344686336_10154718443261336 | It's a wonder they haven't assassinated Donald Trump and if it's the Russians doing the hacking yes it may be against the law but everything Hillary has done is breaking the law to but if she didn't want all this to come out she should have never did it it's like my mom told me when I was doing bad things it's not if you get caught it's when you get caught and she has been caught vote Trump 2016

1 | Sam Morifi | 10154718213371336_10154718283286336 | Question: is it okay for me to support Trump even though I've never been to America? Was told that I shouldn't support him because I'm not American. I've been subject to insults and attacks, just because I live in Africa and happen to support Trump's campaign
2 | Harold Graham | 10154718213371336_10154718288361336 | Their is zero differences , between a vicious four legged animal and a vicious two legged animal that decides to attack an human being ! The outcome is that you or either going to be hurt badly or killed . To avoid this is all up to the one being preyed upon . One must understand that you have options . That's is why we have been blessed with the second amendment . Times have changed , never say it will never happen to you ! We have more two legged vicious animals on our streets now than ever before , thanks to the take over of our justice system by the socialist liberals agenda and Obama opening up the prison gates . My advice to you and every American , step up and purchase yourself a fire arms legally and learn how to use it well ! Our streets have become a jungle that have become unsafe for you and your family to walk down . And that is a proven Fact !

Wouldn't it be fun just to once say "screw you" to our ruling class? To be a part of a revolution against the establishment? Hillary = Establishment, politics as usual, the elite professional politicians, the green cronies who steal from the poor by driving energy costs up, Wall Street, Big Banks, you radicals grrrrrrrrr know that right?

We are the government and the will of this great country. The strife that is taking place within our society is a learning lesson that if we do not understand what it is telling us then we are at risk of all being enslaved by our thinking.

U.S. officials reportedly have expressed concern that Russian-backed hackers could try to undermine the upcoming presidential elections by posting documents purporting to show voter fraud.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Glenn H. Shelton III | 10154718177586336_10154718183881336 | This just in: U.S. citizens have expressed concerns that U.S. officials will express concern that Russian-backed hackers could try to undermine the upcoming elections by posting documents purporting to show voter fraud, to try and cover up the voter fraud they have worked so hard on.
2 | David Walker | 10154718177586336_10154718184746336 | Translation: They have proof of voter and election fraud so we have to get out in front of this and spin it so it looks like they made the whole thing up.
3 | Jeff Knox | 10154718177586336_10154718181461336 | Yea, I don't see anything suspect about this warning at all. And I seem to remember some chump telling Mr. Trump to stop whining about the election possibly being rigged?
4 | Cheryl Lea | 10154718177586336_10154718186596336 | Sounds like "authorities" are trying to do some damage control before the real voter fraud gets discovered. Dems have lied and cheated for decades. Nothing has changed there, except they are on the verge of getting publicly skewered for it.
5 | Tom DeMay | 10154718177586336_10154718188791336 | The officials are concerned about leaked documents showing fraud, but NOT the fraud itself!!! The "officials" only care about getting Hillary in, or any Democrat. Let's sign up some more dead people or fill in the mail in ballots for the elderly or non-English speaking people... Enough already!
6 | Diane Patten Havlik | 10154718177586336_10154718182896336 | they need to pay attention on who owns the voting machines They are trying to take the blame away from dems because of all the e-mail leaks. If they required voter ID it would take some of the damage away
7 | Giulio Braga | 10154718177586336_10154718183836336 | Russians won't be the problem... the problem is inside the Institutions!! come on! When your own government lies to you, and the media lies to you, and thr GOP has more to do with the Big Liar, what do you have left??? .....TRUMP!!! all the way!!!! #Trump2016
8 | Pete Sayek | 10154718177586336_10154718186451336 | It's funny that the same Dems that mocked Romney over his Russia concerns ("the 80s want their foreign policy back") are now so concerned over who gets to deal with them for the next 4 to 8 years. That's what happens when you vote like you are picking the next American Idol instead of looking at the big picture because "smug incumbent made me laugh". You deserve whatever poison you get now.
9 | Margrett Fels | 10154718177586336_10154718185866336 | If the US government is intent on defrauding the American public, let the Russians "Come on Down" and show us the proof.  Sadly, you could push the liberal noses into the truth, and they would neither recognize  nor accept it. Truth. A most valuable possession.
10 | Tim Lewis | 10154718177586336_10154718192721336 | I recently challenged a liberal college English teacher to have her class write a research paper on how free trade and illegal immigration affect poor white and black communities.  For the best paper, I was willing to donate $500 towards books and other supplies. She said that she would have nothing to do with my offer! Why?? I'll tell you why.. Her stocks are doing very well and they're doing so well because of illegal immigration and free trade. Meanwhile, everyone else is struggling to get a job, buy groceries and pay the power bill! VOTE TRUMP!! They are stealing our dreams and are willfully misleading their constituents!
11 | Curtis McDonald | 10154718177586336_10154718184996336 | This government is corrupt. There is evidence of dead voters, illegals voters... podesta claming all illegals need is i.d. people stuffing boxes for hiallry on tape... people on tape admitting they cheat and this government is only concerned about russia? Its a scapegoat, a distraction from real voter fraud from the cheating democrats!
12 | Derek Evans | 10154718177586336_10154718189216336 | Here we go. It's the Russians' fault. I don't believe anything U.S. officials say when it comes to defending, covering up for or colluding with Hillary Clinton. Fox News you wonder why you have slipped from a high of 10 to now a rating of 50 among Republican viewers.
13 | Greg KD | 10154718177586336_10154718189231336 | In other words, the govt officials know there is rampant voter fraud, and are afraid their dirty secret will get out. Denial is the first cause of alarm
14 | Justin Layle | 10154718177586336_1804187766493921 | Personally I'm glad Russia keeps doing this if it is in fact Russia @ least someone is showing how bad the corruption is. America doesn't seem to be too concerned with it. People keep buying into it, I have a daughter and strong female president wouldn't be so bad but I personally want a woman who my daughter could looked up to not some greedy corporate puppet whose gross misconduct leads to American lives lost and who is nothing but corrupt bureaucrat peddling snake oil to the masses. The American people who support her should be deeply ashamed with themselves.
15 | Curtis Willis | 10154718177586336_10154718230101336 | Oh such hogwash! Hillary's campaign staff has been revealed to be the source of the corruption and lawlessness in election fraud! Hillary's is the problem with the election process not the bloody Russians!
16 | Bill Ross | 10154718177586336_10154718199021336 | So the democrats are reporting that there may be fake reports of voter fraud from a fake hack that never existed to debunk the voter fraud that actually is happening.  Can you see our skepticism at this point because the whole system has been tainted, starting with the DNC, the FBI, and the State Department?
17 | Karen Bryson | 10154718177586336_10154718215776336 | Voter fraud is rampant with the democrats and Hillary, we don't need Russia to point it out! I have no doubt the Clinton campaign is behind this because they blame Russia for everything. Try looking in the mirror and see who is really to blame!!
18 | Danny Edward Bryant | 10154718177586336_10154718223801336 | I fail to see that anyone would buy into this poor excuse to sway voters who already know the extreme corruption in the White House. US officials you have no power over the beliefs of the American people any more and anyone who would believe anything you say has failed to keep up with the judicial system. The scales only tilt one way, that being toward the oligarchy in Washington DC
19 | Dino Spemoni | 10154718177586336_10154718198551336 | what is this Cold War 2.0 it's not the 80s and Russia is not our enemy anymore, why would they care about who wins. Funny none of these Dems cared about leaks and hacks when it was happening to bush.
20 | Andrea Kelley Martin | 10154718177586336_10154718214236336 | Of course we have voter fraud and it begins at the top with our current Administration.   Illegal immigrants, dead Americans, and probably every cat and dog in America are registered to vote.   Its totally out of control but even though we are in total election chaos we have to vote for our candidate anyway.
21 | Jenna Bulis | 10154718177586336_1774377299467059 | In Washington state you can ONLY vote by mail. If you are a registered Republican your mail ballot is red and if you're a registered Democrat then the ballot is blue- if there is no fraud, can someone explain to me why we have different colored ballots and can only vote by mail- there is no way to ensure our ballots are received. 🤔
22 | Barbara McFarland | 10154718177586336_10154718191386336 | Well I will say that the counties are sure on their way to voter fraud! I have 2 ballots. One in my last name for the past 6yrs and one sent to my ex husbands house with my old last name!! How many other people received 2 ballots  Fox News?
23 | Kay Comstock | 10154718177586336_789561241146816 | What US Officials, the Dem party, State Dept, the DOJ, the FBI????? What a joke! Anyone with half a brain knows the Dems are behind any voting fraud going on, not the russians !!!Please everyone get out and vote Trump or we will be stuck with her for 4 or even 8 yrs. God help us
24 | Welsh Jhoulys | 10154718177586336_10154718182001336 | I am going to vote for Open Borders!!!!! Open Borders for Energy!!!!! We should let Energy in (Openly) even if it harms low income Americans and further reduces their opportunities. And when they Protest we will use the Energy to blame Police.
25 | Johnston Anderson | 10154718177586336_1152507811509624 | Vote Hillary and we will see WW3. The democrats had demonstrated they cannot be trusted at all. This vote fraud is more widespread than we know and now they try to put a boggyman to try to frightened the common folks into voting democrats only I do not think the Russians will care to hack or mess up the US election, it is as messed up by itself But with all the wiki leaks about what the democrats been doing, Obama and Hillary is out to ensure their victory, legacy and dominant hold over the government. If the American people let the democrats win this round, democracy will die

1 | Todd Mixon | 10154718068711336_10154718083011336 | Would like to point out to America Technically Hillary admitted the election was rigged by saying Putin is using Trump to sabatoge the Democratic Party, when did informing the American people about corruption in our government become criminal? All she left out was the word "rigged", you can tell Hillary is lying when Trump criticized her in Wednesday's debate about losing 6 billion in the state department, she responded by saying that's been debunked and changed the subject, no details, explanations or sources
2 | Jack Ciri | 10154718068711336_10154718083406336 | If you have yet to make up your mind about who to vote for this November, please stay home. You clearly haven't been paying attention.
3 | Len Larsen | 10154718068711336_10154718084686336 | A vote for Clinton is a vote for the devil
4 | Jenna Cato | 10154718068711336_10154718094456336 | A bit off topic, but I would like to know why Fox News hasn't been talking about the fact that during the debate,  Hillary admitted the Wikileaks document authenticity when she claimed the Goldman Sachs speech was taken out of context? She then went on to "clarify" that she was talking about energy during that speech. That was a freudian slip proving that the Wikileaks are real,  and I haven't heard you guys reporting on that at all.. I only see you talking about Trump saying he may or may not accept the loss of the election...

6 | Nancy Robbins | 10154718068711336_10154718087856336 | I hope so..Brazile lied the other night and we all know she lied,  she couldn't even look up when lying to Megyn Kelly about her role in giving the debate answers. such a lying witch.
7 | Brian Filson | 10154718068711336_10154718094986336 | Oh my, wouldn't it just be great if Donna Brazile had to eat all her words proclaiming innocence yesterday and prove how big of a liar she is! If this does happen it just proves more corruption to the people. What makes this even funnier is that she said yesterday her emails had not been hacked 😂. I thank whoever is doing this for shedding some light to the American people of the corruption which by all means we should be aware of instead of the darkness they have kept us in.
8 | Denise Softshooter | 10154718068711336_10154718085436336 | Did you know that democrats started Slavery, Started planned sterilization of people of little means and color, they started the KKK, they started segregation, they started planned parenthood in "ghetto" cities to (get this) wipe out all people of color ...I was appalled to hear this information please watch my videos or go to Apple tV or fire stick and rent Hillary's America... this will blow your mind!

11 | Yvonne Johnson | 10154718068711336_10154718084816336 | who cares Fox news!  You already manipulated the election and Trump is losing so quit trying to get back your viewers by pretending you care about killary now.
12 | Cheryl Jeswald Rego | 10154718068711336_10154718096351336 | I always had heard how corrupt the Clintons were, but this is ridiculous. These Wiki Leaks have exposed such a web of deception, fraud, cheating, corruption,lies,  manipulation of elections, setting up people to sabotage opponents supporters, voter's fraud, their horrible view of Catholics, and evangelists. And there  is more, Lord help us.
13 | Amy Dice Ross | 10154718068711336_10154718094341336 | No one is reporting on it thought!!! Like we need a national press conference exposing everything so people can really see who the Clintons, Obama and our corrupt government is!!!!! "We the people" need to get out the vote like never before in history and take this country back again!!!!!!!
14 | Cheryl Wycech | 10154718068711336_10154718099231336 | A VOTE AGAINST HILLARY IS A:- Vote against the foolish, selfish, shortsighted, establishment Republicans fighting to maintain their power.- Vote against an immoral, ungodly Democratic Party. (To those who take issue with this characterization, don't forget that they booed God at their convention in 2012.)- Vote against an unelected, unaccountable, overreaching, out of control Judiciary that believes it has the right to reshape America.- Vote against the unethical, biased, lying and untrustworthy media. (We will never reclaim America until we reject their influence. They may be the single greatest obstacle to America's recovery.)- Vote against a weakened military.- Vote against a loss of national sovereignty and a one-world government.- Vote against open borders.- Vote against policies that enable radical Islamist terrorism.- Vote against the removing of our 2nd Amendment rights.- Vote against higher taxes.- Vote against Obamacare.- Vote against the redefining of marriage. (It is not too late to reverse this.)- Vote against abortion-on-demand, partial-birth abortion, and Planned Parenthood with its selling of babies' body parts.- Vote against liberalism and progressivism.- Vote against the silencing of the church. (Only the totally naïve do not see this coming quickly.)- Vote against revising our history and the loss of our Judeo-Christian heritage.- Vote against the politicization and exploitation of racism, and the polarizing of America.- Vote against the slandering and weakening of law-enforcement.- Vote against the politicization of the Justice Department, the FBI and other important departments of government.

15 | Steven Parkell Jr | 10154718068711336_10154718177406336 | Prediction: Donna Brazile will be the next to step down. Just like Debbie Wasserman Shultz had to after the wiki leaks revelations. That was the day of the DNC. This one will be before election day. You heard it here 1st
16 | Deb Gordon | 10154718068711336_10154718104646336 | Such a bad situation. But her supporters are so hell bent on focusing on their hatred for Trump with phony sexual allegations that they can't even see the truth before them. Are liberals that naive?
17 | Rebecca Cannon Novicki | 10154718068711336_10154718122966336 | Glad we at least have wikkileaks to expose the massive corruption in our government. Remember the good old days when we had a free press and actual journalists who would investigate and do that? So we have established an elite ruling political class above the law and a government run media turned propaganda machine, all that's left is to rig the election to officially elect Queen Hillary and our transformation to a third world communist dictatorship will be complete!
18 | Anthony Kailing | 10154718068711336_10154718147186336 | I've come to the conclusion that this wikileaks stuff makes no difference whatsoever,,, liberals are going to vote for Hillary no matter what damning evidence is presented,,, and we've seen plenty so far.
19 | Bill Fuller | 10154718068711336_10154718155481336 | I find it so funny that people have called "us" conspiracy theorist and sore losers for years and now "we" are being vindicated. The election process has been rigged for years. I truly believe that is why Gore acted the way he did when he lost. He was promised the election and it didn't work out. So the lawsuits and conspiracy theories began. They refined the process and got Obama elected right after the worst tragedy in America with a funny sounding Muslim name and a questionable past. Now they have promised Hillary and they never expected Trump to take off and be a serious contender. They are in full panic mode folks!!!!Keep it up!!!!
20 | Vini Cousins | 10154718068711336_668058613363127 | I'm a US citizen originally from Chile.  My dad, who doesn't speak English is here visiting, he watched the last debate in the Spanish channel (Spanish caption), he said every time Hillary spoke, the caption (translation) was very long, but when Trump spoke the caption was a few lines. I wonder why... Latina for TRUMP!!
21 | Paul Gerbi | 10154718068711336_10154718148926336 | Pay to play. Can't believe how corrupt our news media sources are. So much pro Hillary Coverage. Democratic liberals are so nasty...creating violence and riots at Trump rallies in order to win at any cost. If TRUMP doesn't win, this country is doomed.
22 | Marie DiTullo | 10154718068711336_10154718146956336 | The only problem I have with this WikiLeaks is that it ultimately will not affect Hillary ~ look at the history of the Clintons ~ it's a sad time for Americans when criminal behavior is untouched for some but others with lessor crimes get the max ~~~~ but worse is that the democrats don't care!! (JUAN) I cannot stomach you ~ if she looked you in the eye and spit in your face on the set in front of the cameras you'd say "oh, that's okay - she didn't mean it" ......
23 | Mathew Kindred | 10154718068711336_636572119854367 | Oh, no! Will these treacherous, terrible, Russians never stop terrorizing us? This is all so scary. I may need to find a safe space, so I don't wet myself!   Tasty pic, Progressives! Don't comment on the absolutely criminal content of your emails, condemn the messenger for shedding some light on your deplorable tactics :-)
24 | Wanda Horton | 10154718068711336_1255547324517759 | The Democratic Party have a long history of rigging elections. Lyndon Johnson had numerous dead people voting. The ultra "Christian" Jimmy Carter tried to win against Reagan that way but people were sick of his weak policies and more real people outvoted him. It is a known way of election tactics. It shouldn't shock anyone. I wish Trump had worded his statement better. Doesn't anyone remember the hanging chads that decided the first George W election?  I hope Trump wins. But just as Hitler blinded Germany, we as a nation led by media bias are putting on blinders to the truth. Hillary will probably be elected. But her hands will be bound by corruption to do anything other than the most vile of her plans.
25 | Deborah Ann Ortiz | 10154718068711336_10154718112026336 | Hillary admitted that WikiLeaks is legitimate by acknowledging that in the piece regarding the Brazilian bankers the readers needed to read the whole content to see she was referring to energy.

“You had a firebombing in North Carolina of a Republican campaign headquarters. Where is the FBI?”

Newt Gingrich asked why the federal government is not worried about protecting the civil rights on Donald J. Trump supporters.

1 | Hollis Howard | 10154717945101336_10154717951621336 | Hillary sells nuclear bomb material to Russia and Putin. Hillary endangers military lives with her reckless handling of National Secrets. Hillary announces to the world in the last debate our nuclear response time and you want her in charge of the military!! Are you kidding! As a vet she presents more harm to us than North Korea. She cannot be trusted with our lives!
2 | Jack Ciri | 10154717945101336_10154717953591336 | Someone in my household was watching the news this morning (not sure which channel) and their segment was called "Trump's Rough Week". I'm sorry, what? We have video evidence of Hillary's klan inciting violence at rallies, they're vandalizing GOP offices and more wikileaks releases incriminating Hillary, yet somehow it's Trump's rough week? I just laughed and turned off the TV, the media has no credibility anymore.

6 | John Nolan | 10154717945101336_10154717961781336 | Oh please! One, Obama would never investigate an attack on Republicans - or any Whites for that matter. Two, insofar as every single Liberal is concerned "Civil Rights" don't exist for Whites unless they're White women being "oppressed" by White men.The entire purpose of "Civil Rights" was to take from the productive majority in order to give the handout of special privileges to those eaters and takers with protected physical traits.
7 | Helena Isabella Hawthorne | 10154717945101336_10154717991546336 | When Trump wins this election by a landslide, I wouldn't want to be one of sHillary's big donors because they are going to find themselves under investigation. Afterall, what goes around comes around. If a Democratic president like Obama can use the IRS to attack Republications, a Republican president like Trump can use the IRS to attack Democrats. And that is one of the things they are afraid of.
8 | Pete Benton | 10154717945101336_10154717960956336 | Newt. The FBI and DOJ work for Clinton and the DNC. Why would they concern themselves with an RNC or American issue? I've never seen a level if corruption so deep as this one. This American injustice must be stopped at all costs
9 | Joshua Copenhaver Sr. | 10154717945101336_10154717968986336 | He should have said Republicans. There are some Republicans that aren't voting for Trump. Just don't want the media saying "It's all about Trump!".. #TRUMP2016
10 | Jason Haynes | 10154717945101336_879069175527674 | I can assure you if a Muslim mosque or the DNC headquarters had been firebombed, the FBI would be investigating. But since it was the Republican campaign headquarters, "there is nothing to see here". It makes one wonder. :(
11 | John Giordano | 10154717945101336_10154717970526336 | How dare Hillary come to the Al Smith Dinner and tell us we should all act in a sence of "Magis" a Latin word that means "more" or "better." It is related to Ad majorem Dei gloriam, a Latin phrase meaning "for the greater glory of God." Magis refers to the philosophy of doing more, for Christ, and therefore doing more for others. How can she use that phrase when released e-mails show she and her supporters distain for Catholic's and Christianity in general and her support for killing of the innocent especially late term and partial-birth abortions. Her arrogance is beyond belief.
12 | Billy Lee | 10154717945101336_10154717970746336 | The media is trying to control the election. They are in bed with the Democrats. They are totally focused on defeating trump.Period.

"We the people of United States in order to form a more perfect union established justice, ensure to the domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote to the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America" VOTE TRUMP on NOVEMBER 8th!!!

17 | Chris Johansen | 10154717945101336_1778736662366369 | A comment from internet:"Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn’t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, “Trump is arrogant.” My friend questioned if one man could make “that much difference in the world today.” To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, “Really, what has Trump done?”I said, “In June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.”As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ”At this point, what do you have to lose?” We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year—one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I’ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we’re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That’s your right. Just don’t ever say he’s not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh’s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise … and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase—they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America’s problem isn’t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it’s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they’re not simply the “silent majority” as you’ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them “deplorables.” The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year." From Be Forbes."Bebe Coe Bertino9/29/2016 , this is a copy and paste, and ne
18 | Jenna Cato | 10154717945101336_10154718085476336 | A bit off topic, but I would like to know why Fox News hasn't been talking about the fact that during the debate,  Hillary admitted the Wikileaks document authenticity when she claimed the Goldman Sachs speech was taken out of context? She then went on to "clarify" that she was talking about energy during that speech. That was a freudian slip proving that the Wikileaks are real,  and I haven't heard you guys reporting on that at all.. I only see you talking about Trump saying he may or may not accept the loss of the election...
19 | Celeste M Wuersig | 10154717945101336_10154717999556336 | The trouble Newt Gingrich talks about reminds me of the turmoil in the late 60's and early 70's when Obama's friend, Bill Ayers participated in bombings against our government. The big difference though is at that time the FBI was not corrupted and they went after him and other anarchists We survived those dangerous times but I'm not sure we will survive this unless Trump wins.
20 | Gary Vicki Browning | 10154717945101336_10154718014481336 | We believe we know exactly where the FBI is...bought and controlled by DOJ and Obama....if a democrat headquarters had been fire bombed..obama would make a personal visit with jessie the race baiter jackson to call for investigation..had one of hillary's rallies been stopped and violently attacked like Trump's in Chicago...the Jacksons and Sharptons would have demanded action by the FBI..in this case we believe that the FBI was told and is told to stand down...that's our truth.
21 | Sherrie Kivlighn | 10154717945101336_1811660315783210 | The main criminal in this mess met with Obama over 40 times. Obama started the racial divide now growing in America and his wife gives speeches saying 'whites' are the main problem in America. Really expect the FBI? And if this politicized extension of Obama did show up, really expect an honest, fair investigation?
22 | Michael Droege | 10154717945101336_10154717992971336 | I don't watch the news anymore. It is everything bad about trump. Yahoo front page everyday has Trump making faces or something that is not good . Killary is OK though. And it is everyday. I hope our smart voters can see through all this.
23 | Tony Russ | 10154717945101336_879099242191334 | Still waiting for James Comey to show up in NC Republican campaign headquarters to investigate the bombing. He must be waiting for instructions from Killary.
24 | Joseph Berry | 10154717945101336_879054702195788 | Have we EVER seen more blatant "looking the other way" by law enforcement agencies?...AND more voters willing to give another "4 yr. pass?"......WAKE UP AMERICA!...Things will only get worse with a continuation of the Obama constitutionally defiant policies. You don't have to love Donald Trump,..but he will bring in some good people for change,..and preserve our liberties as provided by said Constitution....Many have died for these rights,..don't give them up so easily.
25 | BJ Pooky | 10154717945101336_1811906829091892 | The FBI yeah right their dishonest too it is scary living in the USA and the FBI doesn't get involved because you are the Republican Party. I am so ashamed to be a democrat that I am changing my preference to republican   Guess that involves re-registration. It is an embarrassment to even say the word democrat

1 | Bill Downs | 10154717888356336_10154717903671336 | The good news would be the media doing reporting like some answers on Benghazi or Hilary's deleting 30,000 emails, were Nixon had to resign over 30 seconds of missing tapes or why she sold weapons to Syria or the six million she lost in the state department or the mishandling of classified documents she goes free while others go to prison. If you had answers that would be good news.

7 | Carolyn Clement | 10154717888356336_10154718099186336 | My fav way to eat m&m's is to put them in the microwave for about 45 seconds. That chocolate flavor just bursts in your mouth! So good!
8 | Adam Butch Hobbs | 10154717888356336_10154718307596336 | Beware the Useful IdiotsBy Saul AlinskyObama was influenced by the writings and philosophies Saul Alinsky, author of the book, "Rules for Radicals," and later by Frank Marshall Davis, with similar philosophies.Barack Obama followed the philosophies of these 'role models' throughout his days as a Community Organizer for ACORN, using tactics that appeared to some as 'shaking down' businesses in exchange for not branding them 'hate groups.'And apparently Obama is still following those radical rules today.Recall that Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Barack Hussein Obama writes about him in his books.How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?

11 | Janet Foutch | 10154717888356336_10154717962691336 | With the revelation of the recent actions of the fbi and the dnc it has become painfully clear that we have the government of a third world country! We have been taken over by a ruling regime. They have given us the false narrative that we are living in a democracy,however we are not! We hold elections that are a farce and mean absolutely nothing. The outcome is predetermined as is evident by the leaked videos we have been seeing. This is the same type thing we see in third world countries where there is a ruling party that takes over the country! The democratic party is disrupting the republican party's right to assemble, they are discussing ways to cheat on voting, setting election headquarters on fire, and the government and the fbi are doing absolutely nothing! They are not investigating. They aren't even talking about it! If this doesn't show that there is corruption all the way to the top I don't know what does.

They gave birth the shot the child in the head. Romania until the mid 90s did the same, look it up, don't take my word.http://madworldnews.com/hillary-abortion-remarks-fact/

Donald J. Trump hit at Hillary Clinton during the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner in New York, which raises money for Catholic charities.

1 | Michele Stein Kaufman | 10154716983716336_10154717784191336 | Just saw the clips on the news this morning, and I'm surprised one irony was missed when Hillary was making her speech. I'm paraphrasing, but she was explaining if Trump wins, that when he gets sworn in, all the living presidents will be there, including Bill. However, she said as clear as day, Barack won't be able to be there due to Trump's Muslim ban. Now, think about what she said and implied, because last I checked and had shoved down my throat, Obama isn't Muslim.
2 | Andy Croxson | 10154716983716336_10154717786386336 | Trump might be a lot of things. But what I love about him is that he is honest. Believe it or not, I think he is. And he is definitely running against the most dishonest politician in the history of the United States! There's no doubt who I'm voting for. #Trump2016#HillaryforPrison #RiggedSystem
3 | Bruce Mc | 10154716983716336_10154717795911336 | This was a ****ing masterful play by Donald Trump tonight.First off, every political pundit and person who watched was wondering if this was going to be anything but normal. This election, as everyone has said, has been anything but standard. It is easily one of the most brutal and controversial election cycles in American history, with this dinner coming not even 24 hours after one of the most brutal debates in American political history (as Trump himself said, not sure if they could top the Lincoln-Douglas debates).Donald Trump played it perfectly. He got to that dais and spent the first half of his speech getting everyone in the room comfortable. Keep in mind who his audience is: some of the most hardline democrats in the country along with the heads of the massive Clinton propaganda machine we call our news media. And make no ****ing mistake about it, the room was packed full of NYC elites. He got them rolling, dying with laughter. He showed great timing, well thought out jokes, and fantastic self-depreciation. Compared to Clinton, she looked lifeless and boring. In a room full of her biggest donors and supporters she struggled to get more than a few chuckles. Trump had the whole crowd roaring for 20 seconds at a time.Then the gloves dropped.Donald turned it into exactly what he needed to do: a bloodbath. We all knew it would happen, this election has been anything but standard and this light hearted affair was not immune.He used banter to disarm the crowd. And then he completely unleashed on her, not just with insults or accusations but with truth. Not only were the jokes still hilarious, they drove home the point of how corrupt, unethical and unfit she is, and she looked like a complete idiot by laughing along with the tamer jokes at the beginning, smiling like a fool. He implanted the seeds of doubt in the mind of any undecideds watching this, she is tacitly admitting to the audience that she draws tiny crowds, is bought and owned by her corporate masters, and has the entire msm shilling for her by laughing along with the crowd. It's like that moment when someone realizes the entire room is not laughing with them, but at them, and it was beautiful. Trump is a ****ing master.Do you think Trump was going to walk into a room full of people who have spent the past year and a half slandering, mocking, and viciously attacking him as a candidate and then sit and mock himself like some kind of pathetic jester? He got them comfortable, he got them laughing, and flipped it so ****ing quick the guy's eyes behind him about popped out. He walked into the den of wolves and gave them a huge middle finger, outing Clinton and throwing the truth right into their faces.

Why in heavens name are they allowing her ( late pregnancy abortion advocate...hell...any abortion period!) To mix with the devout crowd??? I guess some things have changed since my school days!  Oh yes...I voted for Trump!
8 | Annie Soto | 10154716983716336_10154717786216336 | GO TRUMP 2016. By tbe way our present Pope is more concerned with Islamic Rapefugees being welcomed than he is about Christians being beheaded. #NOTMYPOPE.
9 | Lou D'Ambrosio | 10154716983716336_10154717805636336 | Hillary sits next to Cardinal Dolan , yet she delivers speech after speech supporting 'last minute' abortions and the sale of the dismembered baby parts onto an open market . Keep smiling Cardinal.......they'll be coming after you next .
10 | Linda Crane | 10154716983716336_10154717794651336 | It is truly sad to see the democratic party fall apart as it has over the past 50+ years. The last two generations are clueless as what the democratic party use to look like in order to see it for what it really is today. They did not learn it in the public schools because they have ripped the truth from text books. They won't learn it from main stream media because most of them have a hidden adgenda and they certainly will not get it from government. BUT if you have really studied and looked at our true history and know how the democratic party voted agaist 3 of our sacred ammendments in our constitution. Wake up America. This woman is very dangerous for our country.
11 | Natalie Cainan Chandler | 10154716983716336_10154717817221336 | Where are Killary's clips from this event?? I watched it...she said some things far below the belt....people were squirming and she got booed as well as Trump. Air her clips, please!
12 | Lisa Swartz Harrison | 10154716983716336_10154717939711336 | I've never laughed so hard I've watched it over and over...I love how nothing that the media talks about like cnn on all her corruption they like to sweep under the rug he called her out on it!!!. Loved it.. get the truth out there on that sick corupted human her and her whole campaign is a joke who should be in prison !!!!!  TRUMP/PENCE 2016
13 | Bobb Nappaa III | 10154716983716336_10154717859531336 | This is a request to all my brother and sister Firefighters........A huge number of polling places for voting are in our firehouses. Have your people there to watch for voter intimidation and voter fraud. This upcoming election will be the difference between us maintaining our constitutional republic or becoming a democrat socialistic state.Our job as  firefighters is to protect the people in our communities and it's not just in fires !!!
14 | Patty Davis Lepore | 10154716983716336_10154717913836336 | Look at thoses faces behind Trump, rows of arrogant hypocrites  who are so detached from reality. It's about power, about status and believe me folks, they don't care about about the American citizen, or the struggling illegal immigrants who need a good law in place that helps them come into our country legally.  A vote for Hillary is another dollar in their pocket.
15 | Carol Smith | 10154716983716336_10154717870981336 | Why don't you ask Hillary if she will accept Trump as President?  That question doesn't get asked, but if she had to say yes, it would show women voters he's acceptable.  Put her on the spot!
16 | Tina Weaver | 10154716983716336_10154717984401336 | TRUMP did great !!!! He pointed out the Hillary Clinton following media and you could see that he was really getting under Hillary Clintons skin with him telling the truth on her. It made me sick to see them stand when she got up to speak and when she was done. To me.... that was like kneeling at the feet of the devil. She don't deserve to be honored, she deserves a 5 by 9 jail cell.
17 | Frank Caputo Sr. | 10154716983716336_10154717821246336 | Stop watching the media, without funds they will wither and die. Time for peer to peer communication as in Colonial times. US Media and government can no longer be trusted. Even the Pope has been compromised. If Hilary Clinton is elected we will never know the full extent of all crimes that the Clintons, Obama and their cronies have committed against the American people. We do know that these acts are traitorous in nature and have compromised the FBI and other intelligence agencies. If you support Hilary Clinton in this election you are aiding and abetting in high crimes against the American people and should be treated as such!! Do you know a Clinton supporter? Let them know how you feel. I will not talk too, associate with, purchase from or have anything to do with a Clinton supporter in any way shape or form. Do the same and they should get the message. Time to defeat Wall Street, as well as the Political and Media elite with one blow!! I'm an Independent and I stand strong behind Donald Trump!! TRUMP 🇱🇷 PENCE 2016!!Stop Americas destruction by liberal loons and Conservative power trips!

19 | Kat Meyers | 10154716983716336_10154717859251336 | I'm not even listening and can tell by the facial expressions on the people around Donald Trump that he must be hitting a nerve. They look very uncomfortable.
20 | J Scott Davis | 10154716983716336_10154717764871336 | Outstanding shot by Trump..... We voters will soon get our chance to stop political corruption as we vote Trump into office.
21 | Sharon Siter | 10154716983716336_690937397748018 | Fran Justus I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him.If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him.If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him.If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him.If he wanted my 3 year old Granddaughter to go to restrooms with men dressed as women, I would not vote for him.I have taught my daughter and will teach my granddaughter to disregard sexist remarks and move on, especially when they were made so many years ago and, also to forgive those who say they are sorry.If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him.If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him.If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him.If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the only person who does all these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump.
22 | Barbara Leonard | 10154716983716336_10154717860151336 | Fox is the only channel where any candidate is given a fare shake and have no problem calling out Trump or Clinton on what they say or do. The rest of the news media doesn't report any negative findings and dismissed most of them that concern Clinton
23 | Don McAnally | 10154716983716336_575036579356985 | I thought Trump went a little too far until Secretary Clinton showed what a seasoned politician she is. She gave as good as she got. The problem for her is Trump has evidence to support his remarks.
24 | Laura J Kushto | 10154716983716336_575032829357360 | Mrs Clinton is a bad woman, even though I am a democratic woman , I am not voting for her. Even though I agree with her on pro- choice and guns, I am not voting for her. I think there are too many wrong doings by her and the lawyers around her. When Clinton was president there were so many questionable court cases around them, which took the vision of our country away and keep the talk all about them, Whitewater. Travelgate, Filegate, and the circumstances surrounding Vince Foster's death. I sat in my home saying bad republicans finding instance just to make Clintons look bad, durning the eight years of his presidency but wow it looks bad for her now with all her crap, money is very important to her not people.
25 | Barbara Leonard | 10154716983716336_10154717837356336 | So Hilliard is back to calling Obama a Muslim. Didn't she defend him a while back? She said the only living president that wouldn't be there was Obama because of trumps muslim ban

Makes u wonder what they are trying to hide from us..why is Hillary not getting the same pressure.. She was never even asked this at the debate.
2 | Deb Smith | 10154716131626336_10154717670166336 | That was totally awesome. This man MUST win. He predicted his nomination and he was right. Now he's saying he's going to win big. He's usually right. If he is confident, so am i. TRUMP/PENCE
3 | JJ Armstrong | 10154716131626336_10154717671616336 | Every time they push and push to get him to answer a question, BAM! The next day something comes out against him directly related to the question asked the night before. He'd be stupid if he said yes, because we KNOW it is already rigged, but the sheer volume of people coming out in force and making our vote known on social media will not allow for shenanigans.

4 | Crystal Rogers | 10154716131626336_10154717677671336 | why are people flipping out over this? I would be the same way with everything that is now coming to light about voter fraud and the like. Why should he just accept it and move on if things look suspect? That has gone on for far too long and Donald Trump is not going to go down without one hell of a fight
5 | Sam Bradford | 10154716131626336_10154717696776336 | Hillary and the DNC rigged the primary against Bernie Sanders. Why was that reported as fact but that she could do the same thing to Trump is treated like a crazy conspiracy theory?
6 | Craig William Stiffler | 10154716131626336_10154717700451336 | That's the difference between Trump and the others. He's a businessman, he always keeps all his options on the table, he's just being honest, unlike politicians, who will tell you one thing to your face, then turn around later and do the exact opposite of what they said.
7 | Denice Qasonqa | 10154716131626336_10154717675241336 | As its hard to believe that USA this year will have a rigged election, don't blame Donald for not accepting the results because the democrats have rigged the primaries in Hillary's favour whats stopping them from rigging the election in favour of Hillary with the assistance of mainstream media,there is clear evidence of voter fraud committed by democrats and even caught on tape discussing it, its clear that the democrats will ruin Americas reputation when it comes to democracy, it will just be the same as our African countries, a rigged system.
8 | Rocco Lo | 10154716131626336_10154717713066336 | 800+ illegal immigrants were "accidentally" made US Citizens. Head of the DNC Debbie W Shultz was caught rigging the election against Bernie Sanders. And 2 videos were leaked by 2 Democrats talking about how the DNC rig the elections by "busing", and how the DNC stir up chaos at Trump rallies!  Yeah! I think we may be on to something!
9 | Adewale Daniel | 10154716131626336_10154717665851336 | That is true he as a right to contest if the election is rigged people that accept abortion and gay marriage should not now turn to moralist becacause they have never being.
10 | Carl Eberhart | 10154716131626336_10154717686091336 | This is simply meant to distract from the FACT that Trump had a good debate performance overall...it's dishonest reporting to say Trump lost the third debate.  And yet this incessant narrative is attempting to do just that.  THE DEBATE WAS A DRAW...but this is propaganda.  There were other more critical errors he made in the debate, this was not critical.
11 | Judy Lusk | 10154716131626336_10154717670611336 | The proof of voter fraud is in the pudding! Trump rallies-thousands...killery rallies- MAYBE hundreds. If Trump doesn't win, there's voter fraud, FOR SURE!
12 | Debbi Dalton Babin | 10154716131626336_10154717693086336 | Go Mr. Trump go!!! I'm not going to copy and paste like these people who comment do. Just know we love you, we're behind you! From Florida... you will win our State and you will win the Presidency!! We love you!!
13 | Lisa Meredith | 10154716131626336_10154717805666336 | For almost a year we've seen poll after poll showing Clinton was leading. At the same time, we watched rally after rally showing  thousands upon thousands of Trump supporters, both inside and out, whereas Clinton supporters barely covered the floor of the arenas. So I can understand Trump wanting to wait until after the election. Do we believe the polls or what we've seen with our own eyes? I would question it if she won.
14 | Steve Brown | 10154716131626336_10154717669331336 | We don't need corrupt Hillary, her and Obama gave billions to Iran, Obama even said how corrupt she is back in 2008 speeches go watch them on youtube you can clearly hear and see him talking about her corruption, she deleted thousands of emails and lied to the world about them....now they're leaking and you can see all the corruption with your own eyes!!! She said it's not fair cause she thinks Russia is hacking her emails haha of course it's not fair cause you don't want anyone seeing how corrupt you are!!!!
15 | Loren A Moore | 10154716131626336_10154717911556336 | With as many people I talk to that disliked Obama during his first term I find it had to believe he got elected for a second term.  I have had a difficult time believing that with all of the people that didn't want Obama back in office again that he still was elected for his second term. Personal experience makes me realize that not only are the elections rigged but the poles aren't accurate. We cannot believe the main stream media. Government dictates through manipulation what we see.
16 | Gregory Scott Kocjancic | 10154716131626336_10154717740006336 | No one in their right mind would say they are going to accept the results ahead of time, that is plain insane. Like you have the view of the future ahead of everyone. Again the media blows up the news grid about this and make it headlines. What about the info that Mrs Clinton said the night of the debate, you know how long to push the button. That info is confidential of what I know, well not now after she explained how long it takes to push the button. You can always talk about this, The issue on Americas Election in the next 18 days should be on everyone's mind and what does this mean for Americas future. This election is about; closed borders or open borders, stronger military or weaken military, who is fighting for our voice to be heard or who will benefit the Party elites, Immigration laws enforced or let everyone in, following laws or not following laws, protecting our constitution or destroying our constitution, trade laws that benefit America or trade laws that benefit other countries, common sense or no common sense, America first or One World Order and of course "We the Peoples future or the Political elites future. Case closed.
17 | Aaron Roeth | 10154716131626336_10154717878276336 | It amazes me that the very people who are corrupt still vilify Trump for calling out their corruption. We not only have Wikileaks to sort this out, but we have the internet where we can share all of this and discuss amongst ourselves. In the past We the People could never compare notes! This is the game changer! Voter fraud? Election fraud? They will deny it exists, but we all know the truth!!
18 | Ali Gaber | 10154716131626336_10154717670316336 | Mr. Trump's confidence and consistency and honesty are your weapon👌✋in front of this lady👎👩We are confident in you and crush the election👊💪 because you're going at a steady pace👏👏
19 | Tony Wiley | 10154716131626336_708251709332843 | When i hear anyone support, defend or will be voting for Hillary...I immediately know that this persons brain is not functioning correctly or they are benefiting from her financially somehow
20 | Raul A Flores | 10154716131626336_1220716367989586 | I have not seen any intelligence coming out of Donald Trump. The way he ran his campaign was very amateurish and self destructive. Where is the intelligence that people talked about it. The only quality I see is his thick skin, other than that, he seems to be a fool.
21 | Roberta Marye | 10154716131626336_708436769314337 | We are behind you Mr.Trump!  I wouldn't want or expect you to concede to the corruption and deception we've been seeing. I doubt even Abe Lincoln would concede under the circumstances. I've seen it said that you won't concede because you are not a gentleman. There's a difference between being a gentleman and being a complete idiot!!!
22 | Joshua Redhead | 10154716131626336_10154717939616336 | Out of nearly 319 million Americans who are HIGHLY intelligent, smart, honest and so on, it boils down to these two presidential candidates?? My TV wanted to commit suicide after the presidential debate.
23 | Jerry Love | 10154716131626336_708251442666203 | The man has been a scumbag in every way from day one. His supporters, low class. I was not the least bit surprised when he acts like a scumbag as he loses, nor surprised that his supporters support his unamerican, infantile tantrum.
24 | Jennifer Blanke Marshall | 10154716131626336_10154717879901336 | I wouldn't expect ANY candidate to give up their right to contest results, most especially when they have people on tape admitting to tearing up ballots or stuffing the ballot box!!
25 | Bangah Brooks | 10154716131626336_1220988301295726 | The only ppl that support him are mostly racists. Aint enough of those stupid mfkers in this country for him to win. His sissy asz needs to deal with this lost coming on the 8th.#clinton2016
