In this case, Clinton had it right.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Michael Friday | 10153996725445950_10153996740885950 | The DNC has created a false narrative when it comes to the emails. They're attempting to blame Russia as a deflection away from the damning evidence that the emails contain. Looks like Clinton wants to start another war that has nothing to do with our security. All the more reason why this former/recovering Democrat will not be voting for Clinton.
2 | Gordon A. Kelly | 10153996725445950_10153996745095950 | LOL. And those are some of the same intelligence agencies that were "confident" that Hillary didn't send classified emails over a personal server. There is no proof that the Russians are behind anything, but thanks to wikileaks, there is proof that she lied about the emails under oath.
3 | Welsh Jhoulys | 10153996725445950_10153996742850950 | This is a joke. Our government doesn't know if Hillary's Server was being hacked in real-time or if it was hacked at all. We only know they want to assume the best to protect the Political Insider.
4 | Jimmy George | 10153996725445950_10153996737320950 | Wikileaks has leaked more files against Russia than they have against Clinton. Bush, and Podesta combined. They're definitely not working for Russia.
5 | Chris A. LaMere | 10153996725445950_10153996733185950 | In this case Trump is Correct...Accusing Russia of having been the source of the leaks, (to effect the election) and that so many of Our experts said it was Russia...The Fact is that they have said, they think it was Russia, it appears to be Russia, it points to Russia, but NONE of them have come out and said it Was Russia... But keep trying... Someone might buy the B.S.
6 | Emma Sen | 10153996725445950_10153996746510950 | Somehow nobody seems to talk much about the Clinton foundation, it just blows my mind that a person running in a branch of the US government accepts donations from not only certain big companies but from other countries! How is that not a corruption? Is the argument is that those countries just want to help doing charity? Hm..
7 | Johnny Seely | 10153996725445950_10153996768970950 | Bull-shit all the supposed security experts know is that Russian software was used. Big difference. Might as well put blame on Microsoft or Apple because they produced the operating system the hackers used.
8 | Theresa Marie Williams | 10153996725445950_10153996771220950 | The fact is as much as Hillary talks about Putin and the problem about National Security she is the one who caused the problem in the first place. "Extremely careless with classified information".  Not listening when she was told not to have a private server.
9 | Eric Rabinowitz | 10153996725445950_10153996749175950 | Russian state hackers don't leave a calling card behind to be found so they can be outed later. The fact is, nobody knows who it was. But what difference at this point does it make? The emails are authentic and prove Hillary Clinton and top Democrat Party leaders as far up as Obama engaged in illegal acts.
10 | Gary Eckman | 10153996725445950_10153996745345950 | Trump Lying again. We all know it was russia. Even Putin knows. Trump is given briefings that tell Trump. HERE is trumps problem:Trump is a Racist FOOL. But at least he is a rapist(molester) too. So hes more than just a bigot, hes a Russian loving fat pig also. Many people are telling me he is going to lose, because they hate rapists. I think he will lose because people tell me he is a Failure. SAD. Everyone feels Trump is a Loser. He hates Fat women. He only molests(rape) the thinner ones. He is a PIG! He LOST. But he may still have his coke, Thank God. Jesus would never vote for Trump. Ever. People that are Christian Know this. They have been saying Trump is a disgrace. Many agree.
11 | John McAuliffe | 10153996725445950_10153996733850950 | No, even the white house spokesman said there is no evidence to back up the claims. Just because the US is now officially assuming it is Russia, doesn't make that assumption correct.
12 | Tom Moodster | 10153996725445950_10153996733090950 | Did she not give national security secrets away in her statement of how long it takes to push the button for nukes
13 | Robert Gottlieb | 10153996725445950_10153996735630950 | Who cares who is behind the Wikileaks emails it is the content that the American media should be focused on. Never in the history of American politics has a candidate been caught in so many lies and deceits. No I'm not talking about Donald Trump I speaking about Hillary Clinton and the Wikileaks emails scandal. Never before in the history of American politics has the news media been provided so many facts and communications from the secret files of a campaign that show what a candidate is really thinking and doing. Yet the media has all but ignored a treasure trove of stories and facts in order to concentrate on the candidate they don't like. The media in America has done the American voters a major disservice to say the least by not reporting by an large on the Wikileaks email release. Hillary Clinton continues to poll around 45% a historic low for a leading nominee for the presidency. She cannot muster a meager 50% share of the voting public and the media has also failed on this story.
14 | Stephie Belle | 10153996725445950_10153996744885950 | In this case Trump has it right. Clinton is behind paying for people to cause violence at rallies.
15 | Charlie Ragusa | 10153996725445950_10153996745020950 | The people that told us Saddam had WMD are now telling us that Russia hacked us?
16 | Gary Doan | 10153996725445950_10153996742225950 | Trump mentioned a video. I watched it after the debate. The Veritas undercover video may be the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent, mentally disturbed, homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. Hillary blamed Trump for the violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country. The video is higher quality, real people boasting about committing crimes and their criminal network, with names, titles and ties. Watch it if you doubt it, it has gone viral on youtube. Millions watched it in 2 days and going up fast. Clinton did not deny it, she changed the subject. The second video in the series has almost 3 million views in one day.
17 | Vinnie Gazzara | 10153996725445950_10153996731275950 | CBS...like the Democrat Party, is a terrorist organization.
18 | Charles Gardner | 10153996725445950_10153996740305950 | Hillary has lied, stole, cheated....shouldn't be on stage‚ùå‚ùå‚ùåHillary is a lying untrustworthy crook...and already lost‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå
19 | Sophia Blandings | 10153996725445950_10153996750330950 | Donald Trump is authentic and honest. Clinton is a globalist tool, liar and criminal. SAVE OUR LIBERTIES VOTE TRUMP üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
20 | Stan Kappus | 10153996725445950_10153996752565950 | The focus SHOULD be on the content of the emails, but our beloved biased media won't have that.
21 | Mary Ann Sperandio | 10153996725445950_10153996765735950 | Gee, I wonder why we don't have any wikileaks about the RNC.  How could I forget, they are perfect I guess.
22 | Eileen Marie | 10153996725445950_10153996749460950 | CBS- Clinton Broadcasting System. All I have been seeing is anti Trump from this network all morning.
23 | The Truth is Here | 10153996725445950_10153996726905950 | Dear person reading this,I hope your day has been going well, if not, I hope it gets better You are an amazing person who will inspire others to do great things so keep up the hard work. FOLLOW US TO LEARN THE TRUTH !

Did Donald Trump say "bigly" or "big league"? The internet wants to know.

1 | Cookie Mabry | 10153996685235950_10153996701820950 | Biased pigs...that is what CNN, ABC, CBS, ALL the media are now.  You are are in for a rude awakening if the old witch wins.
2 | Pam Thorson | 10153996685235950_10153996730400950 | I LOVE the fact Donald isn't scripted!! This is what we're looking for ! A change from mrs slick with her "prepared" little speeches!Do you suppose she "laughed and pivoted " per her script??What a loser this woman is !!
3 | Rick Ustler | 10153996685235950_10153996721600950 | Donald and his eighth grade grasp of the English language has people hung up on bigly. Maybe your time would be better spent googling psychopath.
4 | Cindy Fuller | 10153996685235950_10153996743355950 | He was saying Big League but stopped short to say something else. Boy I feel sorry for this Nation when the only thing they can do is pick at a word/phrase instead of focusing on the real issues! We have people going to the polls that believe everything that is told to them by the MSM that is paid for by big money and special interest. They only care about what you can do to create more wealth and power for them. They do not care about anyone out of their class. It is funny that I hear Hillary calling Trump a puppet, saying that Trump supports espionage by not condemning Putin for the theft of her emails, and that Trump and Putin are in it together. When is she going to admit that she should have never written them? When is she going to quit inciting the crazy little dictator, Putin. When is she going to admit that she is the Puppet for foreign corporations and special interest groups?
5 | Robin Barron | 10153996685235950_10153996692135950 | Hillary made me boiling mad when she was arguing with Trump about abortions late term for health/life of mother. What you would do Late term, would be to do a C section or induction for health of mother and child. NO NEED FOR ABORTION for health/life of mother!
6 | Wanda Upton Watkins | 10153996685235950_10153996695700950 | We want to know.....You have the right to know the truth. Demand NBC, ABC AND CBS Address and report on this. The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country.
7 | David Hughes | 10153996685235950_10153996700750950 | BEIJING, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte announced his "separation" from the United States on Thursday, declaring that it had "lost" and he had realigned with China as the two agreed to resolve their South China Sea dispute through talks.........................thanks Obama and Hillary , we loose another ally.
8 | Sandy Miller | 10153996685235950_10153996723070950 | Suppose that every day, ten men go out for a beer and the bill for all ten comes to $100.If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.The fifth would pay $1.00The sixth would pay $3.00The seventh would pay $7.00The eighth would pay $12.00The ninth would pay $18.00The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.00So that‚Äôs what they decided to do. The men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve.‚ÄúSince you are all such good customers, he said, I‚Äôm going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20.00.‚ÄúDrinks for the ten men now cost just $80.00The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes so the first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free. But what about the other six men ‚Äì the paying customers? How could they divide the $ 20 windfall so that everyone would get their ‚Äúfair share?‚Äù They realized that $ 20.00 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody‚Äôs share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer. So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man‚Äôs bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay!And so:The fifth man like the first four, now paid nothing ( 100% savings).The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% savings).The seventh now pay $5 instead of $7 (28% savings).The eighth now paid $9 instead of 12 (25% savings).The ninth now paid 14 instead of 18 (22% savings).The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).Each of the six was better off than before! And the first four continued to drink for free.But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.‚ÄúI only got a dollar out of the $20‚Äú declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man, ‚Äúbut he got $10!‚Äù‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs right, shouted the seventh man. ‚Äúwhy should he get $10 back when I got only two? The wealthy get all the breaks!‚Äù‚ÄúWait a minute,‚Äù yelled the first four men in union. ‚Äú We didn‚Äôt get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!‚ÄùThe nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.The next night the tenth man didn‚Äôt show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important.They didn‚Äôt have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!And that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how our tax system works.The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore. In fact, they might start drinking overseas where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.
9 | Cindy Fuller | 10153996685235950_10153996694495950 | When the question of planned parenthood came up Trump should have cited the fact that they were selling baby parts for their profit!

13 | Darlene Kreuzer Lewis | 10153996685235950_10153996721005950 | Your "white grievance" campaign didn't work. Do you know why? Because white people are not victims in America. You are a loser Trashy Trump.The people you could not give a shit about are now your fans. The people you want to respect you think youre a criminal and a clown.Go home. Here's an idea - maybe spend your last years actually being a parent to your 10 year old son. Psssst, that's that short guy that lives with you.
14 | Shane Snyder | 10153996685235950_10153996700525950 | It's "big league"... but, it's okay. I understand. It must be difficult to hear with your head so far up the DNC's ass.In the meantime, remind us: why is CBS still not reporting on democrats admitting to voter fraud and voter intimidation?https://d1sb17b1leotpq.cloudfront.net/rigging-election-%E2%80%93-video-ii-mass-voter-fraud.html
15 | John McAuliffe | 10153996685235950_10153996689520950 | big league. It was pretty clear
16 | Donna Haddad | 10153996685235950_10153996709215950 | There is no such word as bigly....it's big league.  Time for a hearing test if you can't discriminate sounds.
17 | Karen Barone | 10153996685235950_10153996748740950 | I heard it as bigly. May not have been because of his habitual sniffling. Is the man sort of breath?
18 | John Lawrence | 10153996685235950_10153996729230950 | And the MSM just keeps on going!  True journalism is dead.
19 | Tracy Smith | 10153996685235950_10153996733885950 | It's like "embiggen" from The Simpsons. hahahaha

21 | Gary Eckman | 10153996685235950_10153996747320950 | He says bigly because he is ignorant and deplorable. He can say bitch and Pus#y just fine though. Sexual predator Trump!
22 | David Hughes | 10153996685235950_10153996701545950 | Hillary did not deny they had protesters disrupt trump rallies......
23 | Lorenzo Mateo | 10153996685235950_10153996746550950 | He said bigly. He's was sniffing again last night . Trump was on drugs.

1 | Mike Herod | 10153996634255950_10153996643795950 | Hilary is declared to be incompetent with national security; BUT, not a criminal by the FBI, a few hours after bill and Loretta meet secretly. Hilarys sheep accept this willingly but draw the line at rigging elections. Heh! Sheep –Ø Stupidüòú
2 | Kim Utt | 10153996634255950_10153996645755950 | She lied in front of the entire country about Trump being the ONLY presidential nominee who didn't show is tax returns, WRONG! Gerald Ford didn't either! What a joke!
3 | Tami Bissett Harris | 10153996634255950_10153996650030950 | Clinton News Network how about a headline that say Obummer has done that his entire presidency blaming it on Bush. How about the headline that the video evidence out that the DNC has broke laws for their own agenda. Nope you cant do that because that would deplete your money flow from them.
4 | Sheila Orthel Thibodeau | 10153996634255950_10153996656330950 | Shame on you...trump dud not refuse to accept if he lost..he said he will let people know...never said refused...there's proof that hillary clan paid people to go to trumps rallies and incite violence..chaos. video proves this FACT...and video saud they were paid by dnc...everyone needs to look it up..hillary said behind closed doors to her big donors..her dream is to have open borders...just that will turn this country upside down..this country cannot afford  600 million into this country..which will bring terrorusts..gangs..these people that were targeted by the paid protesters should sue...that is attack on democracy...the people that were on this video has been to the whitehouse  dozens of times...
5 | Richard Main | 10153996634255950_10153996651230950 | Hillary's 'plan' in a nutshell: tax the rich. Great plan. Been going on for decades. The rich pay a higher percentage rate than any other tax bracket in america, and our corporate tax is one of the highest in the world. She says that she wants americans to be successful, but if you do become successful, her plan is to punish you for doing so. No wonder everyone is taking their business elsewhere, and more and more people are just giving up and not trying to succeed. Just claim you can't make it, and get your free handout.
6 | Melissa Ruthven | 10153996634255950_10153996643590950 | Meanwhile...Hillary is being told what to say....puppet who? Clinton puppet

8 | April Delalo | 10153996634255950_10153996649350950 | I hate Hillary with a passion, but at least she was prepared, nuanced and coherent last night. Trump was like watching a kid try to fake his way through a book report for a book he never read.

Have a mind of your own. Our system is broken. The machines used for voting are rigged. Research, Educate yourselfs, but realize when you do you just might not like what you see. The curruption is wide and deep and until it affects your life you can choose to be blind. "Presidential" image... what is "Presidential" image.... ethics, morals, cultural upbringing, environmental surroundings of an individual's life determine ones view. Do you have a mind of individualality or do you ride the band wagon? Not just for ourselves, for our children and generations to come we must seek change.... the system we have harms the innocent and allows the corrupt to run free with no ramifications for their actions. A lawyer can be a lier who twists and spins words. Business man who is driven to make changes. Wealth doesn't mean currption. Follow the law. If you don't like our law then vote and create change. Create change one individual at a time. You do matter, your opinion matters, your life matters. #createchange

13 | Joseph Richard | 10153996634255950_10153996718540950 | Umm, what responsibility did Hillary take for any of her actions??  Everyone jumping on Trump for this has he has SAID, but where is the outrage for Hillary and the things she has DONE??  I would rather take an unpolished, shoot from the hip, slightly offensive man who may actually be able to actually change things, then some well-spoken politician. At least Trumps "blunders" are transparent, everyone can see them and he gets called on them.  Hillary's, on the other hand, are all behind closed doors, on secret servers, or covered up by the media.  So Hillary puts off a more refined image? Who gives a shit? Do we want someone who will get shit done or someone who will look nice while they destroy us. Remember the story of the wolf in Sheeps clothing??  That's what we have with Hillary. With Trump, we know he's a wolf, he doesn't hide it. We know he's not a political dynamo, nowhere near politically correct, and has a non politician past. We can accept that. Actions speak louder than words, and he may say a lot of things have people don't Agree with, but Hillary has DONE worse. She just "can't remember"

16 | Grete Pete | 10153996634255950_10153996701555950 | he has never been a Politician so WTF is this Marxist talking about. When he was Governor he took no responsibility for anything but spending money. As a Senator, he votes 96% with the Obama Horrible Doctrine. Can you imagine this turd in charge of this Country if something happens top Hillary? This Hole Government is so Corrupt. DRAIN THE SWAMP.
17 | Trent Dodson | 10153996634255950_10153996710590950 | THe thought of Tim Kaine as our president is frightening, and it is a real possibliblity seeing as how Hillary is suffering some sort of neurological disorder.
18 | Wanda Upton Watkins | 10153996634255950_10153996696780950 | You have the right to know the truth. Demand NBC, ABC AND CBS Address and report on this. The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country.
19 | Gregory Campana | 10153996634255950_10153996742885950 | I don't know how about the E-MAILS that you can't answer for other than it's the RUSSIANS, I mean if the Russians whanted anybody in it would be HILLARY they have already proved that she is a baffon, and can be bought PROJECT VERITOS, was product by one of you own and was fired for it
20 | Keishelle Achong | 10153996634255950_10153996679830950 | Well The rest of the world don't have to worry. The whole world knows, Trump hasn't contributed any taxes for border security, for our US Military to fight and protect our country and embassies and etc. But, I bet other US citizens did! Trump and his followers, "Let's make [Russia] great again!" How American? Lol hypocrites
21 | David Hughes | 10153996634255950_10153996707655950 | Hillary is not legally allowed to run for president. by FBI own words she lied and had secrets on her computer. they should already have removed her top security clearance and not be able to return it to her.
22 | Henry Commons | 10153996634255950_10153996721460950 | What about Hillary and William? Awesome. Two professional politicians fuck up for decades blaming other people, including those the Clinton's raped or murdered.
23 | Gary Allen | 10153996634255950_10153996690200950 | Coming from the campaign that blames the Russians for every bad email they have ever sent.
24 | Charles Gardner | 10153996634255950_10153996637160950 | Hillary has lied, stole, cheated....shouldn't be on stage‚ùå‚ùå‚ùåHillary is a lying untrustworthy crook...and already lost‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå
25 | Mazeppa Frenzy | 10153996634255950_10153996637220950 | hillary talked about America's top secret confidential nuclear response time on national television !!!--- Is she gonna take responsibility for her "carelessness "

When asked whether he would accept the outcome of the election, Trump said he would "keep you in suspense."

1 | Jorge W DeQueiroz | 10153996594075950_10153996598250950 | Everything that comes out of hrc's mouth is a lie (emails, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Haiti, clinton foundation, you name it). No trust in hrc, msm and cronies. Have to closely follow the voting mainly when hrc is running for president together with her record of evil doings. What BO/HRC have done to Chelsea Manning, Snowden and Assange show we have no rights and freedom of the press and speech. We live in a totalitarian State of a kleptocracy that blames all our problems on Russia in public and in private settles uranium deals with them.I'm no great DT fan but the allegations of outright msm pro-hrc PR campaign and avoidance of hrc's destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice, lies and scandals published by Wikileaks which are far more grave make me certain that the only way to see the truth is to alternate power.
2 | Sandy Gurski | 10153996594075950_10153996611935950 | Don't blame him. Trump is for America. He put up a lot of his own money to run his campaign to win so he can clean up Clinton & Obama mess. Why would he accept it if a person who belongs in jail wins?
3 | Charles R Jones Jr | 10153996594075950_10153996657140950 | I find it hilarious that the Democrats and their supporters will take ideological offense of Donald J. Trump not accepting the election results as an assault on our American election system fueled by a corrupt media, while they are stepping on and burning American flags or sitting, kneeling or not showing up for our "The Star Spangled Banner"!Oh the hypocrisy!!
4 | Mary Purdie-Cravens | 10153996594075950_10153996619285950 | These comments are the perfect example of what is really going on. The majority of comments at this point on this are pro Trump. Do u think CBS will admit to that? I think not. And Trump is right not to commit to answering the validity of the election at this point. There are 3 spoilers mcmullin Johnson and Stein purposefully staying in the race when they know damn well they can't win shit. Which equates to votes votes votes, u have a GOP being wishy washy in their support of him, Mike pence is battling voter fraud in Indiana, and let's not forget the accusations of dead people voting! Tapes of the Democratic party paying people to disrupt Trump rallies. So yeah he is absofuckinglutely right by withholding an answer to the question of is this election rigged!!!
5 | Richard Main | 10153996594075950_10153996657880950 | There is plenty of mounting evidence that the polls are not fair or accurate. I'm no trump fan, but he is correct in that regard, and also about much media bias.
6 | Tom Davis | 10153996594075950_10153996743320950 | I hope he demand's a manule count of votes because there is more wanting him than her , but no one will know that through the media . This is why you don't realy see add's from Trump they have all been bought off . Prove me wrong .
7 | Lacey Quartermaine | 10153996594075950_10153996627230950 | You do realize that when people are saying "rigged" they are not talking about ballot boxes and voter rolls. They are talking about a media system in which honesty and fair treatment among competing views and ideologies is not present. A system in which one candidate receives consistent negative coverage and other receives special treatment and negatives (uh...Wikileaks) is completely and utterly ignored.
8 | Karen Elizabeth Hunt-Maddry | 10153996594075950_10153996629700950 | He did not say he would refuse to accept election results. He said we will wait and see. Who can blame him. We have dead people and illegals voting, voter fraud, ballots being destroyed by postal workers, Trump headquarters being firebombed. He's entitled to say, we will wait and see.
9 | L Franklin Hawkins | 10153996594075950_10153996657465950 | Who gives a s--- what he accepts? It's not up to him! He needs to get over his delusional narcissism and study the meaning of the word treason and the implications involved!
10 | Rose Kelly | 10153996594075950_10153996633575950 | He gave an honest answer. You can't fault him for that, especially in light of recent WikiLeaks and speculation about voter fraud. Democrats are against the bare minimum of even requiring valid ID to vote, so how can we be sure of who's voting legally? Donald Trump is not the only one questioning this.
11 | Gregory Coffey | 10153996594075950_10153996730355950 | Most of what happens after this election will be the medias fault ,propaganda is not a fair and neutral part of journalism most of the blame will be on the MSM .Look at what you were bribed to do to our country, we know who and what you are .I know the management there does not give a damn about truth or corruption, your rabid support of Clintons is proof.The lack of coverage of Trumps rallies the barrage of attacks on him shows the bias daily.
12 | Didi Karn Phillips | 10153996594075950_10153996773025950 | Why should he if it's rigged. It's a non issue right now. Did the Dems contest the hanging chad in Florida 2000.Why would anyone think elections are rigged? I'm mean it's been a few months since Hillary rigged the Democratic primary, but whatever.
13 | Todd Murphy | 10153996594075950_10153996599895950 | Assad refuses qatar natural gas pipe line through Syria, In case anybody was wondering why the powers that be want to overthrow Assad. Who benefits from this pipeline you ask? Saudi Arabia/Turkey/Israel,France,United Kingdom, all U.S. allies. Who does not benefit from this pipe line you ask? Russia, whom currently supplies most of western Europe with natural gas.Again boiling down to the petro dollar & the Central Bank. Oddly enough Aleppo is in the path of the proposed pipeline. COINCIDENCE? It would sure make it alot easier to build a pipe line through an already leveled city. Expect more of these crimes against humanity with a Clinton win. Buisness as usual. A vote for clinton is a vote for Goldman Sachs/Rothschild/Soro's & all the globalist elite. There will be election fraud. You can bet your petro dollar on it.
14 | Dean Haas Jr | 10153996594075950_10153996634400950 | He said 'let's wait and see' in response to the video of the DNC operatives, now fired, explaining how they fix the election. He will accept once he's sure it's legit.  Stop twisting his words around.
15 | Sheila Lee | 10153996594075950_10153996679770950 | A better question is, "Will Hillary accept the outcome of the election?"  She's so detached from reality that I'm not sure she'll comprehend her loss.
16 | Jennifer Schilling | 10153996594075950_10153996600660950 | Most Americans are following Donald Trump, yes he said a few bad words, but don't tell me that you men and many woman have never talked that way. Until he ran for President I had never heard one negative thing about him. He is known for his keen business sense, his charity, his clubs that are open to all people, and his remarkable family. Killary is a criminal, a pathological liar, a murderer and a proven failure for 30 years. This is a very important election, educate yourself think of the Supreme Court for one, then open borders, think about your tax money going supporting undocumented illegals that Killary said that she cannot vet. The establishment is desperate to keep him out, they have become a cesspool protected by their own laws. May I suggest a few outlets to the truth: FB: Dennis Michael Lynch, Lou Dobbs, Allen West, Scot Baio and Hannity. Look at the Wikileaks. Educate yourself and your decision will become  very clear. Americans their country back, America wants and needs Trump ! The liberal media like CBS here is so full of crap, they are bought and paid for by the Clinton crime family!!!!!
17 | Jared McManus | 10153996594075950_10153996689785950 | Good for him. Nobody should accept the outcome of a rigged election. We the people see through all the lies and corruption. How can the most corrupt individual to ever hold a government job run for president?
18 | Patricia Kay Meints | 10153996594075950_10153996632190950 | With all the behind the scenes cheating that has been caught anyone who is able to think on their own should question the results.
19 | Linda Newcomb | 10153996594075950_10153996728055950 | Suspense...moron. as if we are all on the edge of our chairs waiting..his followers though..?they will be doing just that holding their little guns waiting for their marching orders. Of course Trump won't accept defeat. He is already saying it's all rigged against him. So yeah I expect him to create as much chaos as possible as he leaves the spotlight. He won't concede he will encourage his followers to raise hell ..that will make him feel great but he will do it in a way as usual that won't lay blame on him. He always says well maybe or perhaps this or that should happen. His followers do it and he's squeeky clean..he will say I said perhaps I never told them to do that. The man is so predictable he is boring.
20 | Robert Stewart Asbury | 10153996594075950_10153996669495950 | Hillary is responsible for destroying Bernie's career and  disenfranchising his voters thru dirty, terrible, low down, extra-extra dirty politics. She runs an organization that has people stepping down or getting fired left and right over low down dirty politics. She runs an organization that thinks nothing of using the old nazis tactics of voter intimidation by sending mentally ill people to incite violence at her political opponent's rallies, where some of the people hurt were actual decent law abiding anti-Trump protestors. Wikileaks shows she's engaged in constant low down dirty politics, if not outright criminal activities. And you wonder why he may not blindly just accept the election results? Maybe it has nothing to do with him and everything to do with her way of doing politics.
21 | Todd Murphy | 10153996594075950_10153996735790950 | NATO has the backing of Soros, and of course the US in there push toward a destabilization of the Ukraine and bordering countries of Russia! Putin can't even understand why the Western population centers are not more concerned as Russia is pushed into a tighter and tighter corner in its own home land! The propaganda machine has never been more effective than it is today, such an ignorant public ripe for its instruction! A no fly zone in Syria means more than a escalation in hostilities between Russia and the West! It could mean the beginning of the unthinkable, if I were you America I would start paying the attention you should have had all along to the chicanery of a Globalist Elite of whom from behind the scenes may now be planning for their own survival in a world running out of options! Like Norm Chomsky said, "if you want to stop terrorism, then quit participating in it!" The world as we know it, can no longer exist if hostilities begin as a WWIII scenario. The US has allowed and embellished its own history and glorified war through propaganda brought to them via Hollywood and the Zionists who run their country! The realities of major conflict maybe burned back into every American soon if we don't look closely at ourselves in the mirror, but this time you may be starting down, "the river of no return"!
22 | Mary Purdie-Cravens | 10153996594075950_10153996736830950 | If she gets elected we may as well jus tear up our Constitution cuz it won't mean squat. The 240 yrs that we have followed the most honestly written paper in nations history will be destroyed. Where's the dems defending that? But let's support corruption deceit political correctness being religious is a bad thing but yet conservatives are thee assholes. Think they need to take a good long hard look in the mirrors before they sling anything.
23 | Todd Murphy | 10153996594075950_10153996623600950 | Greetings, I'm Hilary Clinton. To all of you who don't agree with me rigging the California voting process, with what happened in Benghazi, with the DNC stone walling Burnie, ha ha and Vince Foster well we all know what happened to him, I am only going to tell you this once don't get in my effing way!! Look at what I did to Gaddafi in Libya, hell for that matter look what it did to Libya! I helped NATO saluter 400,000 black Libyans, I took Libya from a nation with one of the best infrastructures, the highest standard of living, an 80% literacy rate, one of the best water systems in the known world, "the man made River" and completely destroyed it, brought it to ruin. I freed the people of Libya from Gaddafi, he was a Tyrant, oh I know you are probably wondering why 2.5 million of them gathered in one place at Green Square in Tripoli, the largest gathering in human history in support of him, but never mind that!! He really needed to go because he organized the North African Summit, where they talked about what the Colonial powers have done over 50 years of rule in North Africa! Gaddafi started a 9 trillion Dollar lawsuit against the globalist Bankers because of their crimes in North Africa! He was trying to bring North Africa on the gold dinar and free them from the petro dollar! Oh my God did I say that, strike that from the record! What I meant to say was, or the lie to keep repeating, "he was a dictator, a tyrant he tortured his people they hated him", there sorry about the other part! My globalists handlers will like this now! Don't learn about my record, my brilliant foreign-policy in the Middle East, how I destroyed ISIS, how I am above the law! Why I am Hillary Clinton, I am above you, you are beneath me, after all I run with the globalists the most powerful people in the world, people like Rupert Murdock and with them on my side I will do what ever the hell I want or at least what they tell me to do!! Now on the other hand don't listen to that narcissistic Donald Trump he will be a disaster he is he is a nationalist he will rebuild the United States secure the borders negotiate great trade deals he will bring America back to prominence and power! Donald is not a politician he is not really a Republican he is not really a Democrat he's an outsider he is a maniac if you want things to continue as they are then vote for me and if you want change, well real change is just scary! Donald Trump is scary, he will upset the Chinese after all it was my Billyboy who negotiated China into the World Trade Organization, never mind that they have never abided by the rules and they keep the yuan artificially lower than the dollar! Just listen to me I will never lie to you I am an honest straightforward law-abiding politician for the Democrats!! Donald Trump wants to be friends with Vladimir Putin, those nasty Russians anyway they are always getting in the way of the one world order! Putin went to Syria and destroyed all those oil tankers that were bringing oil in to Turkey and are corrupt government that we put in power there that is how we were funding ISIS secretly!! This is not in the one world globalist plan how dare he! Putin, he hacked my personal server here again another evil dictator getting in the way of a Globalist agenda!! Never mind that Mr. Putin that has an 80% approval rating with the Russian people, just listen to me little Sheeple, he is an evil dictator and the Russian people hate him! Never mind, that I had this server in my basement illegally and that I either lost or erased 30,000 emails and if it was hacked it was my own fault, never mind all of that I am here for you! Oh I know, others like Jeffrey Sterling, whose life was ruined by doing far less with classified documents got really nailed, or that Mr, Nobody in the US Navy that guy on the Sub serving his country got in big trouble just keep in mind here that Jeffrey Sterling is not Hillary Clinton I am above the law! The FBI even says that I am above the law! And if you don't like it you're going to end up like a lot of other people don't forget Vince Foster! I am Madame president and if you think that I was above the law before just wait folks!
24 | Rick Scagnelli | 10153996594075950_10153996694910950 | It only makes sense if you believe an election is rigged; that you have to wait till the end to see the results and how they were obtained before you can actually say how you're going to react; so he actually gave a good answer; unlike the useless ass he is running against
25 | Pam Thorson | 10153996594075950_10153996704470950 | What?!? Given the lies, deceit and double standards the dems employ on a daily basis?? Good for him! I don't trust that the Dems won't try to "fix" the election!!

A man who killed two cops was executed. He didn‚Äôt make a final statement and refused an offer of a prayer. Then he lay on the gurney with his eyes closed as the lethal drug flowed.

‚ÄúNo puppet. No Puppet,‚Äù said Donald Trump in response to Clinton's remark.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mary Ragan | 10153996527725950_10153996537790950 | Actually the puppets are the media and anyone else who is too afraid to think for themselves so they follow the crowd as not to be the odd ball or to be socially excepted....If anyone really says they can not see how corrupt Hillary is are plumb dumb and should not vote.
2 | Tim Hardwick | 10153996527725950_10153996555575950 | That was funny coming from the biggest puppet and crook of all the politicians.She is the puppet of the elite bankers and Arab Muslims Trump is his own man not rehearsed no practiced lies like Hillary.
3 | Gary Doan | 10153996527725950_10153996528795950 | Trump mentioned a video. I watched it after the debate. The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. Hillary blamed Trump for the violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country. The video is higher quality, real people boasting about committing crimes and their criminal network, with names, titles and ties. Watch it if you doubt it, it has gone viral on youtube.
4 | Angie Stanley | 10153996527725950_10153996548440950 | I believe it! They are puppets! The Rothchilds and the Elite are the puppet masters. Research people....we have a shadow government, and NWO is on its way in..Hillary is gonna win, she was chosen years ago, cause ww3 must be started, to get the ball rolling....research it....Soros and Rothchilds, Rockefellars...its all at your fingertips....
5 | Bassam Zakhour | 10153996527725950_10153996614510950 | No puppet no puppet.. what you expect from a clown claiming that the political system is so corrupt and at the same time he is heavily involved in it, using the tax money he is not paying to donate into this political system... I am sorry, ppl can be dumb but not this much.
6 | Mike Oey | 10153996527725950_10153996540140950 | The debates never discussed policies in which Clinton cant win - so their strategy was to use soap opera issues thats are more entertaining in which Trump has no clue - Leftards Libtards Democrats live in alternative world when lying is the only way to sustain their power
7 | Thomas Franks | 10153996527725950_10153996553845950 | Hillary won again. Glad to know Hillary did so well. Now it is time to wrap up this election and put it to bed. I have been following Hillary since her primary race against Obama. If you recall, Clinton got more popular votes than Obama. She has always been a serious contender and fighter. This gave her more experience. The election of President Obama was a good thing. Now it is time for the baton to be handed over to Hillary Clinton. It is time for all to come together and give Hillary the respect and the Presidency she deserves. I ask that we give her a resounding victory by giving her the house and the senate. So many people in our country and in our world have so much to gain in her Presidency. She is the symbol of compassion, love and hope. Let us all join her.
8 | Johnny Guin | 10153996527725950_10153996708415950 | Trump equals change. Take a look around. This country needs someone to get rid of these corrupt politicians and most of the media outlets as well. Get out and vote people!
9 | Bryan Bissell | 10153996527725950_10153996573340950 | The real puppets are the ones watching these mainstream media outlets on a daily basis and having their minds twisted on a daily basis. The media has their hands so far up your ass it isn't even funny. It's sad, really.
10 | Jorge W DeQueiroz | 10153996527725950_10153996545870950 | yeah blame russia ... Everything that comes out of hrc's mouth is a lie (emails, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Haiti, clinton foundation, you name it). No trust in hrc, msm and cronies. Have to closely follow the voting mainly when hrc is running for president together with her record of evil doings. What BO/HRC have done to Chelsea Manning, Snowden and Assange show we have no rights and freedom of the press and speech. We live in a totalitarian State of a kleptocracy that blames all our problems on Russia in public and in private settles uranium deals with them.I'm no great DT fan but the allegations of outright msm pro-hrc PR campaign and avoidance of hrc's destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice, lies and scandals published by Wikileaks which are far more grave make me certain that the only way to see the truth is to alternate power.
11 | Carol McAleavey Moore | 10153996527725950_10153996565290950 | Typically liberal projecting who they are and there actions on someone else. Who is being funded by Qatar and Saudi Arabia?Hillary Clinton's puppets: -President -DOJ-FBI-Media-Hart research associates polling results. -paid agitators-Democrats using dead people's name to vote.- Democrats registering illegals to vote.This is the Hillary's  Clinton machine at her best doing  what she knows spreading her poison,  corruption and fraud in this wonderful country. Paying people to undermine our democracy.
12 | Sheila Lee | 10153996527725950_10153996682360950 | Democrats should be ashamed to say that Russians hacked into their business and outsmarted them.  Do we want to continue electing people that Putin outsmarts at every turn?
13 | Steven Allen Ritnour | 10153996527725950_10153996663725950 | One set for the rich and powerful political class.One set for the unconnected powerless people.Laws that would lock me up for 20 years are just an insignificant annoyance to government operatives.This is my #1 issue when I enter the voting booth.Who is more likely to clean up the corruption?
14 | Steve Lancaster | 10153996527725950_10153996576165950 | This Morning CBS News spent 15 minutes bashing Donald J. Trump and interviewing themselves then Kaine saying Hillary won....What do you think, of course Donald J. Trump Won this debate.
15 | Dean Haas Jr | 10153996527725950_10153996553910950 | Hillary is the puppet - and Soros is pulling her strings. Trump had her dead to rights last night. She is the only one of the two that has ever met Putin, or did a multi-million dollar uranium deal with them, yet she accused Trump of colluding with them on the Wikileaks info? Talk about deflecting from the truth! And yes, Hillary, your State Dept lost $6 BILLION  - where is it?
16 | David Hughes | 10153996527725950_10153996723350950 | everyone remember this...bill Clinton and trump agree we need to reduce corporate tax to 20% to get more industry going.   they both agree illegal immigration hurts American.....they both agree Obama care is crazy......Hillary disagrees on all three...we already have highest corporate tax in the world. increase it and watch what left leave.
17 | Robin Barron | 10153996527725950_10153996576580950 | Hillary NO need for late term abortion! If you are sick the best treatment is induction or C section! Donald J. Trump a Champion for life! I had severe preclampsia I had my son early induced for life of mother, me! With preclampsia you have to deliver the baby. I was and am so blessed to Have my son. Vote #TrumpPence

19 | Norman G. Palmer II | 10153996527725950_10153996536700950 | DJT won this debate hands down, he didn't try to deflect any questions as did clinton.
20 | Wanda Upton Watkins | 10153996527725950_10153996630330950 | Demand NBC, ABC AND CBS Address and report on this. The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country.
21 | Mike Randall | 10153996527725950_10153996712095950 | I can't get over how Hillary wants more gun control to save children then wants taxpayers to fund abortion to murder children!!
22 | Mike Fondots | 10153996527725950_10153996589975950 | Being that Clinton is the biggest puppet ever to run for presidency, .... pot meet kettle
23 | Ed Cowdrey | 10153996527725950_10153996541905950 | And I can't get over CBS's obvious bias and poor journalism
24 | Patricia Kay Meints | 10153996527725950_10153996628585950 | Does this channel get paid by the Clinton machine or do they do this for free????
25 | Robert Smith | 10153996527725950_10153996536060950 | She called him a puppet then he called her a nasty biotch. PC version. üòÇ

Commentary: "Trump will almost assuredly lose. The question now is what he‚Äôs willing to do to the country once he does."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dawn Larson | 10153996499700950_10153996504355950 | There will be no 110% of the registered voters casting votes that will be "accepted" without challenge. Unlike Romney who conceded far too early, Trump just threw down the gauntlet and made it very clear, that if any shenanigans or there are election results that are in question, he intends to challenge those results and will not just roll over, as Romney did. I absolutely agree with that. So do millions of voters. Good for him!
2 | Mary Flannery | 10153996499700950_10153996524830950 | Its funny how CBS is the only one saying Hillary won the debate. All others are saying Trump won. Shows who she's really paying off.
3 | Sean Grealey | 10153996499700950_10153996507010950 | I just want to address something that Hillary just spoke (or lied) about during the debate...LATE TERM ABORTION or PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION.  Hilary got all serious saying that she has  spoken with mothers who have had to make the worst decision of their life when they had to choose to abort their full term baby due to their own health problems.  Well, HILARY, what you failed to tell people is that a baby at that point in the pregnancy has a VERY GOOD chance of surviving if delivered (alive)!  The argument that late term abortion should be legalized if the mother's life is in danger is a false argument!  If the mother's life is in danger, all they have to do is deliver the baby and give it a chance to survive on it's own!  Why on earth would we kill it?  If you don't know what PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION consists of, take a look at this visual.  They deliver the baby (legs first) but pay close attention to make sure the head isn't delivered.  Then they take a pair of scissors and stab the baby in the back of the neck/head.  They, then, suction out the baby's brains and then remove the rest of the baby from the birth canal.  Why do they pay close attention to leave the head in the birth canal?  Because if they deliver the head and THEN stab it in the back of the neck, they will be charged with MURDER!!  How is that for double standards???  Seriously, this is the worst kind of abortion that there is and Hillary wants it to be legalized!!!  She kills me, how she gets on tv and talks about being an advocate for the "children" and how she always has been.  She's a fraud, people, and I don't understand how anyone can believe her lies!  (Below is an excerpt from Florida RIght to Life website concerning Partial Birth Abortion in the second / third trimester)Surgical, Second and Third Trimester: Partial-Birth Abortion Abortionists sometimes refer to these or similar types of abortions using obscure, clinical-sounding euphemisms such as ‚ÄúDilation and Extraction‚Äù (D&X), or ‚Äúintact D&E‚Äù (IDE) which mask the realities of how the abortions are actually performed.24 This procedure is used to abort women who are 20 to 32 weeks pregnant‚Äîor even later into pregnancy. (Many babies born at 23 weeks (gestational age) or more survive.25 Partial-birth abortion eliminates that possibility. Guided by ultrasound, the abortionist reaches into the uterus, grabs the unborn baby‚Äôs leg with forceps, and pulls the baby into the birth canal, except for the head, which is deliberately kept just inside the womb. (At this point in a partial-birth abortion, the baby is alive.) Then the abortionist jams scissors into the back of the baby‚Äôs skull and spreads the tips of the scissors apart to enlarge the wound. After removing the scissors, a suction catheter is inserted into the skull and the baby‚Äôs brains are sucked out. The collapsed head is then removed from the uterus. 26 Partial-birth abortion is a particularly gruesome procedure. Partial-birth abortion is now prohibited in the United States under federal law.
4 | Karen Elizabeth Hunt-Maddry | 10153996499700950_10153996551100950 | He did not say he would refuse to accept election results. He said we will wait and see. Who can blame him. We have dead people and illegals voting, voter fraud, ballots being destroyed by postal workers, Trump headquarters being firebombed. He's entitled to say, we will wait and see.
5 | Janis Roney Mires Walrond | 10153996499700950_10153996546900950 | Clinton lied,lied and lied last night. Twice she even said oh yes I voted for that BUT I now go the other way. She is only saying what she thinks will get her elected. Evil bitch.
6 | Gary Doan | 10153996499700950_10153996504490950 | Trump mentioned a video. I watched it after the debate. The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. Hillary blamed Trump for the violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country. The video is higher quality, real people boasting about committing crimes and their criminal network, with names, titles and ties. Watch it if you doubt it, it has gone viral on youtube.
7 | Pennie Johnson | 10153996499700950_10153996545820950 | Wow CBS, biased much? Isn't journalism supposed to be all about integrity, telling the truth and fact finding? As journalists you should be ashamed of yourselves. Having personal political views of your own is all fine and dandy but when your on the job, leave your personal political beliefs at the door.
8 | Teresa Muschott | 10153996499700950_10153996509455950 | people are taking his final response about accepting the results too severly yet they can accept aborting babies at 9 months, lying and being caught in the lies thru wiki leaks and so much more by a woman who will lead us to hell
9 | Susan McDonald | 10153996499700950_10153996552565950 | When did CBS become one that knows the results of an election, that hasn't taken place??? CBS must be brown nose for the "Clinton foundation"! So what is she giving you in return? Your life? No one with CBS strangely comes up dead??? Just curious? He is not coward and won't back down because someone doesn't agree with him. Like CBS. Voter fraud is real, or there wouldn't be over 20 dead people registered to vote in Virginia alone. #theend
10 | Lily Pass | 10153996499700950_10153996559070950 | Clearly Hillary DID NOT win the debate ....however, Nora and Gail...as journalists we are left knowing your  opinion instead of offering us the facts and news!  America watches not because we want to know your thoughts and opinions but to actually to hear strong and low issues BOTH candidates had.
11 | Matt Yarbrough | 10153996499700950_10153996503230950 | Hilary is not getting off the hook for pushing for "BABIES" to be slayed!! And torn out their mothers even if she is almost due. She need investigation!
12 | Mario Arana | 10153996499700950_10153996512695950 | The liberal corruption and hypocrisy is being exposed every day. Hillary Clinton only cares about power, she does not care about the American people. #DrainTheSwamp2016
13 | Stephie Belle | 10153996499700950_10153996551525950 | Even if she'd killed someone in her campaign, you'd declare she's won. She crows about her experience but she certainly hasn't made significant difference as secretary of state. She's just a polish, scripted politician
14 | BobandWanda Hurley | 10153996499700950_10153996558265950 | Please tell me CBS which Clinton are we suppose to believe, the Clinton behind the podium or the Clinton behind the emails. Soccer Moms best wake up because these borders will be flooded with refugees based on her emails which puts you children in harms way! Do you want to shoulder that responsibility?  Do you want blood on your hands? Based on the polls these so call CBS experts have determined you are the difference in this election!  I hope you can live with yourself!
15 | Jorge W DeQueiroz | 10153996499700950_10153996538910950 | Everything that comes out of hrc's mouth is a lie (emails, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Haiti, clinton foundation, you name it).

16 | Glenn Hoffert | 10153996499700950_10153996619580950 | Hahahaha, what were you watching? When pressed about the content of her emails, and her foundation, she had no rebuttal. No defense. She's a criminal and you all know it, and the sad part for this country.... you don't care. SHEEP
17 | Annette Pellinen | 10153996499700950_10153996579255950 | Your pathetic! Why don't you report about the wiki leaks where crooked Hillarys campaign insults Catholics and Hispanics and Christians and says Bernie sanders supporters are basement dwellers living with their parents. The emails show all the scandal and corruption in Hillarys campaign and the Democratic Party. Why don't you you report on all that? I'll tell you why bcuz your nose is so far up Hillarys ass you have shit all over your faces! Do some fair honest reporting bcuz after this election your going off the air your network sucks!
18 | Jessica Davis | 10153996499700950_10153996608365950 | For all this 'Hilary is going win', I haven't seen but ONE 'Hilary for President' sign since this thing started. Trump signs are EVERYWHERE I look. Not to say it's definitive but definitely odd.
19 | Melody Johnson | 10153996499700950_10153996648080950 | I pray not and if YOU "the news media" would tell all the illegal things she has done and is doing and put as much time on her faults as you do on his then this would be a fair. You are trying so hard to win this for her but most of us see though your plan. I wish you would just be FAIR!!!!!
20 | Kenneth Coburn | 10153996499700950_10153996575340950 | CBS News your all retarded what debate did u watch? Trump nailed it and put her ass out to dry, or rot on jail where she needs to be. I hope Trump gets in and keeps his word on putting her ass in jail!
21 | James Weck | 10153996499700950_10153996613670950 | CBS, you misleading lying fucks, Al Gore took the 2000 election to the United States Supreme Court & lost his case. Trump answered the question honestly, he doesn't know what he'll do if he believes there has been massive voter fraud, to which there has been evidence of already. He has the option & every right to challenge the election if there's evidence of fraud. He answered the question truthfully in saying, "we'll have to see." That's Trumps best attribute, he tells it like it is, and doesn't lie or blow smoke up people's ass like Hillary. It's easy to see why the mainstream media hates him so much, truthfulness, honesty, and integrity are attributes your scared shitless of.
22 | Sonya Long-Russell | 10153996499700950_10153996579550950 | I'm trying to figure out why this article ends with this short paragraph, and why it was the one sentence used as the headline?  It makes no sense and comes off as very paranoid. "Trump will almost assuredly lose. The question now is what he‚Äôs willing to do to the country once he does."
23 | Dee Ames | 10153996499700950_10153996586125950 | The most important takeaway from the debate, Trump refusing to say he will accept the outcome of the election. I hope all of you are smart enough to be enraged by Trump the Coward, a Man who has not one reservation about undermining the bedrock of our Democracy and that is Free and Fair Elections. This is an insult to our 240 year old Country and to all of the Administrations & Candidates who have lost elections with dignity and transferred powerful in a Diplomatic manner for the good of the people and this Country. The majority of Americans have and will on November 8th resoundingly reject Donald Trump and his ideas. When the numbers come in, pay close attention, they will speak volumes. Why is the #GOP dead? Because feckless Leaders like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are still endorsing Trump and they will refuse to stand up to his behavior, which is just plain "Bigly" Bad for America. #VoteBlue America, the Democratic Party is the ONLY party working for YOU. Madam President, get used to it. #HRC2016
24 | Shanti Keyz | 10153996499700950_10153996512625950 | What's stupid is the people's vote doesn't even matter. It's the electorial that actually picks the winner. That's how bush jr got on the first time, with the electorial vote and not the popular vote. So it doesn't matter who the people vote for.
25 | Lynda Haskins | 10153996499700950_10153996634205950 | Only people without souls support partial birth abortion. This should tell any decent human being all they need to know about Hillary Clinton. Most of these procedures are not necessary to save the life of the mothers as Hillary is well aware.

1 | Pauline Giorgi | 10153996465960950_10153996506645950 | What!!! She looked like she had a straight jacket on. Lol.. she lied her whole way thru. Please, the Clinton's are as corrupt as the news.
2 | Omar Orfali | 10153996465960950_10153996478280950 | Trump lost badly, same old boring lines, rambling on points that make no sense. But I gotta give him credit for being entertaining, he was the butt of some very funny remarks. So long Putins Pumpkin Spice Puppet, back in your holes deplorables. Its over.
3 | Ay≈üin Turan | 10153996465960950_10153996501375950 | You guys are idiots...so the most important thing about a presidential debate was what Hillary was wearing???
4 | Michael Friday | 10153996465960950_10153996470070950 | She really is trying to look like a certain leader from North Korea...I guess if she's going to be an oppressive authoritarian, she might as well dress the part.....
5 | Dee Bee | 10153996465960950_10153996491270950 | You news outlets are a joke, why don't you talk about Clinton's KKK support, all the wikileaks, the Benghazi fuckery. Yall are a complete joke an why this country is where its at
6 | Thomas Franks | 10153996465960950_10153996472260950 | Glad to know Hillary did so well. Now it is time to wrap up this election and put it to bed. I have been following Hillary since her primary race against Obama. If you recall, Clinton got more popular votes than Obama. She has always been a serious contender and fighter. This gave her more experience. The election of President Obama was a good thing. Now it is time for the baton to be handed over to Hillary Clinton.

7 | Velma Martin | 10153996465960950_10153996477970950 | She looked sooooo Presidential....let's just get this election over with and let that jackass Trump go down in history as one big freaking con artist.
8 | Andrea Klein | 10153996465960950_10153996491845950 | Hillary Clinton has played the ‚ÄúRussia card to not answer any questions but no one in the media,no one in the Democratic party, not Hillary not anyone has denied that the Wikileaks were indeed accurate.All they say is that Russia is responsible for the hacks.No one is denying that the information in these hacks is true and factual.This bait and switch by Hilary Clinton is soobvious and so lowbrow she must believe voters are all true idiots who would buy her nonsense.I would like someone to ask her if she can answer a question about the email leaks without mentioning Russia and she should show proof of why Russia is behind this ...WikiLeaks, had nothing to do with the conspiracies promoted by the Clinton camp. WikiLeaks reputation is cristal clear never ever told something wrong!
9 | John Preiss | 10153996465960950_10153996480645950 | She looked like a female Boss Hog from the Dukes of Hazzard...
10 | Tina Tsoukas | 10153996465960950_10153996498745950 | Trump Lost badly he has no idea on any politics he can't structure America and the people like his Buildings impossible he's Fake and this political circus is all about himself and his Billions no one else we would be doomed Hillary will win the Democratic Ticket shes not perfect not who is in this world but she's served this country 30 years
11 | Dawn Cisek | 10153996465960950_10153996549460950 | I think her outfit was very appropriate. She looked like a butcher. Now all she needs is the blood of the American people and her costume is complete.
12 | Jerry Brown | 10153996465960950_10153996571170950 | Some people are good speakers especially when they rehearsed their lies over and over again if you like the way things are Hillary will fit you but for me Trump is are only chance for a better country Trump is the one
13 | Bobette Bryan | 10153996465960950_10153996607425950 | It was a great choice! I intend to wear white when I vote for her in honor of our first woman president and women's suffrage rights.
14 | Fern Ladouceur | 10153996465960950_10153996591300950 | Hillary didn't WIn The debate, I watched the whole damn thing , and all she is good for is reading off notes , Heck she couldn't even give her last surprise question answer without looking at her notes . Its supposed to come from her , That's what made me notice that it wasn't a surprise questions , Its was ALL a set up . Who's the Puppet . HILLARY Clinton . Who will rebuild The USA Donald Trump ........ Why hillary is a Good talker , It's because she studied to be a Good liar, And good liars become Good Speakers. Seriously She is a Politician . My God I never would have taught in a million years the The USA Would be so Fckn Blind to what really Matters . Whatever its Your own Funeral . I'm not Giving up On Donald J. Trump . And you shouldn't either . The guy is a Businessman , Not an Executioner .
15 | Patty Marsibilio | 10153996465960950_10153996469950950 | the WHITE SUIT ensemble worn by Hillary is a lovely shade of WHITEWATER.
16 | Wanda Upton Watkins | 10153996465960950_10153996632485950 | You have the right to know the truth. Demand NBC, ABC AND CBS Address and report on this. The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country.
17 | Shawna Bailes | 10153996465960950_10153996670430950 | Dear media: the only article a presidential nominee wears or doesn't wear that I'm concerned about would be a flag pin on her lapel. Which is missing on her, but that still is the least of my concerns when the future of our country is turned into a joke of a reality show. Content of character and the intentions of nominees is what I'm concerned about. And between you and me, with these two for our choices, I'm seriously concerned for our country.
18 | Ron Evans | 10153996465960950_10153996719815950 | So here's the REAL story. Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers.Copied and pasted...and pasted again and again and again until everyone reads this truth.... share
19 | Sherry Buschhorn | 10153996465960950_10153996532965950 | Yes really something that he doesn't want to see a child ripped from a mother's womb and killed by twisting IT'S head off like Hillary is all for on late term abortions when the baby is ready to be born and fully developed!
20 | Evelyn Gwynn | 10153996465960950_10153996517755950 | For Trump to say he didn't know Putin was a lie!! He has met the man several times; he stated that himself. He even said he loved him. So what are the American people to believe. Now he will use his flunkies to get him out of his own messages! He is just not fit to be President.
21 | Lori Nixon Muscato | 10153996465960950_10153996513435950 | I assumed it was winter white, but still an ugly pantsuit. Can't believe Ralph Lauren makes pants suits. Or that anyone wears them.
22 | Laura Reynolds | 10153996465960950_10153996731200950 | LOL since this is the most important thing on women's mind is Hillary's pantsuit. FYI, white is the color for surrendering. So who did Hillary surrender to last night?
23 | Matt Yarbrough | 10153996465960950_10153996468005950 | Anybody notice how sick it was for Hilary to promote murdering babies???
24 | Sharee Zimmerle-Garrison | 10153996465960950_10153996678870950 | It's Hillary's people that made what she was wearing important insinuating that it was some sort of suffragette thing whenever you know that if you dig too far in the past you don't get what you want as far as an emotional response the emotional response that everyone gave for this white pant suit is "oh wow Dr. evil is back"!
25 | Staci Linley Stender | 10153996465960950_10153996634140950 | Ah yes. Society. Running to lead the free world and the headlines are about what she is wearing like she's in the red carpet. Because she is a she. Ugh

As was the case in the last two debates, this candidate received the most activity on social media.

1 | Patrick Thibodeaux | 10153996424585950_10153996432360950 | Trump won s blind man could see that. However the news will continue to try and twist it around, because he hurt their feelings speaking the truth and calling them out. Sorry CBS he's not s puppet you can't make him say what you want him to.
2 | Dave Kovacs | 10153996424585950_10153996458865950 | How much money are you idiots being paid to praise Trump?  Once again, he sounded like a little whiny bitch last night. He's a joke and a rapist. Anyone who votes for him is a moron.
3 | Thomas Franks | 10153996424585950_10153996476770950 | Good report by Washington Post. Hillary won again. Glad to know Hillary did so well. Now it is time to wrap up this election and put it to bed. I have been following Hillary since her primary race against Obama. If you recall, Clinton got more popular votes than Obama. She has always been a serious contender and fighter. This gave her more experience. The election of President Obama was a good thing. Now it is time for the baton to be handed over to Hillary Clinton. It is time for all to come together and give Hillary trhe respect and the Presidency she deserves. I ask that we give her a resounding victory by giving her the house and the senate. So many people in our country and in our world have so much to gain in her Presidency. She is the symbol of compassion, love and hope. Let us all join her.
4 | Judith Redman Kirk | 10153996424585950_10153996441765950 | Donald Trump did a magnificent job..Without a doubt he won fair and square....Hillary was more  worried and concerned with sticking to the script on her podium than saying how she felt about any topic..
5 | Bonnie Berger | 10153996424585950_10153996720925950 | She is guilty anyone who says she isn't needs to get a clue. FBI says she did it, slick willy meets with the attorney general. Basically called her stupid. I guess they didn't want to commit suicide.
6 | Tim Hardwick | 10153996424585950_10153996458080950 | he is up against crooks and he has to wait to see if he needs to protest the election or not it shows honesty that he did not say he will except the outcome.If they still it and it's easy to see then of course he should fight it as long as he can for all of us.
7 | David Cornelison | 10153996424585950_10153996467235950 | Given how much most Americans despise both candidates. that passion from the idiot's supporters may make the difference in the election.  I think we are going to have record low turnouts.
8 | Alejandra L Mallari | 10153996424585950_10153996482570950 | Trump said that he will build wall and make Mexico pay for it but when he met their president, he choked, hahaha, makes him wom the debate?
9 | Jon R Welch | 10153996424585950_10153996447820950 | I haven't heard a chance to watch the debate as of yet I work nights. With that being said I going to pet the major news networks singing in ABC NBC CBS will say Hillary one because they are so by is it is absolutely pathetic the last two the base the mediators gained up on Trump constantly.
10 | Gary Eckman | 10153996424585950_10153996759955950 | Trump is a Racist FOOL. But at least he is a rapist(molester) too. So hes more than just a bigot, hes a Russian loving fat pig also. Many people are telling me he is going to lose, because they hate rapists. I think he will lose because people tell me he is a Failure. SAD. Everyone feels Trump is a Loser. He hates Fat women. He only molests(rape) the thinner ones. He is a PIG! He LOST. But he may still have his coke, Thank God. Jesus would never vote for Trump. Ever. People that are Christian Know this. They have been saying Trump is a disgrace. Many agree.
11 | Gary Doan | 10153996424585950_10153996430280950 | Trump mentioned a video. I watched it after. The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. Hillary blamed Trump for the violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country.
12 | Keishelle Achong | 10153996424585950_10153996442335950 | The rest of the world don't have to worry. Trump hasn't contributed any taxes for border security, for our US Military to fight and protect our country and embassies and etc. But, I bet you did! Trump and his followers, "Let's make [Russia] great again!" How American? Lol hypocrites
13 | Sue Anne Morgan | 10153996424585950_10153996510805950 | Anyone who thinks Trump is qualified to be President is simply delusional.

15 | Ricky Taylor | 10153996424585950_10153996440840950 | The cowardly lying Hillary was stomped and put in her place for sending people to trumps rallies and creating problems.
16 | Scott Emge | 10153996424585950_10153996465775950 | Hillary grins like a cheshire cat while Trump asks her to return money donated to her from islamic countries that murder gays and oppress andmutiilate women. Apparently Hillary thinks these crimes against hays and women are funny.
17 | J.r. Rich-Bellerose | 10153996424585950_10153996510185950 | Getting the most Twitter activity doesn't mean he won if all the tweets were negative again him.

While people still legally have one. Freedom of speech will soon be gone and the truth will go right with it. You think I'm wrong? Just look at all the criminal stuff they've done and no one will chare them, they are the biggest bullies the world has ever seen and that's no lie, it's a fact.

3 | Precious Mixon | 10153996395870950_10153996445850950 | We have all these thousands of Veterans in this country that are homeless, no health care, etc. Treated as if they are from a 3rd world country . When they are the ones that shouldn't have to worry about healthcare, and where they will lay their head to sleep tonight, if their family will have food and warm clothes. But Nooooo!!! Give it to all these illegal aliens and  immigrants that have done nothing for this country but help bring it down. Look out for those destroying our country before you do those that fought, and sacrificed everything they had for this country. So you can live free. Way to go Hillary !!! You sure aren't the brightest crayon in the box at the crazy house are you !?
4 | Greg Mundy | 10153996395870950_10153996748370950 | Hillary Clinton said America Is Great.If you are a Millionaire or Billionaire, America is GreatIf you have Wall Street paying you millions of dollars for speeches,America is Great.If you are rich and pay less taxes than your secretary, Americais Great.If you are the top 1% in this country, America is Great.However,If you are one of the millions who live in poverty in this country, it is not so great.If you are a disabled veteran who is living homeless in the streets,it is not so great.If you have gotten yourself into thousands of dollars in college debt,just to find out that there are no jobs for you. it is not so great.If you are one who grieves over a love who has died in this continuingwar of lies of WMDs. it is not so great.When women who do the same work as men are paid only 70%, it is notso great.When you are an unarmed black man and have to fear the police, or afraidto walk outside your door due to gang banging and violence it is not so great. When you live in a country that has over 400 Billionaires, but still havehomeless people, even children, in the streets living in tents and cardboard boxes, it is not so great.Why does the top 1% of the people in the country have more wealththan the bottom 70%?Why is it, the owner of Wal-Mart has made Billions of dollars, butthe workers who does the work, have wages so low that they needto be on food stamps?Why do we have a government that caters to and is bought and ownedby the rich and big corporation, instead of a government of thepeople, for the people, and by the people?Change, when you feel America is great, you do not believe in change.As they say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.I don't know about you and Hillary, but I think it's broke and itis time for someone to fix it.America, I have only one question, come November, are you ready to fix it.

6 | Stan Stewart | 10153996395870950_10153996482315950 | Trump seems unable or unwilling to understand that America is operated through a democratic form of government, not an autocracy. He repeatedly presents himself as a person who isn't open to advice and mistakenly or arrogantly believes a President is a Dictator. His predictions of his post-election actions, should he win or lose, are areas of concern because a President Trump would abuse the powers of the Presidency to:enact revenge upon Clinton and others who speak against him, to attempt to scale back freedom of the press, eliminate a woman's right to choose regarding birth control and abortion, and,he seems unconcerned regarding the importance of alliances with foreign powers who (like America) seek democratic government. Trump's attitudes towards minorities, women, Muslims, disabled people, and veterans demonstrates a bias and indifference towards these and other groups, which make up a significant portion of the American population. A President with glaring biases such as these, who has also now threatened to stack the Supreme Court with Justices who would likely repeal Civil Rights laws and ban abortions, is not one who allows equality. Such a person would be a dictator, a despot, in addition to what Trump already has proven himself to be: a sociopathic bigoted sexist demagogue.
7 | Cheryl Sheppard | 10153996395870950_10153996679640950 | I'm not surprised Trump didn't give a direct answer about his tax proposal.   Unless you are part of the 10% you are going to have less money in your pockets.

They've been quoted statingtheir ultimate plan is to destroy America from within. Nothing like handing them a key to the WH. #HumaAbedin has successfully infiltrated our government. God help us all if she gets into the WH.#kilary is surrounded by unscrupulous people just as corrupt as Huma. Yet you believe she is fit to be President! How about you do a small bit of research yourself & stop listening to what the corrupt media decides to put on blast. It's the lazy American whom neglects to do their due diligence. As a result placing our country at even greater risk. This information is easily found via Google. I also recommend the 13 minute video of #kilary  lying.

A school contract worker allegedly threw the 13-year-old boy to the ground multiple times and didn't give medical aid before placing him on a school bus.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Crystal Lee | 10153996330175950_10153996356630950 | So what you're sayin is because this kid seemed "unruly" or just got in the workers nerves. Or maybe even a bad day for the worker, the kid now doesnt have a leg?!? Seriously, how is a child supposed to live out his life minus a leg over an a**hole workers force of "restraint".
2 | Sherry Amature | 10153996330175950_10153996373220950 | I have worked in public and alternative schools. Improper restraining, and you never put a child on a bus hurt. Someone needs to be held accountable.
3 | Roxanne Rudeck | 10153996330175950_10153996503055950 | People seem to be arguing whether the child being "slammed to the ground" was appropriate. We should be focusing on the fact that an injured student was carried onto a bus and sent home when medical care should have been provided. It really doesn't matter what the child did. It doesn't matter if he was restrained or slammed to the ground. The issue that needs explanation is why this injured child was carried onto a bus and sent home.
4 | Debra Rishel | 10153996330175950_10153996630015950 | Did I miss something? What was the injury to the leg that was so severe as to require amputation? I have a feeling there were several things, maybe broken bone required surgery to repair then became infected and infection didn't resond to treatment resulting in amputation?
5 | Sandra Austin | 10153996330175950_10153996708155950 | If the child was supposedly that unruly the worker should have called police and for assistance right away. To injure him so seriously that his leg had to be amputated is unjust brutality. Worse the school knowing he was injured and not calling an ambulance but carrying him to a school bus is disgracefully unbelievable!! I hope the boy and his family win their lawsuit with all that they are entitled to!
6 | Randy Riddle | 10153996330175950_10153996371680950 | Little bastard can hop around like a little bitty bird now. You people are too stuffy about trivial concerns. How do "slam"somebody to the point of a dead leg? Brock Leaner would be impressed. Say you had no feeling in your leg and Mr School Man just wanted you on the bus and gone, was it a trip to the Grand Canyon. He'll no. Dead leg asshole would be to his destination and phone whatever medical gripe he may or may not have to anybody in the world.. Not buying it. Bullshit story.
7 | Michelle Yanacheak | 10153996330175950_10153996524545950 | Regardless of whether he was restrained or slammed on the ground, he should have gotten medical attention when he asked for it.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Gary Doan | 10153996256385950_10153996258585950 | Trump mentioned a video. I watched it after. The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country.
2 | Darlene Raunio | 10153996256385950_10153996361875950 | The more I think and review what I've heard/read so far on these "email" scandals it makes me wonder ... why exactly are they so "important?" All I see, if truth be told, is communications between diffeent people, under different circumstances when talking on a phone or talking in person is not an option. If EVERYONE in this country were ever double-checked on their texts/emails then we'd be in a lot of hurt. What it boils down to - aren't officials allowed to converse with one another, brainstorm if you will?  Get over it, suck it up and quit stagnating over these emails.
3 | Mark Scanlan | 10153996256385950_10153996331805950 | All those leaked documents and you focus on failed campaign slogans. Take a long, hard look at yourself, "journalists." You have a much greater responsibility to fulfill.

Today, the FBI admitted that Hillary Clinton endangered the American people‚Äîand confirmed that the worst things any of us imagined about Hillary‚Äôs email server were true.FBI Director James Comey concluded that Clinton was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù in handling our nation‚Äôs secrets.He admitted that no reasonable person could have believed putting these emails on a private server was at all appropriate or acceptable.He admitted that 110 emails on the server were classified at the time they were sent‚Äîshowing that Hillary not only lied, but knowingly endangered national security as Secretary of State.He admitted that Hillary deleted work-related emails before turning them over to the State Department, despite her claims otherwise.And most shocking, Mr. Comey even admitted that it‚Äôs likely foreign governments hacked her emails--and that our adversaries could know critical secrets about the U.S. government because of Hillary‚Äôs actions.But when you‚Äôre a Clinton, none of this matters. Not when you have the ear of the President, or you can call a secret airport meeting with the Attorney General. Not when you behave as if you‚Äôre above the law, and will never be held responsible for your actions.Mr. Comey admitted that someone caught in a similar situation would ‚Äúoften‚Äù be punished. And yet, he announced the FBI would not recommend criminal charges for Hillary Clinton.It‚Äôs not just a miscarriage of justice, but a blow to the very heart of our democracy. This is a shameful day for the rule of law and the security of our nation, no matter what your political beliefs may be.The Obama Administration might be circling the wagons, and doing all they can to prop up their corrupt, incompetent, untrustworthy Democratic nominee‚Äîbut the American people know better.

1 | Charles R Jones Jr | 10153996208340950_10153996340225950 | Based on this headline, you see the biased reporting structure is very subtle. If the Supreme Court rules on the side of the Constitution, everyone is protected. Her push for "A Woman's Right To Choose" is a dangerous slope from her and the way far left. Late term and partial birth abortion is horrible. Don't believe me!? Look it up! The Supreme Court is the real issue of this election. If the wrong people are confirmed to the office and rights begin to disappear they will ALL disappear.To be on the side of the Constitution is to be on the side of the people as free Americans. Donald J. Trump is the only choice that can win the election. These other 3rd, 4th, 5th party candidates are wasted votes. I hope one day to see an honorable, qualified woman as president, but Hillary Clinton is not the one. 25 years I watched her in politics and she has no accomplishments to stand behind that have been good for America or Americans! Period!

12 | Jorge W DeQueiroz | 10153996208340950_10153996552795950 | Everything that comes out of hrc's mouth is a lie (emails, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Haiti, clinton foundation, you name it). No trust in hrc, msm and cronies. Have to closely follow the voting mainly when hrc is running for president together with her record of evil doings. What BO/HRC have done to Chelsea Manning, Snowden and Assange show we have no rights and freedom of the press and speech. We live in a totalitarian State of a kleptocracy that blames all our problems on Russia in public and in private settles uranium deals with them.I'm no great DT fan but the allegations of outright msm pro-hrc PR campaign and avoidance of hrc's destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice, lies and scandals published by Wikileaks which are far more grave make me certain that the only way to see the truth is to alternate power.
13 | Brad Smith | 10153996208340950_10153996225685950 | Gays should have never been allowed to get married....since they can now...the judges in this country can marry them. They don't have the right to sue a preacher for not marrying them
14 | Alan Finch | 10153996208340950_10153996396030950 | Yeh, she will turn the USA into some kind of crazy basket case..Vote for Clinton is a vote to sellout the USA.
15 | Michael Friday | 10153996208340950_10153996498575950 | She's interested in lining her pockets with donations from special interest groups and he's concerned about our Rights and the Constitution....not a difficult choice.
16 | Yoko Sugata | 10153996208340950_10153996441105950 | Trump is a man child who has no idea what the hell he's talking about. Big fail. I was tortured for 90 minutes listening to his ramblings and every time I wanted to throw up, Hillary brought me back to the world of intelligence. Big win for Hillary last night and all the other debates.
17 | William Calabrese | 10153996208340950_10153996575500950 | All you libertards here the facts killiary Clinton is a fraud!!! If you don't like it piss off!! Today, the FBI admitted that Hillary Clinton endangered the American people‚Äîand confirmed that the worst things any of us imagined about Hillary‚Äôs email server were true.FBI Director James Comey concluded that Clinton was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù in handling our nation‚Äôs secrets.He admitted that no reasonable person could have believed putting these emails on a private server was at all appropriate or acceptable.He admitted that 110 emails on the server were classified at the time they were sent‚Äîshowing that Hillary not only lied, but knowingly endangered national security as Secretary of State.He admitted that Hillary deleted work-related emails before turning them over to the State Department, despite her claims otherwise.And most shocking, Mr. Comey even admitted that it‚Äôs likely foreign governments hacked her emails--and that our adversaries could know critical secrets about the U.S. government because of Hillary‚Äôs actions.But when you‚Äôre a Clinton, none of this matters. Not when you have the ear of the President, or you can call a secret airport meeting with the Attorney General. Not when you behave as if you‚Äôre above the law, and will never be held responsible for your actions.Mr. Comey admitted that someone caught in a similar situation would ‚Äúoften‚Äù be punished. And yet, he announced the FBI would not recommend criminal charges for Hillary Clinton.It‚Äôs not just a miscarriage of justice, but a blow to the very heart of our democracy. This is a shameful day for the rule of law and the security of our nation, no matter what your political beliefs may be.The Obama Administration might be circling the wagons, and doing all they can to prop up their corrupt, incompetent, untrustworthy Democratic nominee‚Äîbut the American people know better. And if our government won‚Äôt make her face consequences, voters will.
18 | T.R. Williams | 10153996208340950_10153996215775950 | Trump 2016, because 40 years of corrupt lying Hillary is enough.

20 | Charlotte Williams | 10153996208340950_10153996244725950 | I want the Constitution upheld. It protects every American. It doesn't matter if they are LGBTQ, women, a certain race, etc...
21 | Jodi Sauter | 10153996208340950_10153996513380950 | What about standing up for a rape victim? Oh that's right....you got the rapist off.
22 | Thomas Pohanish | 10153996208340950_10153996358690950 | It takes an act of congress before someone is appointed to the supreme court. The president can only recommend an canadate

Sometimes family members can be the harshest critics.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Justin L. Whitley | 10153996188350950_10153996205115950 | Stephen Baldwin is a right wing, extremist religious bigot. He's insane and generally has no clue what he's talking about. There's some obvious jealousy there seeing as Alec is a billion times more talented and successful than he is.
2 | Olson Freddy | 10153996188350950_10153996193305950 | Actually, it is funny. And clever. Stop being peanut butter and jelly
3 | Sheryl Minns | 10153996188350950_10153996213005950 | Yeah, but stephen is a well-known right-wing Christian. He's gonna throw his brother under a bus and tell himself it's for a Godly cause. #iamanastylady
4 | Alan Fousel | 10153996188350950_10153996194735950 | Guess there's a reason he's not the famous one.  Also, pretty hilarious of him to choose politics over fucking family.  Haha.
5 | Sherraine Green | 10153996188350950_10153996576435950 | Alec Baldwin has been nothing but FUNNY and On point as Trump on Saturday Night Live!  Trump should wish he was as funny! The brother needs to pipe down, because to many of us that have laughed we disagree!
6 | Brett Feinblatt | 10153996188350950_10153996499360950 | I guess funny depends on your politics and sanity. The farther to the right you go, the worse your sense of humor.You can see that easily enough in the downward slide Dennis Miller took after changing sides, or that crazy blonde who went full Talibangelical after SNL.
7 | Antoinette Diggins Brennan | 10153996188350950_10153996592785950 | Looking in from Ireland I think he does a brilliant personation of mr trump ....but my god after watching the final debate last night he should really just call it quits and walk away ...he really doesn't do or say anything to help himself
8 | Gail Holmes | 10153996188350950_10153996566695950 | At this point we all ask "Who is Stephen Baldwin and why did he think he needed to comment?" Now he's got his 2 seconds of fame, let's move along. Alec knew which button to press, üòÇ.
9 | Joshua AJ Hardin | 10153996188350950_10153996493905950 | When was Stephen Baldwin ever relevant? Btw, Bio Dome was one of the worst movies ever made. Compared to Alec he is a washed up, has been, D list actor.
10 | Brian C Laverenz | 10153996188350950_10153996479900950 | Well... Let's be Honest... The SNL Skits are meant to be Derogatory toward Trump and Insult his supporters.....If you believe anything else well you are just fooling yourself....
11 | Valarie Jessica Rodarte | 10153996188350950_10153996234490950 | Is he the one that was in Biodome & The Flintstones? Literally the only two movies I can remember him in.
12 | Huns Core | 10153996188350950_10153996218145950 | if HiLIARy is not nasty, why her daughter looks not like clinton but Hubbell?, if she is not nasty, why she insulted the women her husband insulted? if she is not nasty,why she deleted 33,000 emails ,if she is not nasty, why she left 4 American men dead without helping them,.........she is a liar as Obama said: she only talks but never can do ...https://youtu.be/UoE73WNoCXo
13 | Carol Roy | 10153996188350950_10153996709855950 | Well when I watched Trump I couldn't get Alec Baldwin out of my mind...when Trump interrupted with his wrong I kept waiting for him to say wronger...
14 | Glenn Feitelson | 10153996188350950_10153996195875950 | Stephen should try to not be *that brother". If he's gonna be a cartoon, I prefer Barney Rubble.
15 | Jess Lanning | 10153996188350950_10153996606420950 | Alec is great. Stephen hasn't been in anything good since The Usual Suspects and let's face it, no one watches that for Stephen Baldwin.
16 | Luis Angel Diaz Feliciano | 10153996188350950_10153996522665950 | This article is bullshit!!!...he was interviewed by Chuck Todd and he said he could'nt be prouder so this reporter who ever he is is writting bullshit!!!
17 | Madison Riley | 10153996188350950_10153996267640950 | I don't like Alec Baldwin, but his Trump impersonation is spot on and funny as hell!!
18 | Vivien Fajardo | 10153996188350950_10153996284330950 | I think Alec is hilarious as Donald trump no matter what Stephen thinks
19 | Patricia Resetar | 10153996188350950_10153996556370950 | When Don's your candidate, of course you're not going to like the portrayal...non-story.
20 | Susan Hahn | 10153996188350950_10153996506890950 | Stephen is entitled to his opinion, and I to mine: #ImWithAlec
21 | Erick C√≥rtez | 10153996188350950_10153996298590950 | Did not know he had brother! Must not be famous and wants his 15 seconds of fame
22 | Chris Kel | 10153996188350950_10153996199700950 | It isn't very funny. It's hilarious!!
23 | Jay Villaluna | 10153996188350950_10153996340800950 | Compared to Alec, Stephen Baldwin is a hack without talent.
24 | Jeremy Onyshczak | 10153996188350950_10153996666340950 | And we should care what the 4th best Baldwin brother thinks, why?
25 | Jenny Galvez | 10153996188350950_10153996708625950 | And Stephen Baldwin isn't as funny or famous as his brother,....so.....

Searches for this word spiked after Donald J. Trump unexpectedly used it during the final presidential debate.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Matthew Emerson | 10153996166005950_10153996175955950 | Someone should mention how well the moderator did, kept it fair and surprisingly unbiased.
2 | Sheryl Minns | 10153996166005950_10153996205835950 | They aren't only confused by that word! üòÇ There's not a word that comes out of his mouth that makes sense! The man is so unstable he can't even finish a sentence. #iamanastylady
3 | Lee Salisbury IV | 10153996166005950_10153996169135950 | Lol the words were BIG LEAGUE! NOT Bigly! I swear Clinton and her media buddies will take ANYTHING and run with it! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
4 | K Wms Pyke | 10153996166005950_10153996358955950 | The only confusion is how a slum Lord, opportunistic, reality TV show host, racist, sexist pumpkin man made it this far for the most important job in the country.
5 | Darlene Raunio | 10153996166005950_10153996364745950 | I still question whether he really graduated college or if his daddy paid for his diploma because Trump's ability to speak is limited to a grammar school education (someone ought to loan him a dictionary, better yet, a thesaurus too).
6 | Pamela Mendel | 10153996166005950_10153996172780950 | Clinton Broadcasting service a.k.a CBS. Once again you're not being neutral with your political reports
7 | Sarah Johnson | 10153996166005950_10153996459085950 | Hillary Clinton contradicts herself. She only tells people what she thinks they want to hear. SHE is the puppet. How can you be so concerned with toddlers lives but in the next breath, agree with long term abortion?! She says free college, but taxes won't go up? If it smells like crap, looks like crap, it is CRAP!
8 | Marilyn Lukas | 10153996166005950_10153996408090950 | How quickly we forget!  If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten.  If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

Let's focus on the real facts. The real issues.

14 | Kim Kirkland-Hebert | 10153996166005950_10153996474770950 | Instead focus on Hillary's evil smiles, laughs and her continued lies. Anyone stupid enough to believe this woman gives a care for anyone but her own agenda shouldn't be old enough to vote. All lies!
15 | Caze Oliveira | 10153996166005950_10153996219020950 | Word? Im terribly confused thinking of why anyone would support this man to be the major leader of this nation which suppose to be a honor and not a joke.
16 | Debbie Tidwell South | 10153996166005950_10153996468900950 | So here's the REAL story. Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers: share this, if you want i can send it to you
17 | Mike Rapposelli | 10153996166005950_10153996394380950 | No confusion he was talking about the Mexican drug lord's, Some of you people realize hiw bad this situation is we have US cities that actually have warning signs that US citizens should not enter because of the Mexican drug cartel.  So he should have called them something mych worse !!!!
18 | Byjantie Sewsankar | 10153996166005950_10153996446795950 | Right after Clinton used 'debunked' he used it too last night!! He did not say "big league'...as if 'bigly' wasn't bad enough please explain how big league was appropriately used??
19 | Rebecca Hogan | 10153996166005950_10153996532895950 | Trump really needs to talk to some doctors, maybe an ob-gyn or two, so he can be educated on a womans body and abortion. The ignorance is running rampant!!!
20 | Paula Harvey | 10153996166005950_10153996669790950 | I'm certainly glad this is all you can find on him for the debate. When Hillary is up there and talking about a 4yr old boy ravaged by such violence with a bloody face and said this has to stop, hmmmm well she believes in partial birth abortion so what does she think that looks like...a doctor pulls the head out and stabs the baby in the head with a blunt sharp object i don't know but that is pure violence she has blood all over her hands, killing he innocent of innocent and it ain't women's health either.... what a lie
21 | Maxine Mercer | 10153996166005950_10153996431075950 | Oh big fat hairy deal...from his hair to the way he breaths ..to every far he lets..he is critically viewed...he has the house and Senate worried. .and rightly so..I can see him naming names and telling us finally who the do nothing..but give me a raise people are..just sayin..
22 | Jodi Sauter | 10153996166005950_10153996399540950 | Life must really suck when all you have to do is pick apart words of a person. This country is going down the toilet. Actions of the political world have let this country go so far off the tracks. Some people don't see the damage that has been done all they want to do is continue the damage.
23 | Jennifer Lloyd | 10153996166005950_10153996556405950 | How about Hillary Clinton saying her entire campaign she would have open borders, last night she said she would not have open borders. So what the heck is she going to do? She doesn't even KNOW!!!
24 | Elaine Balasco Morton | 10153996166005950_10153996498610950 | I wasn't confused at all.. Hombre means man... He essentially said we have some bad men crossing the border illegally...what is so hard to understand about that?
25 | Doris Noel | 10153996166005950_10153996697260950 | Please for the love of humanity do not vote for Trump. If your thinking of voting for him you shoud just stay home on election day because when he loses then you can say you did not vote for him. Dont stress your self out over such a rotten person.

Mark Zuckerberg provided several reasons why someone, such as Thiel, would support Donald J. Trump.

There're no other reasons. When the man's ideas of negativity outstands the good, there are no good reasons..

He hasn't the first clue the job duties of being president. The president of the United States needs to be a diplomat. I don't want my country in Russias pocket and that's what voting trump will get us.
3 | Curtis Newkirk | 10153996067605950_10153996149500950 | Wouldn't it be cool if people based their vote on what the candidate wanted to do for the country, and not what they thought they were going to get for thier vote?  47% of America wants to remain tax free or on government support, so they're going to vote Hillary.  3% are more concerned about the bathroom of their choice, so it's Clinton all the way.  1% just want to see the whole thing burned to the ground, so Hillary wins, stupid continues, and the end begins.

8 | Christopher J Foster | 10153996067605950_10153996144900950 | He's full of shit, he can pretend to celebrate diversity of opinion (which I'm all about) but then why does Facebook BLOCK/BAN ANYONE who criticizes Islam in any way shape or form, even who you do it in a respectful polite researched educated way as I have, and I've been blocked 6 times for doing so. My crime according to Facebook? Criticizing a religion, exercising my free speech the right way with no hate or vulgarity just historical facts and a viewpoint. Facebook is full of it when it comes to this issue, for example regarding what I've just addressed, compared to a time when I was told by a Muslim who was angered that I stated a historical fact about Mohammed's last marriage to his wife Aisha (that he began a sexual relationship with her at the age of 9) that I should be killed and he described how in detail and that all atheist are worse than murderers and he said he was going to burn a church and Facebook said his comments did not violate their community standards. Yet had anyone ANYONE said that about a mosque they would be blocked immediately or hell even simply point out historical facts. Facebook should start truly supporting diversity of opinion and free speech, right now they support edited free speech that fits into a politically correct liberal mold. True liberalism supports true freedom of speech for all, because that's the basic of what makes western society free.
9 | Jefferson Neo | 10153996067605950_10153996319280950 | Posted by: Unknown I Remember Why We ALL Despised Her SO Much Back Then... Those that refuse to learn from the lessons of history are condemned to repeat them:   How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care.Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection.After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations.She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply.She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation.Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense.Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . .She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?)After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"Source:copy/paste......wish I could take credit for this eloquent recap of Historical events

One exchange from the final presidential debate set social media on fire... and it was about puppets. http://cbsn.ws/2drM5NV
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Joyce Bertossi-Storm | 10153996026370950_10153996133580950 | Hillary is not forcing anyone to have an abortion, and men need to grow a uterus before talking about abortion. By the way, I'm against abortion (had one when I was 15, that I regret to this day), but I also believe a woman has a right to do whatever she wants with HER own body.
2 | Jorge W DeQueiroz | 10153996026370950_10153996045980950 | No trust in hrc, msm and cronies.What BO/HRC have done to Chelsea Manning, Snowden and Assange show we have no rights and freedom of the press and speech. We live in a totalitarian State of a kleptocracy.I'm no great DT fan but the allegations of outright msm pro-hrc PR campaign and avoidance of hrc's destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice, lies and scandals published by Wikileaks which are far more grave make me certain that the only way to see the truth is to alternate power.
3 | Wanda Upton Watkins | 10153996026370950_10153996146575950 | The only puppet on stage that is a proven puppet is Hillary. .Saudi Arabia owned, sold our urianum to Russia,  wants global economy  with no birders..wikileak proves this...and if you buy the bs about Russia hacking her and changing those emails. ..you are in serious denial of the Clinton elites agendas.
4 | William J Adkins | 10153996026370950_10153996745035950 | Trump might be a lot of things, but he is definitely not a puppet. The bought and paid for crooked politician spouting that is laughable.
5 | Stephanie Rohr Turner | 10153996026370950_10153996709375950 | That was a powerful and most likely true statement. Putin would love to have Trump in office because he knows Trump is an idiot and he can use him.
6 | Brandon Still | 10153996026370950_10153996049290950 | Donald J. Trump says Mexico is going to pay for the wall, but when he met with the Mexican president "he choked," Hillary Clinton says. Lol
7 | William Calabrese | 10153996026370950_10153996627630950 | All you libertards here the facts killiary Clinton is a fraud!!! If you don't like it piss off!! Today, the FBI admitted that Hillary Clinton endangered the American people‚Äîand confirmed that the worst things any of us imagined about Hillary‚Äôs email server were true.FBI Director James Comey concluded that Clinton was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù in handling our nation‚Äôs secrets.He admitted that no reasonable person could have believed putting these emails on a private server was at all appropriate or acceptable.He admitted that 110 emails on the server were classified at the time they were sent‚Äîshowing that Hillary not only lied, but knowingly endangered national security as Secretary of State.He admitted that Hillary deleted work-related emails before turning them over to the State Department, despite her claims otherwise.And most shocking, Mr. Comey even admitted that it‚Äôs likely foreign governments hacked her emails--and that our adversaries could know critical secrets about the U.S. government because of Hillary‚Äôs actions.But when you‚Äôre a Clinton, none of this matters. Not when you have the ear of the President, or you can call a secret airport meeting with the Attorney General. Not when you behave as if you‚Äôre above the law, and will never be held responsible for your actions.Mr. Comey admitted that someone caught in a similar situation would ‚Äúoften‚Äù be punished. And yet, he announced the FBI would not recommend criminal charges for Hillary Clinton.It‚Äôs not just a miscarriage of justice, but a blow to the very heart of our democracy. This is a shameful day for the rule of law and the security of our nation, no matter what your political beliefs may be.The Obama Administration might be circling the wagons, and doing all they can to prop up their corrupt, incompetent, untrustworthy Democratic nominee‚Äîbut the American people know better. And if our government won‚Äôt make her face consequences, voters will.
8 | Yoko Sugata | 10153996026370950_10153996442395950 | Trump is a man child who has no idea what the hell he's talking about. Big fail.

14 | Michael S Cope | 10153996026370950_10153996041640950 | Questions We All Should Ponder And Consider.If Hillary is proud of her record why are people still suffering?If Hillary has been in Government over a 30 year period why have we not seen an end to corruption?If Hillary could have made America great why has she not done it already?If Hillary has no respect for the conservative party why does she have the support of the Bush family?If Hillary could have brought jobs back why has she not helped to get it done before now?If Hillary believes that Putin and the Russians are helping Trump why can she not provide clear and absolute proof?If Hillary was not the cause of riots durring Trump rallies why did she not address it and deny it?Hillary knows drugs are destorying our future generations yet she skipped addressing that issue, WHY?Look folks Hillary has had her chance at running foreign policy.Yet we are waging war now because of her lack of understanding on the world stage and how to deal with threats.So how is she going to actually face down our enemies, protect our nation, and end the threats from our enemies, when she couldn't even protect our nations amassador? Hillary says we should take in Syrian refugees yet even government officials state we cannot properly vet the folks comming in.How can she expect to keep our nation safe and support such efforts when we are told time after time her statement is completely untrue?How can she say she is going to help our folks with jobs when her husband supported NAFTA that took away our jobs in the first place?She also supports the TPP which would further destroy our economy so how can she promise to provide jobs?Hey here is an idea, perhaps Trump intends to create more jobs by sending illegals out of the nation.We will need pilots, Bus drivers, more police officers etc.  Toget it done. Those Jobs would immediately put folks back to work.Then he could have other's work on the border wall.Hmm Something that would have a positive effect on lives families and the economy.But let's move forward.How can Hillary support killing a baby at birth yet cannot support holding criminals accountable and sending them back to the nation they came from to begin with?How is it Hillary supported a wall on the border then calls Trump a racist for a policy she herself supported?How can Hillary claim to respect the rule of law, then while we have our backs turned break that law over and over then expect us to trust her?Hillary said Trump would have far too many cops on the streets.Yet she and Obama and her husband have used cops to create their own police state.Her record proves who she is and who she is not franly she is not a leader. She is nothing more than a criminal thug who needs to be in prison. It's plain and simple folks she wants to end our nation as we know it through pushing the Bush family agenda and legacy.Who are you going to trust? A 30 plus year political official or a guy who admits he is human But truely wants to help our nation?In the end We must ask these questions and We must decide who has proven themselves to be a liar, or someone who has everything he needs who is just stepping up to help our nation. One more thingWhy did Hillary give out publically our nuclear reaction time?Isn't that a state secret? Do you want our enemies to know such secrets? Seems she is still trying to seel our nation down the road.You have a lot to think about America let's set our pride to the side and do what is right for our nation.

I wanna build a wall we stop the drugs, we have some bad bad people , I wanna build a wall we have some bad hombres here" hahaha Who in the hell talks like this????Hahahaha
4 | Gary Basham | 10153995983075950_10153995996775950 | The goal is to persuade undecided voters. They have all heard about Benghazi, Bill Clinton, her health, the lie about the 12 year old rape victim, emails, super predator, etc. they already have a formed opinion on those topics. What people want to hear is policy, substance, and how he would govern. Why keep repeating the same crap? It's not like any of that is a new revelation. Trump failed to address issues or answer the questions he was asked. You are an idiot if you think bringing up stuff that has been repeated for years will convince ANY undecided voters. It's not an insult contest.Of course his ignorant supporters think he won because he made them happy. He did NOTHING to attract any undecided voters. Therefore, he really lost. He cannot win the election with ONLY uneducated white voters. It's mathematically impossible.
5 | Anthony Mike | 10153995983075950_10153995992785950 | Made up my mind and even though I do not like either, you Trump are a scumbag!
6 | Rod Sprayberry | 10153995983075950_10153996039130950 | Do you really think calling people names makes you better? Or are you just projecting... there has been enough mud slinging honestly!
7 | Gary Basham | 10153995983075950_10153996024545950 | Can anyone tell me without mentioning Hillary, what part of Trump's performance tonight would convince an undecided voter that he is fit and qualified to be president?
8 | Eileen Marie | 10153995983075950_10153996497320950 | I enjoy hearing his proper use of the English language. He uses a variety of words that people have had to look up, as reported by the media,  however, no surprise because he is an educated man. I also find it interesting when he puts thoughts in very simple terms like "bad men" he is ridiculed. Sounds like his answers (words) are chosen to reach many walks of life.
9 | Miki Ruppert - Cornette | 10153995983075950_10153996024780950 | I'm so tired of this whole catdog scenario with these two!!! That was a nickelodeon show from the 90's seen it! It's like these two attach themselves to each and constantly snap at each other with nonsense! Never seen such a childish more obnoxious election as this one! Well...nonetheless in real life the dog always wins the fight!
10 | Chris Gray | 10153995983075950_10153996558160950 | Well just because we probably never heard the work before does't mean it was used incorrectly.Hillary uses big lawyer terms that half of her followers don't know either !!!People need to quit analizing every little thing and look at the goal of "Make America Great "again... ;)
11 | Mary L Campbell Barron | 10153995983075950_10153996527095950 | There is actual news to report----like about the tapes that have been released proving Dem election fraud, the scandals in her emails, the furniture and other items she stole from the White House & State Dept, her plan to raise taxes, and on and on.
12 | John Maniz | 10153995983075950_10153996617270950 | Really this is what you are reporting on?? Instead of one of the plethora of Hillary/DNC scandal??? Can you say Veritas??? The ting leader visited the White House over 300 times!!! REally!!! But you report on a word????

13 | Jorge W DeQueiroz | 10153995983075950_10153996304345950 | Cbs PR for hrc  ... No trust in hrc, msm and cronies.What BO/HRC have done to Chelsea Manning, Snowden and Assange show we have no rights and freedom of the press and speech. We live in a totalitarian State of a kleptocracy that blames all our problems on Russia in public and in private settles uranium deals with them.I'm no great DT fan but the allegations of outright msm pro-hrc PR campaign and avoidance of hrc's destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice, lies and scandals published by Wikileaks which are far more grave make me certain that the only way to see the truth is to alternate power.
14 | Shari Heath | 10153995983075950_10153996570475950 | I don't believe Trump actually went to college.  Either Daddy's money bought little Donnie a degree or he paid someone to take his exams for him.
15 | Sean Grealey | 10153995983075950_10153996488110950 | I just want to address something that Hillary just spoke (or lied) about during the debate...LATE TERM ABORTION or PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION.  Hilary got all serious saying that she has  spoken with mothers who have had to make the worst decision of their life when they had to choose to abort their full term baby due to their own health problems.  Well, HILARY, what you failed to tell people is that a baby at that point in the pregnancy has a VERY GOOD chance of surviving if delivered (alive)!  The argument that late term abortion should be legalized if the mother's life is in danger is a false argument!  If the mother's life is in danger, all they have to do is deliver the baby and give it a chance to survive on it's own!  Why on earth would we kill it?  If you don't know what PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION consists of, take a look at this visual.  They deliver the baby (legs first) but pay close attention to make sure the head isn't delivered.  Then they take a pair of scissors and stab the baby in the back of the neck/head.  They, then, suction out the baby's brains and then remove the rest of the baby from the birth canal.  Why do they pay close attention to leave the head in the birth canal?  Because if they deliver the head and THEN stab it in the back of the neck, they will be charged with MURDER!!  How is that for double standards???  Seriously, this is the worst kind of abortion that there is and Hillary wants it to be legalized!!!  She kills me, how she gets on tv and talks about being an advocate for the "children" and how she always has been.  She's a fraud, people, and I don't understand how anyone can believe her lies!  (Below is an excerpt from Florida RIght to Life website concerning Partial Birth Abortion in the second / third trimester)Surgical, Second and Third Trimester: Partial-Birth Abortion Abortionists sometimes refer to these or similar types of abortions using obscure, clinical-sounding euphemisms such as ‚ÄúDilation and Extraction‚Äù (D&X), or ‚Äúintact D&E‚Äù (IDE) which mask the realities of how the abortions are actually performed.24 This procedure is used to abort women who are 20 to 32 weeks pregnant‚Äîor even later into pregnancy. (Many babies born at 23 weeks (gestational age) or more survive.25 Partial-birth abortion eliminates that possibility. Guided by ultrasound, the abortionist reaches into the uterus, grabs the unborn baby‚Äôs leg with forceps, and pulls the baby into the birth canal, except for the head, which is deliberately kept just inside the womb. (At this point in a partial-birth abortion, the baby is alive.) Then the abortionist jams scissors into the back of the baby‚Äôs skull and spreads the tips of the scissors apart to enlarge the wound.

The collapsed head is then removed from the uterus. 26 Partial-birth abortion is a particularly gruesome procedure. Partial-birth abortion is now prohibited in the United States under federal law.
16 | Hall Bauer S B | 10153995983075950_10153996082420950 | Keischelle Achong, You bought the lie. Trump follows the tax laws. Hillary lost $6 billion at the State Department, understated Clinton foundation income by $26 million, and deprived Haitians of over $500 million in earthquake recovery money.
17 | Dilmohammad Azizi | 10153995983075950_10153996102040950 | White House just possible for Mr trump I am not an American but I so like sweet peoples of American and I also so like will be live in We love you Trump! Please continue to do everything needed to win this in November!! I will be so proud to call you our our next president ‚ù§Ô∏è and Mr trump don't wary u r winner and u r will become new president of American for sweet peoples of American and I so support u by way of comment
18 | Gary Doan | 10153995983075950_10153996058695950 | Team Clinton paid thugs $1500 each to assault Trump supporters in Chicago - that's criminal - caught red handed - She should be hearing from the Federal Election Committee soon.- what won't they do?
19 | Keishelle Achong | 10153995983075950_10153996022310950 | And yet, Trump didn't or hasn't contributed any taxes for border security or for our US Military to fight and protect our country. But, I bet you did! Trump and his followers, "Let's make [Russia] great again!" Lol
20 | Nicollette Buck | 10153995983075950_10153996576985950 | When this is over all of the exposed ugliness and hate that we've seen in people isn't just going to disappear. I really hope people understand what they've done and how insane and self centered and disrespectful and non cooperative they've been. It would have been great if we all pulled together and honestly did the best for all of us. But that's not what's happened here. We've only seen ugliness and hatred and plain disgusting human beings. I think we've really seen Americas true colors. Many of us should be truly ashamed and maybe if we didn't lack humility and common decency this period of history would have done more than split us up. You cant try to throw blame at anyone else or the media, this was a complete lack of decent character on the peoples part.Humble yourselves and you'll be amazed by what doors will open. Stop trying to be "right" on the Internet to make yourself feel good and be more concerned and about doing what IS ACTUALLY right. Ego on the Internet is seriously out of control. The Internet has become a reason and excuse to be a god awful person without any true consequences. While you've behaved this way our children have been watching, learning, molded to some degree, remember that. Many Americans have been no one to follow and things like sexual assault have been normalized and openly accepted and brushed aside. When our children take over, this is the example you have set for them to follow. You've left behind a shitty world but many won't take responsibility because their ego and pride comes before reality and the state of the world. Such a selfish place this has become.
21 | Mark Scanlan | 10153995983075950_10153996031660950 | I am ashamed to find out that Donald Trump knows words that I don't.
22 | Valerie Gregory | 10153995983075950_10153996459790950 | Really!? All the news going on this is what yall report on. Sounds like yall got a elementary school news reporter writing on the debate.
23 | M Emily Onglatco | 10153995983075950_10153995990885950 | I'm probably being nasty when I guffawed after he said, and repeated, bigly.
24 | Michael G Clark | 10153995983075950_10153996132045950 | I watch this debate CBS.....i think Trump is the  clear winner.....sentiment. Apart......his policies are ok....am an undecided voter....i will vote Trump ...made up my mind
25 | Hall Bauer S B | 10153995983075950_10153996068930950 | Gary Basham, You want to hear about policy and substance? Those are good ideals. Hillary has already stated, and demonstrated, that she has public and private positions. Public positions get her the votes. Private positions are the backroom deals she negotiates, usually contradictory to her public positions. Most Americans would call that duplicity. Hillary calls it, Balance.

Yes, it‚Äôs after Labor Day. And yes, that makes white sort of a fashion faux pas. But when Hillary Clinton hit the stage in Vegas for the final presidential debate, social media users went wild for her white pantsuit.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Noreen Manvell | 10153995934470950_10153995938475950 | Nobody cares about white after Labor Day anymore. That went away several years ago. She looked fabulous. And Trump, as usual, was wearing an ill fitting suit that made his butt look big and a too long tie.
2 | Pamela Beecher | 10153995934470950_10153995948525950 | She wore what is called "winter white" which is more of a cream and often worn after Labor Day! People she knows what she's doing.
3 | Lynn Roberge | 10153995934470950_10153995939780950 | I challenge Democrats, Independents and Republicans to look up Project Veritas and Wikileaks to see what type of dishonest and corrupt campaign Hillary has been running. PS She careS more about illegals than she does OUR VETS AND HOMELESS
4 | Stephanie Yakich | 10153995934470950_10153996323545950 | Mrs Clinton wore red for the first debate, navy blue for the second debate, and wore the cream ( the new white ) for the third debate. She wore the colors of the American flag, for all of the American people, as she has said from the beginning, this is for all of America.
5 | Crystal Gardner Cheaves | 10153995934470950_10153995959305950 | I did not see the American flag on Anywhere in her suit? And she wants to be President. Trump is going to win, Americans can see past all the democrats cheating and lies. Hillary is the queen of lies. Trump might not be as polished a debater as Hillary, or might not know every bad guys name in the middle east, but atleast he will stand up for our Country. We also have confirmed that Hillary has no problem KILLING a 9 month fully developed baby. We also know Hillary should not have been able to run for President in the first place and if the FBI would do their job she would be in prison!Enough brainwashing by Hillary. Donald Trump will protect our Constitutional Rights üá∫üá∏

7 | Julie Mathers | 10153995934470950_10153995938970950 | Looked like it came out of the closet of Dr. Evil..
8 | Donovan Thomas | 10153995934470950_10153995983565950 | No they didn't ... and while your at it bring up that she also told the whole world the response time to launch nuclear weapons for the us....
9 | Carolyn Houston | 10153995934470950_10153996026175950 | Hillary looked great, so what she wore white, get over it! Trump supporters blame her for everything. What about his orange hair, what the hell does he put on it , he probably dyes it, looks horrible. Hillary won the debate, she is so much smarter than him and he can't stand it. Go Hillary!
10 | Joe Hanson | 10153995934470950_10153995956995950 | If you vote for trump then you are a racist and unpatriotic period. Anyone who votes for trump is going to be labeled as a racist, and unpatriotic, because no one in their right mind will vote for him, he's a racist, a bigot and a danger to this country. He couldn't even respect our democratic process which have existed for 240 years. What a shame. So we are going to know all the racist and unpatriotic people in this country, and the world is watching.
11 | Kelly Benevedes | 10153995934470950_10153996618885950 | She looks fat because someone isnt fitting her in pantsuit cut to enhance her body type...its all wrong and the bullshit of wearing white aftet labor day doesnt really matter to anyone theze days and no one cares if it Winter White or Marshmallow Frosting, she can and should do better.
12 | Judith Mike Cook | 10153995934470950_10153996386870950 | Hillary, true to corrupt career politicians, talked fast and over the top of everyone...lies and contradictions rolled out of her mouth as smooth as silk. She lied about wanting open borders, she lied about compassion for the children (she supports all abortions)..she lied about Russia, she lied about rigging the election and violence at the Trump rallies, she lied about the Clinton Foundation, she lied about her experience...Hell...what DIDN'T she lie about?.
13 | Diana Fischer | 10153995934470950_10153996712050950 | Why TF does anyone care what she wore to the debate? Has there EVER been an article about the suit any other candidate has worn? No. Because they were male, and instead of talking about what a female says, thinks or does, all that matters in our society is how she looks doing it. SMH.
14 | Lora Grigonis | 10153995934470950_10153996457505950 | It was part of her theme. over the three debates she wore red, blue (actually it was blue and white) and white. Like the colors of our flag.
15 | Huns Core | 10153995934470950_10153996181615950 | Nasty means:  she could avoid her from FBI prosecution, she /her husband/obama could instruct their system to do anything ! Horrible !

18 | Yvette Connelly | 10153995934470950_10153996664050950 | She looks terrible in anything she wears. Her make up is heavily applied to cover her paleness or Ashley skin from whatever disease she's hiding and she looked terrible. She is hideous.
19 | Connie Swan Conrad | 10153995934470950_10153996731425950 | Hey that is Winter White she is wearing!  I hope she finds a coat in that color for the innaugeration.  It looks great on her!

1 | Olivia Katie | 10153995882800950_10153995913695950 | Well Hillary fu&ked up big with that late term abortion statement. Being a mother of two children that statement really hit me. My doctor tried to get me to have an abortion, because she said "I was still young". I am so happy I didn't. Just for that I have know other option but to vote for Trump. Screw you liberal media!!!
2 | Crystal Gardner Cheaves | 10153995882800950_10153995908000950 | Trump is going to win, Americans can see past all the democrats cheating and lies. Hillary is the queen of lies.

3 | Joseph Harris | 10153995882800950_10153995919270950 | Watching Clinton panic and run away from the pay to play question leaves no doubt she's as guilty as they get and anyone thinking she has no debts to pay once she's president and won't continue with the pay to play scheme is a fool.
4 | James L. Greenlee | 10153995882800950_10153995913935950 | What an absurd metric, Trump is the clear winner because more people were TALKING about him? You need the context of what was said, much of which was astonishment at his nuttiness.
5 | Amber Rose | 10153995882800950_10153995937765950 | I voted on every poll I could find and Trump was the winner on them all. I'm sure the media will manipulate them later, but they were all trump !!!!!
6 | Armando Tauceda | 10153995882800950_10153995890605950 | The liberal media cheers for Hillary.It's over the top.Hundreds of stories bashing Trump,24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
7 | Donovan Thomas | 10153995882800950_10153996015030950 | Clinton told the whole world the response time of launching nuclear weapons from the us... 4 min... I don't think she is the one that should be in charge... seems classified info just keeps leaking out of her pie hole !
8 | Jennifer Bishop Spencer | 10153995882800950_10153995948805950 | I studied to be a broadcast journalist as well as print news journalist way back in college. What you people do is not journalism. Well, it is YELLOW journalism at it's worst. True journalists have integrity and morals and report facts from both sides equally and keep their opinions out. Lucky for me I got out of the industry quickly and went into one that made a real difference in the lives of children because all you do is make Americans more divided and more hateful with your Lame Stream News. You should be ashamed of yourselves!
9 | George Inashvili | 10153995882800950_10153995933390950 | Garry Kasparov47 mins ¬∑ The commentators are missing the point that the two most outrageous moments of tonight's debate are directly connected. Trump's unprecedented declaration that he may not accept the results of the election and his absolute refusal to put the blame on Putin's Russia for hacking or anything else are both scandalous, but they not separate positions at all.The goal of Putin's propaganda and cyberattacks are to discredit American democracy, to make Americans fear and hate each other and to distrust the very system that makes the United States such a powerful force in the world. This also serves Putin well domestically, where Russian news, all state controlled, is full of announcements about the US election being rigged, despite a total lack of evidence to the contrary. If even America's elections are fake, goes their argument, how can anyone complain about Russia's sham elections?Tonight Trump announced himself loud and clear to be an agent of Putin's goals to destabilize the United States and its democratic process. He constantly repeats Russian propaganda that America is weak and corrupt. Then Trump demonstrated that he is fiercely loyal to Putin, beyond any possible political advantage. These two positions go together. Trump is Putin's stooge and he just confessed to it on stage in Las Vegas.
10 | Lori Adams | 10153995882800950_10153995936660950 | Opposed to what the democrats, liberals and media would have you believe about our country being based on a peaceful transfer of power, our country actually was based on the peoples right to overthrow a corrupt government. It was considered our duty. In addition, the first contested presidency was the third election and took place in 1796 and it was contested by the hot headed, Thomas Jefferson. Check the facts!
11 | Jenny Wiersma | 10153995882800950_10153995995695950 | I feel Trump did a good job on calling Hillary out on her corruptness. She did not even try to deny the facts. He still did not impress me with facts on what and how he is gonna "Make America Great Again!", but I'm feeling better then I was about giving him my vote. Cause Hillary can't win!I'm really annoyed with the media and people getting all worked up with Trump for saying he may question the results of the election if he loses. I honestly wouldn't blame him. Let's look at The Clintons... there foundation is corrupt, they are adulterers, they've already been impeached, they are pathological liars, they get away with crimes you or I would be put in jail for, and the list goes on. So my thought is... With someone as corrupt as Hillary Clinton running against him, who can find a way of staying out of jail and is still even aloud to be running for president ... I don't blame him for questioning the results if he loses! The Clintons are as corrupt as they get and will do what ever they have to do to get what they want and win this election.
12 | Chris Dessources | 10153995882800950_10153995911060950 | No matter how many times Hillary defeats Trump, his loyal Trumpalets will keep their heads in the sand. I already know Hillary won. I'm just waiting for the official result so I can sip on some Republican tears.
13 | Jenelle Jones | 10153995882800950_10153995959830950 | The entire point of what hillary said was for women to have the choice! I didnt even watch the damn debate and I know more of what was said than you idiots. She did say late term abortions should ONLY be done for medical reasons, which I agree with. Trump said they shouldnt be allowed at all, which is completely wrong, in my opinion. And idk why you guys are getting so upset at her for what she said, people have been getting abortions for a long time and I cant believe you people are just now saying SHE will benefit from the abortions. Lmao! Whats are you thinking, how does that even make sense? Lol. Now I see why you all will vote for Trump. Careless words and nonsense sentences make up what you think are coherent thoughts but in reality is just a bunch of bullshit made up to make you sound smart lol. Have fun voting on November 28th and dont forget to keep an american flag up in your yard to remember the attack on our nation known as 7/11! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
14 | Dennis Dion McKinney | 10153995882800950_10153995941505950 | Do you remember 1987 when the Senators were giving Ollie North such a bad time? This brings it all into perspective, thought you might be interested in this forgotten bit of information.It was 1987! At a lecture the other day they were playing an old news video of Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during the Reagan Administration. There was Ollie in front of God and country getting the third degree, but what he said was stunning!He was being drilled by a senator,"did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security system?"Ollie replied, "yes Sir, I did".The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, "Isn't that just a little excessive?""No sir" continued Ollie."No, and why not?" the senator asked."Because the lives of my family and I were threatened sir"."Threatened? By whom?" the senator questioned."By a Muslim terrorist sir". Ollie answer."Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?""His name is Osama bin Laden, sir", Ollie replied.At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued. "Why are you so afraid of this man?", the senator asked."Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of", Ollie answered, "And the Muslims are trying to take over America and destroy it from the inside out and putting their people into our political offices."And what do you recommend we do about him?", asked the senator."Well, sir, if it was up to me, I would recommend that an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth."The senator disagreed with this approach, and that was all that was shown of the clip. By the way, that senator was Al Gore! Also: Terrorist pilot Mohammad Atta blew up a bus in Israel in 1986. The Israelis captured,tried and imprisoned him. As part of the Oslo agreement with the Palestinians in 1993, Israel had to agree to release so-called, "political prisoners". However, the Israelis would not release any with blood on their hands.The American President at the time, Bill Clinton, and his Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, insisted that all prisoners be released. Thus Mohammad Atta was freed and eventually thanked us by flying an airplane into Tower One of the World Trade Center. This was reported by many of the non-American TV networks at the time that the terrorists were first identified. It was censored in the US from all, pass this on!
15 | Sean Bennett | 10153995882800950_10153995942720950 | I think it's ridiculous that you base the winner of the debate based on social media popularity CBS. You trump supporters are completely delusional.
16 | Lynn Roberge | 10153995882800950_10153995949480950 | I challenge Democrats, Independents and Republicans to look up Project Veritas and Wikileaks to see what type of dishonest and corrupt campaign Hillary has been running. PS She careS more about illegals than she does OUR VETS AND HOMELESS
17 | Lucia M Yu | 10153995882800950_10153995929120950 | If anybody has common sense will know that it is impossible to abort a baby over 7 months old, the doctor will induce labor to bring the baby to this world and put it in incubator.
18 | Rebecca Taylor | 10153995882800950_10153996252420950 | CBS, are you saying that Trump won the debate because he is getting more social media coverage?  People are talking about what an unbelievable moron he is...laughable remarks, not backing him.  Getting people talking doesn't make you a winner.  The best tweet I read said Trump was like a student who had to do a book report, but never read the book, "You see there were these grapes.  They had a lot of wrath."  What a joke!!!
19 | Matthew Grimmett | 10153995882800950_10153996107250950 | Notice most of these comments, go check out the people in here are connected to Trump's page. They have to comment n each news site, because they know their getting crushed on NOV. 8th. Hillary clearly won again, and trumptards heads are exploding...üòÇüòÇ
20 | Stephanie Roby-Mattox | 10153995882800950_10153996157670950 | It's impossible to listen to this "exploded butt hole" faced man when all he talks about are the former Democratic Presidents and the praising of foreign Presidents. If he's elected his supporters will see that their quality of life will not improve unless they're already part of the haves. #MrPresidentElectGrabThemByTheP*ssy
21 | Eric Tyrone Fisher | 10153995882800950_10153996024015950 | I challenge americans if you want to change america get these bums out of congress... i dont care who you vote for they are both bums but to make america great get these cowards out of congress... get them out i dont care if i have to call trump admiral chief Sargeant emperor of the world but clean congress up. More corruption there than a nixon term.
22 | Alex Silver | 10153995882800950_10153995983535950 | After that Clinton foundation question when she looked like a complete idiot and not answered properly, which basically meant she and the foundation are corrupt and nasty, she lost it all there! She lost our votes and the race!!!
23 | Joyce Carolyn | 10153995882800950_10153996613375950 | Everyone is pissed and so tired of the polished rhetoric that means nothing. We'd rather have a flawed, unpolished blowhard than more of the same failed leanings of the current administration.
24 | Teri Plourde | 10153995882800950_10153996423125950 | Clintons late term abortion statements should send everyone on the run screaming...do you people even understand what that is? For the sake of humanity, look it up if you don't before you vote for that unfit woman...that's sheer evil.
25 | Jeanne-Joseph Green | 10153995882800950_10153996327260950 | Trump is history. The bum couldn't even lie straight and keep up with the form of questioning by the commentator. Nonetheless, Hillary Clinton is too good for this country. I really hope you Trump supporters get what you deserve in the final analysis, you reap what you sow.

The last presidential debate of 2016 is over. Here are the moments that got everyone talking: http://cbsn.ws/2drLUlM
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Stephen Saunders | 10153995825845950_10153995836700950 | There are millions of people who intend to vote for Trump who aren't voicing the fact for fear of needless confrontation.  On election day, however, their voices will ring the loudest.
2 | Matthew Emerson | 10153995825845950_10153995873435950 | Who cares if he accepts the outcome or not? I don't know how anyone could accept a pathological liar and manipulative bitch running our country.
3 | William H Kien | 10153995825845950_10153995959330950 | Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know.So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."No I did not write this, its a share of a share of share, I don't take any credit but I thought it was to hilarious that it deserved to be reshared.
4 | Laura Coleman | 10153995825845950_10153995856655950 | Here's the monments that Clinton media wants people to think everyone is talking about. Won't mention the lies Clinton told on her Foundation charity contributions, or the way they sold from Haiti, and screwed them.  How her brother got the gold mining!  Won't mention the woman that claims to be such a fighter for children, turns her back when they have their spinal cored cut in the 8 or 9 month to sell their baby parts for profit, and donations for her!
5 | Brandon Still | 10153995825845950_10153995835005950 | Donald J. Trump says Mexico is going to pay for the wall, but when he met with the Mexican president "he choked," Hillary Clinton says. Lol
6 | Lilly Cardona | 10153995825845950_10153995872705950 | It's very shocking that Hillary says that a child on its due date just hours before delivery still doesn't have constitutional rights üòï
7 | Mason Hayat | 10153995825845950_10153996456575950 | OK, let's clear this once and for all. If Trump genuiinely believes that the owners of this country don't want him in the White House so they are doing everything in their power to keep him out ( which is the exact meaning of the word rigged that he keeps using in this regards ) OK, if that is the case, then he must pull out now and make himself seriously and geniunely heard . But if he choses to wait so he " might" win as it is, then his claims are not worth a Goddamn penny.
8 | Lori Adams | 10153995825845950_10153995937135950 | Opposed to what the democrats, liberals and media would have you believe about our country being based on a peaceful transfer of power, our country actually was based on the peoples right to overthrow a corrupt government.

9 | Jerry Laughlin | 10153995825845950_10153995873695950 | ... lol, horrifying... Trump will concede but he has pride. Hillary just uses his words against him. Like really, "no, I don't agree with election but looks like Hillary is now president?" The delegates and superdelegates have way more sway than the people. When all of us vote... anything electronic is capable of being tampered with.
10 | George Inashvili | 10153995825845950_10153995934635950 | Garry Kasparov47 mins ¬∑ The commentators are missing the point that the two most outrageous moments of tonight's debate are directly connected.

11 | Johnnie Kerner | 10153995825845950_10153996027410950 | Hillary wants a hard control of guns to protect kids in the schools, but she refuse any control of abortion because ‚Äúthe unborn person doesn‚Äôt have constitutional rights‚Äù. Isn't it absurd?. Trump is pro-life, he "would support a ban on abortion methods", except - I assume - if the baby is muslim, black, asian or latino. He committed a mistake because abortions don't happen at 9 months pregnant. I read Dr. Jennifer Gunter opinion about this topic. She wrote: "Sometimes obstetricians will induce pregnancy at 36 weeks due to anencephaly (when a major portion of the brain is missing and the baby cannot survive). But that is not an abortion. It is induced labor to deliver a baby that will not live. If you rip a baby out of the mother‚Äôs womb at three days before it was due, that is a C-section. If you intentionally harm and kill the child, that is infanticide. Is it not abortion ‚Äî and it is not what Clinton has ever supported". According to Vox reports, the federal government estimates that 91.4 percent of abortions in the United States are performed in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy. An estimated 1.3 percent of abortions happen later than 21 weeks into pregnancy. And none are happening on ‚Äúthe final day‚Äù of pregnancy.
12 | Lourdes Prado | 10153995825845950_10153995908315950 | Hillary Clinton was more prepare ,her answer was more clear but on the other hand Trump wasn't focused and calling her "nasty woman"Omgggg!really in not in favor of one or the other but seriously is time for Trump to get his act together !!
13 | Deirdre Kelly | 10153995825845950_10153995876935950 | Babies can be delivered by C Section at 9 months so please tell me how an abortion saves the mothers life and a C section doesn't?
14 | Robert Beneux | 10153995825845950_10153995836375950 | still not voting for either one of these disasters... I will be damn if i have my vote goes to with one of them.not voting for someone I don't like..this election just really sucks and so disappointing..it is just awful
15 | Luis Argueta | 10153995825845950_10153995864660950 | Trump won't commit to accepting election results because he is the Biggest Loser!!! In his eyes, everything is Rigged!! So ridiculous!!!! SMH!! #neverTrump #IAmwithHer #Hillary2016
16 | Marilyn Kopecky | 10153995825845950_10153995906170950 | Gore the loser didn't concede to Bush the winner.Gore sued. Repeatedly. And he & his supporters never accepted the results.
17 | Gary Doan | 10153995825845950_10153995841550950 | Team Clinton paid thugs $1500 each to assault Trump supporters in Chicago - that's criminal - caught red handed - She should be hearing from the Federal Election Committee soon.- what won't they do?
18 | Jerry Laughlin | 10153995825845950_10153995870580950 | Lol, Trump knows his tax codes. Plus Hillary knows nothing concerning economics she'll dig a hole and be remembered as a failure as a president voted in under the liberal fad of progressiveness over common sense. $20 trillion in debt and a candidate is a part of the group of idiots who voted for War in Iraq??... she's been part of the problem.
19 | Alex Mogo | 10153995825845950_10153995883370950 | There is not enough bigot vote to beat Hillary Clinton. Get ready for a landslide. Deporables back to your caves in 20 days. #neverTrump #IAmwithHer #Hillary2016
20 | Martha Norris | 10153995825845950_10153995896400950 | No. 1  is what he wanted Marla {second wife} to do. She wouldn't so he married her 3 months after the baby was born! He's just not of the real world!!
21 | Huns Core | 10153995825845950_10153995994610950 | if HiLIARy is not nasty, why her daughter looks not like clinton but Hubbell?, if she is not nasty, why she insulted the women her husband insulted? if she is not nasty,why she deleted 33,000 emails ,if she is not nasty, why she left 4 American men dead without helping them,.........she is a liar as Obama said: she only talks but never can do ...https://youtu.be/UoE73WNoCXo
22 | Crystal Gardner Cheaves | 10153995825845950_10153995912175950 | Trump is going to win, Americans can see past all the democrats cheating and lies. Hillary is the queen of lies. Trump might not be as polished a debater as Hillary, or might not know every bad guys name in the middle east, but atleast he will stand up for our Country. We also have confirmed that Hillary has no problem KILLING a 9 month fully developed baby. We also know Hillary should not have been able to run for President in the first place and if the FBI would do their job she would be in prisonTrump 2016
23 | Jim Gavin | 10153995825845950_10153996331565950 | I really really was hoping Chris would run a fair debate, But then it started. Interrupted Donald J. Trump and wouldn't let him finish his answers and also let her pass on not answering the pay to play issue and never asked about FBI being bribed to remove classified markings from her email or about the women coming out today about bill molesting them..I guess it's just impossible for the media to be fair anymore. Congratulations bias media and corrupt government you won.
24 | Judi Thompson | 10153995825845950_10153995948200950 | I have never been so proud of Hillary. I wish she could hear me say this... So elegant, well spoken, made her points....wow.
25 | Kevin Koehler | 10153995825845950_10153996430970950 | The puppet comment is spot on ...Putin will have is way of reshaping the old USSR with Trump in office but will Putin stop there?

Searches for the word spiked 120,000% over the hourly average after Donald J. Trump used the phrase "bad hombres" during the debate.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Renee Kennedy-Hill | 10153995750055950_10153995756620950 | This idiot used bigly! I'm convinced anyone who supports this man to be President has mental health issues. This man is vile and is not qualified to be the President .
2 | Shannon Humphrey | 10153995750055950_10153995757395950 | Excellent job Chris Wallace. Nice to see a fair moderator for once and not some CNN liberal jackass.
3 | Jose Tijerino | 10153995750055950_10153995776315950 | are you telling me that most of the educated americans don't know the most basic words in spanish? that's it?
4 | Laura Coleman | 10153995750055950_10153995805790950 | Look up Wikileaks emails that Clinton has lied about, and attack millions of American over. Look up fact check, where Clinton lied about the Clinton foundation contributions. Look up the video of a top Democrat that meet in the House House over 300 times, bragging about causing chaos at the Trump rally in Chicago. You know the one, you blame Trump for creating! Mark Levin16 mins ¬∑ Wallace is wrong. Gore the loser didn't concede to Bush the winner.Gore sued. Repeatedly. And he & his supporters never accepted the results.
5 | Nick Demeray | 10153995750055950_10153995801150950 | lol a bit nervous, so there is just no difference between CNN and CBC hell pretty much all of the news media. Killary got torched, look at how desperate the media is, look at what they clearly took away from all of this just more smear campagn and here wil be lot more coming about Kilarry before this is over mark mh words. Hell today she evenhad to appologize for Shittig l over America litterlly, and I love seeing these losers having a bloody mental breakdown. TRUMP won this debate no hands down. Go Trump from Canada..... suck it Trudeau! !!!
6 | Sue Crockford-Peters | 10153995750055950_10153995772180950 | And I'm one of them. Not being a speaker of Spanish, I wanted to know what the actual definition is. Apparently, it means "man," with no pejorative or positive connotation.
7 | Alana Alana | 10153995750055950_10153995823545950 | Who would need to kill a baby at 36 weeks? If it was a hazard to a women's health they would just deliver the baby. Women should have the right to make their own health decisions but once you add a baby to the mix it's no longer just your health. It's also so funny how Hillary doesn't think once our children are born we as parents should have rights over their medical treatment! She's not for children she's for killing them!!!
8 | Darrin Richards | 10153995750055950_10153995796785950 | Clinton's looting Haiti and the Haitians. It's a fact and the moderator knew and Hillary knew and like the professional lair she is she never answered the question of course but that did not stop her from lying when Hillary said her Clinton foundation gives 90% of its money away...LIE.! Clinton's foundation gives 10% away they make bonds on the remaining Clinton cash üí∞ stock pile but they do not give more than 10% away.
9 | Steven Wiley | 10153995750055950_10153995822200950 | We have been down this road three times now.., once with Rose Perot, once with Ron Paul and the most recent was Burnie Sanders‚Ä¶ You can't listen to what the mainstream media says...

10 | Robert Stewart Asbury | 10153995750055950_10153995834680950 | Shouldn't the main point be that Hillary was so focused in the unproven idea that Putin is behind the email leaks that she refused to take responsibility for what is in them? Half of what she was saying has already been outed as lies by her own emails. You can literally fact check her against herself.
11 | Christine Wyly | 10153995750055950_10153996499130950 | Having lived in the southwestern area of the U. S. most of my life, I sprinkle Spanish words into my speech from time to time. It hadn't occurred to me that people wouldn't know the meaning of hombre. But whether the meaning was known or not, what's the stinking big deal? We are a melting pot, and words from different languages are mingled together all the time. Tex-Mex, anyone?
12 | Dave Kennedy | 10153995750055950_10153995804870950 | If Hillary Clinton Dodges and pivot anymore she should be on Dancing With the StarsI'm glad he brought up these videos.A little bit more should of been saidSHARE VIDEOS.. https://milo.yiannopoulos.net/2016/10/blackout-okeefe-ignored-mainstream/
13 | Christopher Dunham | 10153995750055950_10153996357030950 | For someone to think little Haiti in Florida is the same as the country Haiti....lmmfao just stop Mr. Trump you are really being too extra!!!!
14 | Philippe Van Reybrouck | 10153995750055950_10153995814625950 | The Secure Fence Act of 2006: The original bill specifically called for double-layer fencing across 700 miles of the border. Clinton, and 25 other Democratic senators, voted in favor of the bill.
15 | Lori Sedgwick Kesner | 10153995750055950_10153995820330950 | OMG...there is nothing but a bunch of politically correct sissies out there!!! So damn sick of it!! HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT HILLARY CALLED EVERYONE IN HER EMAILS?? GEEEZZZZZZ!! It's not about that..it's about OPEN BORDERS or no open borders, it's about killing babies or not killing babies, it's about trade agreements, it's about vetted vs. unvetted refugees, it's about higher taxes vs. lower taxes. It's about the current failed healthcare program or a reformed healthcare program...this is what people are not getting because they are to damn wrapped up in their "FEELINGS"GROW UP ALREADY!!!
16 | Gary Basham | 10153995750055950_10153996029715950 | Can anyone tell me without mentioning Hillary, what part of Trump's performance tonight would convince an undecided voter that he is fit and qualified to be president?
17 | Brett Scott | 10153995750055950_10153995763885950 | Racist Americans searching for an hombre so they can make a meme making fun of Trump while using a latino to do it...seems right.
18 | Gary Basham | 10153995750055950_10153995997900950 | The goal is to persuade undecided voters. They have all heard about Benghazi, Bill Clinton, her health, the lie about the 12 year old rape victim, emails, super predator, etc. they already have a formed opinion on those topics. What people want to hear is policy, substance, and how he would govern. Why keep repeating the same crap? It's not like any of that is a new revelation. Trump failed to address issues or answer the questions he was asked. You are an idiot if you think bringing up stuff that has been repeated for years will convince ANY undecided voters. It's not an insult contest.Of course his ignorant supporters think he won because he made them happy. He did NOTHING to attract any undecided voters. Therefore, he really lost. He cannot win the election with ONLY uneducated white voters. It's mathematically impossible.
19 | Lou Brody | 10153995750055950_10153995814940950 | I love it, the media is making a big deal out of what Trump said about accepting the out come of the election...which he said. "I will look at it at the time. I‚Äôm not looking at anything now." or about a word he said. Hillary avoids everything that incriminates her, and you don't hear the media mentioning it at all.  She didn't talk about Haiti when asked. She didn't talk about pay to play when asked. She didn't talk about the fly zone when asked. She didn't respond to the comment that Trump made about the women being paid by the Hillary campaign. She didn't respond to the comment that it was just released that Hillary's campaign paid protestors to go to Trump rallies and cause a scene. She didn't respond about giving money back to countries that treat women badly. All these things incriminate her. It shows her corruptness, her evilness, and her lies.
20 | Huns Core | 10153995750055950_10153995994270950 | if HiLIARy is not nasty, why her daughter looks not like clinton but Hubbell?, if she is not nasty, why she insulted the women her husband insulted? if she is not nasty,why she deleted 33,000 emails ,if she is not nasty, why she left 4 American men dead without helping them,.........she is a liar as Obama said: she only talks but never can do ...https://youtu.be/UoE73WNoCXo

22 | Cynthia Washburn Saturday | 10153995750055950_10153995806810950 | Hillary made Trump look like the Chump he is. #PutinsChumpTrump She had facts and he had adjectives....... Bigly..... "we're gonna do more better with Mexico..." ~from Trump's superior brain!!! LOL ;D
23 | Alice Gerard | 10153995750055950_10153995770060950 | It seems that Trump actually said "hambre," which means "hungry."
24 | Sean Grealey | 10153995750055950_10153996552880950 | I just want to address something that Hillary just spoke (or lied) about during the debate...LATE TERM ABORTION or PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION.  Hilary got all serious saying that she has  spoken with mothers who have had to make the worst decision of their life when they had to choose to abort their full term baby due to their own health problems.  Well, HILARY, what you failed to tell people is that a baby at that point in the pregnancy has a VERY GOOD chance of surviving if delivered (alive)!  The argument that late term abortion should be legalized if the mother's life is in danger is a false argument!  If the mother's life is in danger, all they have to do is deliver the baby and give it a chance to survive on it's own!  Why on earth would we kill it?  If you don't know what PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION consists of, take a look at this visual.  They deliver the baby (legs first) but pay close attention to make sure the head isn't delivered.  Then they take a pair of scissors and stab the baby in the back of the neck/head.  They, then, suction out the baby's brains and then remove the rest of the baby from the birth canal.  Why do they pay close attention to leave the head in the birth canal?  Because if they deliver the head and THEN stab it in the back of the neck, they will be charged with MURDER!!  How is that for double standards???  Seriously, this is the worst kind of abortion that there is and Hillary wants it to be legalized!!!  She kills me, how she gets on tv and talks about being an advocate for the "children" and how she always has been.  She's a fraud, people, and I don't understand how anyone can believe her lies!  (Below is an excerpt from Florida RIght to Life website concerning Partial Birth Abortion in the second / third trimester)Surgical, Second and Third Trimester: Partial-Birth Abortion Abortionists sometimes refer to these or similar types of abortions using obscure, clinical-sounding euphemisms such as ‚ÄúDilation and Extraction‚Äù (D&X), or ‚Äúintact D&E‚Äù (IDE) which mask the realities of how the abortions are actually performed.24 This procedure is used to abort women who are 20 to 32 weeks pregnant‚Äîor even later into pregnancy. (Many babies born at 23 weeks (gestational age) or more survive.25 Partial-birth abortion eliminates that possibility. Guided by ultrasound, the abortionist reaches into the uterus, grabs the unborn baby‚Äôs leg with forceps, and pulls the baby into the birth canal, except for the head, which is deliberately kept just inside the womb. (At this point in a partial-birth abortion, the baby is alive.) Then the abortionist jams scissors into the back of the baby‚Äôs skull and spreads the tips of the scissors apart to enlarge the wound. After removing the scissors, a suction catheter is inserted into the skull and the baby‚Äôs brains are sucked out. The collapsed head is then removed from the uterus. 26 Partial-birth abortion is a particularly gruesome procedure. Partial-birth abortion is now prohibited in the United States under federal law.
25 | Rick Scagnelli | 10153995750055950_10153996698035950 | Only CBS would report such nonsense....... I hope they get rid of those three morning monkeys they have after the election because they really have done a disservice to this country with their opinions every single morning

20 | Jessica Bell | 10153995690185950_10153995785950950 | Lets discuss Hillary's 30 years experience let's examine that experience! While Bill was president she publicly supported the crime bill that solidified systematic racism and did so by using the racist terms "super predators" and "bring them to heel"! She supported the Iraq war and military action in Libya and Syria! She publicly supported NAFTA which was a disaster for the American workers and people, then she helped draft the TPP which she publicly supported (till she figured out that pretending to be against it would get her votes)! She publicly supported DOMA (the defense of marriage act) by publicly stating on many occasions "marrige is a sacred bond between one man and one woman" (then decieded to "change her mind" and "evolve on the subject" to get votes)!She continued her racist legacy with the term "a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear"! She put classified information at risk and continously lied about it with her personal server! She tried to make her experience look impressive by lying and saying "I remember landing under sniper fire"! At each turn she either lies or blames someone else and when those don't work she says "that was a mistake"! I'm not exactly all that crazy about hearing "oopsie I destroyed the country" if you consider this as the experience you want for the president of the United States then I worry about your judgment! I can do without all this experience I will vote Jill Stein!

The last presidential candidate to not release his tax returns was Gerald Ford, in 1976. More fact-checking from tonight's debate:
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Nicole Blasi Field | 10153995529790950_10153995537375950 | And fact check- she's the only one running for president who couldn't pass a criminal background check.
2 | Nicole Blasi Field | 10153995529790950_10153995535370950 | Fact check on emails? Bengazhi?  Ohh the basis media.
3 | Kim Hargrove Adams | 10153995529790950_10153995617370950 | I just want to say that after watching them for years, I have lost all respect for CBS News. They have don't nothing but turn this presidential campaign into a Trash Trump Campaign. I haven't watched the debates, but the way CBS is putting it out there you would think Hillary Clinton is flawless!!! They have absolutely nothing bad to say about her and yet they have picked up on every little thing that Trump may have said that may have been meant toward something that may been...... Get real!!
4 | Kyle J. Heuerman | 10153995529790950_10153995574990950 | You could have a hay day fact checking the liar Hillary. But wait your network is clearly bias. HILLARY should be in prison. PERIOD!!!!!!
5 | Anna Larson | 10153995529790950_10153995550230950 | The questions you are asking right now to the focus group on the debate is unfair and unbiased they are all Democrats. This is nothing but dictatorship to American citizens.
6 | Sher Stahl | 10153995529790950_10153995583660950 | It is legal to make millions and not pay taxes. It's called write offs. Business owners, entrepreneurs, farmers, automotive industries and dealerships do it...money used to grow your business, or money donated to legal non-profit organizations, etc., it is 100% legal and helps us grow. If she doesn't like it, she should have fought to change it. Of course that will cost her supporters millions, so that will never happen. Instead, she will go after the middle class to create an even wider divide. CBS- why do you point out the fact that Donald did not agree to support her should he lose the election? Did you miss the part where she never agreed either? It sure would be nice to have a news source that reports facts instead of one-sided bs. I feel for those who rely on the media to make their decisions. More importantly, I feel for the rest of us who have to live with those decisions.
7 | Jim Moon | 10153995529790950_10153995715290950 | I honestly used to love cbs news. Now I only see you as one among so many other corrupt news agencies. Try telling the truth rather than the opinion of your president. You are reporters. Act like it,
8 | Jay Duch | 10153995529790950_10153995566610950 | Forget who did whatever in the past or who you are rooting for. I just don't think were unified as a country if the presidential candidates can't even shake each other's hand. What doe's that show to kids who should learn respect and manners no matter what. Plus you should always congratulate the winner. If our future President can't show respect to one another then I don't know what to say when people say this generation  has lost respect! these candidates are much older and I didn't see respect for one another from the beginning to the end. It's not hard to shake a persons hand to show good gesture.
9 | Floresa Williams | 10153995529790950_10153995643765950 | Ford was appointed not elected. And it WAS 40 years ago that he was a candidate; he lost the election to Jimmy Carter in 1976. You have to fact check the fact checkers now a days. LOL
10 | KevinKelly GladysSmith | 10153995529790950_10153995657995950 | While others fact check, Trump Fat checks.....just a few weeks ago up all not tweeting that Miss Universe is Fat, as if that is an issue facing poor and middle income America.  Keep on Fat checking Mr Trump, we don't care who is a 4 or a 6 or a 10 or which woman you say is a fat pig. We are concerned about real issues.  While CBS fact checks, Trump Fat checks.
11 | Ronnie Miller | 10153995529790950_10153995655925950 | Most shocking statement of the third debate: National debt is 70% of GDP. The only way to bring that down is by growing the gross domestic product(GDP). When Regan was president it was 4%. GDP is the monetary value of all the finished goods and services created in the United States. Without jobs our nation is doomed and I'm not a gloom and doomer. I've only been alarmed once before when I read the book "Conquer the Crash" in early 2000s. He said the banks would collapse and they did.We need to stop exporting jobs out of the country. I use to support all free trade treaties. I was wrong. I Love cheep stuff from China and Mexico but it it's sort of like fast food. Taste great but it clogs the arteries. GDP is the heart of the United States.
12 | Robin Trent Anderson | 10153995529790950_10153995587380950 | Again just another easy way out for Killary not answering for her lies!!!  It was so easy for her to get by without answering the question about Bill's treatment of women too!!!
13 | Ben Swinson | 10153995529790950_10153995554480950 | Obama is the first President in history to not have one year with GDP averaging 3% and that's after Trillions printed .. Fact ..

It takes roughly 4 minutes to launch a nuclear attack once the button is pushed?? Seriously?!?! She can't keep classified information and people want her as POTUS? Wow!
15 | Don Poyas | 10153995529790950_10153995665370950 | Chris Wallace didn't ask about ObamaCare, law and order, the inner cities, school vouchers, FBI quid pro quo, sanctuary cities, Benghazi. Stop dithering over whether Trump wants to support Clinton. Al Gore sued when he lost! Trump wins our vote.

22 | Jamie Mc | 10153995529790950_10153995627075950 | Does anyone seriously think that a business man will win in a debate against a career politician, lawyer, and debater? Trump held his own just fine.....
