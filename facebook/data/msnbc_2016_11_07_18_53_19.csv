1 | Edgar Pretelli | 10 | 10153847116351916_10153847337956916 | I believe that Hillary Clinton was born to make history in our times;  she was First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State and now..........she........will be..............President of the United States of America. It is her destiny. I hope every american will work together base on one meaning which is the meaning of being a human being.
2 | Mallory Miles | 2 | 10153847116351916_10153847350731916 | Omg guys. Come on! Look what this election has done to America! Are we not allowed to have differences in opinion anymore? Can we NOT support our candidate without insulting everyone who favors their opponent? This name calling and BS is the reason the whole world is laughing at us. Let's be mature.

When she was working on Watergate, why did her boss Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, call Hillary a ‚Äúliar‚Äù and ‚Äúan unethical, dishonest lawyer‚Äù and have her fired?6.

Why do you lie even about things that mean nothing: lying about being under sniper fire in Bosnia, lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, or lying that your grandparents were immigrants.15.

Thus, Ms. Clinton, are you incompetent or just a congenital liar?Everyone should go on you tube and watch The Clinton Chronicles -- it will amaze you what a couple of psychopaths the Clintons really are!10 QUESTIONS(1). "When you left the White House after your husband‚Äôs last term as president, why did you steal $200,000.00 worth of furniture, china, and artwork? And why did you tell the public that you ‚Äòreturned it‚Äô when you only brought back $27,000 of it?(2). Mrs. Clinton, when you were Secretary of State, why did you solicit contributions from foreign governments, (muslim princes donated multi-millions and got favors in return) for the Clinton Foundation after you promised President Obama you would not?(3). Mrs. Clinton, why do you and your husband claim to contribute millions of dollars to charity for a tax write off when it goes directly into your Clinton Foundation which only gives out 10% of the funds to charitable purposes and you pocket the balance to support yourself tax free? What does your daughter Chelsea do there for her 3 million dollar yearly salary?(4). Mrs. Clinton, why are you unable to account for 6 billion dollars of State department funds that seem to have disappeared while you were Secretary of State?(5). Mrs. Clinton why did you say you were broke when you left the White House, but purchased a 5 million home, built an addition for the secret service, and charge the tax payers of the United States $15,000.00 a month for their rent, an amount that pays your the entire mortgage?(6). Mrs. Clinton why did you lie to the American people about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, but managed to tell the truth to your daughter that same night it happened?(7). Mrs Clinton were you and your husband disbarred from practicing law? Answer: In 1996, Landmark Legal Foundation filed a complaint asking the court to disbar Hillary Clinton for violating the Arkansas code of conduct, (which requires lawyers to act with honesty and integrity) for her actions in the Whitewater scandal cover up. Hillary‚Äôs law license was suspended in 2002 for failing to complete her continuing legal education requirements. Bill Clinton was convicted by a grand jury for perjury and obstruction of justice to which he was impeached by the House of Representatives and disbarred from practicing as an attorney. He has been accused by a dozens of women for rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. He settled out of court for $850.000 in one case. Hillary has him out on her campaign trail championing for her theme of feminism and "women's rights". What a blasphemy. Neither one has enough integrity to hold onto a law license.(8). Mrs Clinton, why did you say, ‚ÄúI do not recall,‚Äù ‚ÄúI have no recollection,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù 56 times while testifying under oath during the Starr investigations.‚Ä¢(9). Mrs Clinton, what Really happened to Ron Brown when he was about to testify against you and your husband?(10). Mrs. Clinton what really happened to law partner Vince Foster? No way he committed suicide.CNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, I know that the answers to any of these questions don‚Äôt matter to you, you would support her regardless of whether she was guilty of murder, embezzlement, money laundering, and I could go on and on. The Democrat‚Äôs and liberal‚Äôs motto is, ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT CONFUSE ME WITH THE FACTS ‚Äì MY MIND IS MADE UP.

That's got to be a fraudulent activity given the FBI has concluded and made public no criminal activity every occurred.
5 | Steph Judice | 0 | 10153847116351916_10153847357631916 | DO NOT LISTEN TO THE POLLS !! If hillary were so far ahead, why would she be frantically going to all of the states that she allegedly has locked in. Look at the Trump rallys. They are not just getting a few thousand, they are getting thousands and thousands, people standing in line for hours to see him, mile long lines of people trying to get into Trump rallys. The polls are being used to deceive you... Like Rush said, If you do not trust the news media for your news, why would you trust their polls... GO VOTE!
6 | Terri Arana | 0 | 10153847116351916_10153847356761916 | Hillary always stole from the poor, how disgusting she is paying for her daughter's wedding out of the Clinton charity funds .
7 | Michael Rios | 0 | 10153847116351916_10153847355276916 | Voter Suppression can not be ignored. Unlike guns they are coming after your right to vote. The effort to keep people of color from voting and lessening the effect of what their vote counts for is undeniable. They are making it increasingly more difficult for them to vote for a reason. They gerrymander their neighborhoods in such ridiculous ways so their representation is lessened. It's nothing less than an effort to silence people of color. It's time to make Republicans pay for it. They've selected a nominee that will badmouth them one second and claim he's their biggest fan the next. It's time to make Republicans read that autopsy report.
8 | Ken Myers | 0 | 10153847116351916_10153847355161916 | For 25 years she has been attacked in a coordinated effort to stop the first woman President. The Republicans knew the day she brought healthcare to the congress that she was that good. 25 years of endless attacks and tomorrow we find out if challenging the powerful and making them sweat, will cost her the White House. She learned that you can not beat them with good will alone, you have to have resources. She learned that any thing you say or do can be an investigation if they want one. 6 investigations and all ended the same. No guilt. The only thing she was ever guilty of was challenging male dominated power and their billion dollar lobbyists, in the case of healthcare. The insurance companies and Republicans swore they would make sure she regretted making them look bad in the early 90's. They have made it painful, but she will never regret walking out on that limb for the people. Tomorrow we will find out if a little girl in the big city or the sparse rural area can look to the future and say "YES WE CAN".
9 | Nick Hughes | 1 | 10153847116351916_10153847346411916 | Or how msnbc and CNN along with ABC CBS and all the other corrupt main stream media was busted for working with the corrupt Clinton's campaign to corrupt and rig the election against Bernie and trump
10 | Joseph Matthews | 1 | 10153847116351916_10153847346561916 | This is an appeal to independent, Democratic and Republican Christians: Vote Republican if you want unfettered access to worship Jesus as you please. Last year, a Democratic mayor in Houston sought to force conservative pastors to submit copies of their sermons to her office. Only after a public outcry did she pull back on her demand. Two weeks ago, an African-American pastor was fired from his job as head of a public health district after he refused to provide copies of his sermons (I'm guessing they wanted to peruse his views on gay marriage and abortion) to his employers. This is only the beginning folks and it is by far the most important issue of this election. They're about to come after Jesus, led by groups like the ACLU, and try to intimidate Bible-believing Christians, especially conservative Christians in an effort to shut them up and drive them from public discourse. They will seek to have anything they disagree with labeled as hate speech so pastors and others can face prosecution and fines and jail time and it's important to allow Mr. Trump to appoint constitutional Supreme Court justices who will not allow this type of Biblical assault to occur. Hillary will appoint judges across the nation who will back these efforts.

At all?4) She is so out of touch she hasn‚Äôt driven a car since 1996.5) When she was practicing law, Hillary Clinton defended a man who raped a 12 year old girl. She tore the little girl apart on the stand, got the rapist off with a light sentence and later laughed about it with a reporter.6) She claimed multiple times that she had to run for her life because her plane landed under SNIPER FIRE in Bosnia. Actually, when she landed there was a greeting ceremony and an 8 year old girl read her a poem.7) She hasn‚Äôt accomplished anything that shows she‚Äôs qualified to be President. 8) Hillary Clinton helped create the Iranian nuclear deal that is allowing a terrorist-supporting, anti-American nation to get nuclear weapons.9) She is planning to expand on Obama‚Äôs unconstitutional waving of immigration law for young illegal immigrants.10) Her judgment on foreign policy is terrible. Not only did she get people killed in Benghazi, she supported our intervention in Syria.

Vermont, Wyoming, Oregon, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Iowa, Delaware, and Alabama, write in Bernie too. Everybody else, your job is to vote third party so we can be rid of Trump/Clinton and kick this thing to the US House. The goal, keep Trump and Clinton out of the top three.

8 | Faith Paulele | 5 | 1345101365586112_1345104492252466 | #MediaMirror Go ahead just look at yourselves; for over 500 days trying to be a star. All analysis; of extreme, jaw-dropping reality. "I don't know Joe, what do you think?" "DUH!" "I don't know Chuck what do you think?" "Sensational!" "Astonishing!" and the ratings kept rising. You completely forgot you are the News, not a Reality Show. It is not about you, it is about the voter. And how well you (Our #NEWS) are exploring the truths and explaining to #US the honest choices.So what do you do, as you got sucked up in the Trump Vacuum, cause he made you do it, like he made everyone else do it. (Analyze that!) The first thing you do is call him #Trump and her #Hillary. This is not equal, but you made it so. Then you payed all his media bills as you and America waited on the edge of their seats for the next shoe to fall and would lightning #finally strike?You forgot, normally it is the GOP who takes the moral high ground and calls everyone down on the carpet and shames and investigates until they get their OilWhiteMale way. Well this year you forgot, #We ARE the people. With the old guard going down the toilet trying to figure out how to save themselves. There was no lightning to be thrown down. Only a very smart woman; who knew better then to open her mouth, get emotional, be critical, call you dumbbells out.There is so much I want to say, so much that went wrong. But I know how short your attention span is and I do not want to lose you, so I will get right to the Knockout Punch. #Politics is #not a sport, or a game. It is a very difficult learning experience which takes a lifetime sometimes. Your worst mistake this year, and it is a simple example of a HUGE problem, is you Assumed, being the elites that YOU are, that all of America knew, what the #Word misogyny means.
9 | David Colman | 6 | 1345101365586112_1345111038918478 | If George and Arizona are battleground states and Clinton wins North Carolina, she will win every single one of these "likely" blue states, guaranteeing her 289 electoral votes even if she loses all the other yellow states. Trump is trying to pick off Michigan, and Pennsylvania, but those states have an unbelievably more favorable electorate then North Carolina and Florida (which she is up in) and Trump is still focused on appealing to the fringe instead of reaching out to the moderates as candidates usually do at this point.

Bill Clinton was convicted by a grand jury for perjury and obstruction of justice to which he was impeached by the House of Representatives and disbarred from practicing as an attorney. He has been accused by a dozens of women for rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. He settled out of court for $850.000 in one case. Hillary has him out on her campaign trail championing for her theme of feminism and "women's rights". What a blasphemy. Neither one has enough integrity to hold onto a law license.(8). Mrs Clinton, why did you say, ‚ÄúI do not recall,‚Äù ‚ÄúI have no recollection,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù 56 times while testifying under oath during the Starr investigations.‚Ä¢(9). Mrs Clinton, what Really happened to Ron Brown when he was about to testify against you and your husband?(10). Mrs. Clinton what really happened to law partner Vince Foster? No way he committed suicide.CNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, I know that the answers to any of these questions don‚Äôt matter to you, you would support her regardless of whether she was guilty of murder, embezzlement, money laundering, and I could go on and on. The Democrat‚Äôs and liberal‚Äôs motto is, ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT CONFUSE ME WITH THE FACTS ‚Äì MY MIND IS MADE UP.
12 | Cherylyn McCollam-Kerley | 2 | 1345101365586112_1345128712250044 | Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were walking down the street when they came to a homeless person. Trump gave the homeless person his business card and told him to come to his office for a job. He then took $20 out of his pocket and gave it to the homeless person. Hillary was very impressed, so when they came to another homeless person, she decided to help. She walked over to the homeless person and gave him directions to the welfare office. She then reached into Trump‚Äôs pocket and got out $20. She kept $15 for her administrative fees and gave the homeless person $5.00. Now, do you understand the difference between a Conservative and a Liberal progressive?

We have the RIGHT & RESPONSIBILITY to impeach any official of the executive or judicial branch of our government. We need to start a petition calling for the impeachment of any government official recieving funds from ANY major corporations. Then we need to make it illegal for any future political officials to accept any kind of money from anyone accept their paycheck. If they do they should immediately impeached with no severance pay. It should be illegal to engage in any form of bullying during campaigning. The issues of the country and world need to be discussed, not swept under a rug while the candidates spend an hour calling each other names. There should be term limits with equal amounts of officials from each political party in the country being represented. There needs to be laws for more transparency in the government. We the people have the RIGHT to know what our government is doing!!!To our military and police, when the revolution begins you need to lay down your weapons and join us! It is your responsibility as an American citizen to fight corruption and injustice. Do your duty.
14 | Stephen Suba | 1 | 1345101365586112_1345116615584587 | Lots of enthusiasm here...only 1000 likes for this post...Hillary can have these 1000 votes. Trumps drawing record crowds 6 million just watched it last night online. By the way wiki leaks just dumped 23035 of Hillarys marked confidential emails. Which FBI lied were only few. 23000 is lots of few. Now wiki leaks posted it for the whole world to see how corrupt our government is.
15 | David Colman | 0 | 1345101365586112_1345117938917788 | President Obama won the African-American vote by 98 points in 2012, and Clinton is winning it by 70 points in some of the key battleground states. With President Obama and Michelle Obama's tireless campaigning for Clinton, I don't see Trump breaking 10 points with African Americans in North Carolina. Trump's new attack on Native Americans could be a factor in flipping Arizona which will also probably have the highest Latino turnout in the country as Latino's in Maricopa County lined up around the block in the early voting to vote out their racist Sheriff, and the Sheriff is going to lose by 20 points and take Trump down with him.
16 | David Colman | 0 | 1345101365586112_1345121052250810 | Clinton is right now up 4 points from where Obama was at in North Carolina in 2012, and 8 points from where Obama was at in Arizona in 2012, both states Obama lost. If Clinton has high Latino turnout in Florida, and high African-American turnout in North Carolina this all makes up for the fact that Trump is doing better than Romney in these rustbelt states
17 | Eddie Conroy | 0 | 1345101365586112_1345130978916484 | Hillary can only Win if she can steal it with the help of the Media. She can't even fill a middle school auditorium on her own. Trump has a fired up base 20,000-30,000 a Rally , 4 a day

21 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 2 | 1345101365586112_1345104528919129 | so tell us what is good about Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency which will ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù weaken the country, his tax cuts would add 9.5 Trillion to the debt,  driving the U.S. into a ‚Äúlengthy recession‚Äù with nearly 3.5 million job losses and a 7 percent unemployment rate, according to a Moody‚Äôs Analytics analysis.The tax code under Mr. Trump‚Äôs plan will be much less progressive than the current tax code. More than one-third of the proposed tax cuts on personal income will go to the top 1% of income earners, with the average taxpayer in this group receiving a reduction in their tax bill of $275,000. Taxpayers in the bottom 99% of income earners will receive a tax cut of less than $2,500.Under Trump's plan, the conservative Tax Foundation expects that the bottom 80 percent of Americans will see just 0.8 percent to 1.8 percent more income after his tax cuts. Clinton's plan will only increase taxes for America's wealthiest earners.The large increase in tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports supported by Mr. Trump further exacerbates inflation pressures. The U.S. imports nearly $500 billion in goods a year from China, and another almost $300 billion from Mexico, accounting for approximately 35% of total U.S. non-petroleum goods imports. Outside of Canada, no other country comes close as a source of imports. Slapping a 45% tariff on Chinese imports and 35% on non-petroleum Mexican imports thus increases overall goods import prices by approximately 15%.would most likely retaliate with in-kind tariffs on U.S. imports. This would be a big hit to U.S. exports, as we ship well over $100 billion in products a year to China, and almost $250 billion to Mexico.And the problem with trumps outspoken approach to Mexican immigration, his ‚Äúplan‚Äù to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants would shrink the economy by about 2 percent, according to American Action Forum (AAF), a conservative and pro-business think tank. The sudden subtraction of 7 million workers would cause an immediate shock to thousands of businesses, triggering a GDP collapse ranging from $400 billion to $600 billion in productionNot to overlook Donald Trump who casts himself as a protector of workers and jobs, but a USA TODAY NETWORK investigation found hundreds of people ‚Äì carpenters, dishwashers, painters, even his own lawyers ‚Äì who say he didn‚Äôt pay them for their work. And uses undocumented labor along with Chinese Steel over American for his hotels and resorts !

1 | Kathie Routman Dior | 29 | 1561086363911388_1561107883909236 | HARD CORE DEMOCRATS don't care that Hillary Clinton flip flops her views as needed to get votes. They don't care that she has lied repeatedly for years. They don't care that she helped create a health care system that is about to fail, leaving millions by the wayside. They don't care that she was instrumental in the very creation of a morphed Al Qaeda, now called ISIS. They don't care that millions of people have either died or have been displaced by her instrumentation of such. They don't care that her Clinton Foundation has taken hundreds of millions of dollars from countries that kill gays and stone women. They don't care that she has committed treasonous acts via her foundation by doing favors for enemy nations. They don't care that she and her husband have created an enterprise whereby all the mainstream media, including the New York Times, CNN, NBC, ABC, Comcast, can donate. They don't care that she has been so incredibly successful at wielding money and power from the world's largest companies, here and abroad, that she rules over the entire Obama administration, including President Obama, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and FBI director James Comey. They don't care that she believes killing a baby hours before its natural birth trumps a mother's choice to have the baby slaughtered. They don't care that she has never done anything to improve the plight of Blacks or Hispanics who may be caught in a inter-generational web of dependency, poverty, and unemployment. They don't care that she has done nothing about the bad schools, drugs, and crime in the ghetto. They don't care that she is indifferent to the millions of immigrants who come to our shores legally, and spend large amounts of time and money in order to become U.S. citizens, while others cut in line. They don't care that she has done nothing to stop drugs from infiltrating our towns and cities. They don't care that she blatantly cheated by being given primary debate questions in advance. They don't care to think about why her answers during the debates seemed so well rehearsed, almost memorized. They don't care that her organization worked to plant violent operatives in Trump rallies. They don't care about how women were paid off to claim harassment by Trump. You know what? The problem is not that hard core democrats don't care that Hillary Clinton is a liar, a cheat, and a thief. The problem is that they are willing to support a morally bankrupt candidate.

4 | Randy Sparling | 2 | 1561086363911388_1561121370574554 | The economic stagnancy of the Obama years is to blame for plummeting life expectancy rates among white, working-class Americans, according to former president Bill Clinton, who privately told Democratic donors that lower-income whites ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning.‚ÄùClinton made the remarks while speaking to at a November 2015 closed-door fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in Canton, Ohio.

It is her destiny. I hope every american will work together base on one meaning which is the meaning of being a human being.
6 | Patrick Kerr | 2 | 1561086363911388_1561104030576288 | I think GOP will be much stronger in 4 years.  They hit rock bottom with Trump, but they will find a much better candidate and come back strong in the next election.

9 | Clarence Holmes | 0 | 1561086363911388_1561133107240047 | Given Trump‚Äôs stoking of racial animus and GOP state legislatures‚Äô gerrymandering and blatant attempts at suppressing minority voting, we cannot say it is unnecessary in 2016 to protect voting rights in America. Media and Congressional Democrats must encourage public debate of the changes SCOTUS made to the Voting Rights Act in 2013. Suppressing people‚Äôs right to vote is a perversion of American democracy.
10 | Mark Hiser | 1 | 1561086363911388_1561110970575594 | I watched every primary and general election debate this election cycle, viewed most of the televised speeches, read across the political spectrum about the candidates (during both the primary and general election phase of the campaigns). I actively sought views and opinions opposed to my own. Long ago, I was certain Trump has almost nothing positive to offer the presidency, this country or the world. With Hillary, though, I sometimes struggle. I voted for her, but not with enthusiasm.  In fact, most of my decisions were focused on stopping Trump rather than electing Hillary.I cannot deny that she is determined, persistent, experienced, intelligent, hard-working, and thoughtful.  I cannot deny that she is strong yet able to listen to others.   I cannot deny that I disagree with her on some matters of policy and I wonder if she is too close to Wall Street.  But, when I am honest with myself, I must wonder of some of my lack of enthusiasm for her is due to my own ingrained sexism.  This country has not/ does not treat women as equals to men.  Women still make less money for the same jobs, face glass ceilings, carry much, if not most, of the burden of raising children and taking care of domestic matters.  Women still face men objectifying them.  And, when we do see a strong, woman who fights and refuses to be silent and ‚Äúpretty,‚Äù we often think they are lesbians (see all the tabloid articles about Hillary being a lesbian), and almost certainly think they should‚Äù act more feminine.‚Äù In short, we dismiss them or, at least, look down on them and find something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù about who they are.In fact, compare Hillary and Melania Trump:Here is a list of Melanis‚Äôa major accomplishments:--former model who worked for fashion houses in Europe before coming to the US--married rich man who is almost twice her age; started dating Trump while he was still married (though separated) from his second wife--went to college for one year before dropping out--model who appeared on the cover of several fashion magazines--posed in the nude for a fashion shoot for British GQ magazine--gave a few speeches during her husband‚Äôs campaign, though at least one of the speeches was heavily plagiarizedHere is a list of a few of Hillary‚Äôs accomplishments:--First student commencement speaker at Wellesley College--graduate of Yale Law School--former Director of the Arkansas Legal Aid Clinic--former civil litigation attorney--former law professor at University of Arkansas School of Law--elected Senator of New York, twice--former candidate for the presidency--US Secretary of State --author--played lead role in the creation of the State Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program--played major role in the creation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act and the Foster Care Independence Act--was instrumental in increasing funding to the NIH for prostate cancer and asthma research--was instrumental in investigating mental illnesses resulting from the Gulf War--helped create the Office of Violence Against Women at the Justice Department--instrumental in gaining over 21 billion in World Trade Center redevelopment fundsAnd there are more.Granted, Melania Trump is not running for President, but still there seems to be little hatred for her.  When Hillary was First Lady of the US, there was already lots of hatred.  Today that hatred continues.  Not all that Hillary does works out.  She has made mistakes and has done some ‚Äúbad things,‚Äù as have all human beings.  She is not perfect as I am not perfect.  I do not always agree with what she does, but I still must wonder how much of my feelings about her come from the sexism that is so ingrained in our culture, sexism that makes men and women secretly fear and resent women who are powerful and who refuse to be held behind or put in a box.  When  I look at the above list, I suspect sexism does play a major factor in my feelings about her, and that saddens me.
11 | Jeff Brewer | 0 | 1561086363911388_1561145797238778 | This comment is NOT in response to this video. It is directed to all those that work at MSNBC ... First, I have pretty much always aligned myself with the (D) party ... Gave up years ago, like so many others in this country have. I know the media can be very biased and slant, or even blatantly lie to promote someone's agenda .... So, I would like to thank all at MSNBC, and especially the tall good looking blonde that vehemently attacked Trump when he mocked HRC by telling the Russians if they had the 33,000 emails, give them to the press, they'll reward you for it .... Now first, if the Russians did give you the 33,000 emails, how happy would you be... But, you knew they couldn't, they didn't have them .... So, because of this vehement attack  against a candidate that I had no concern about I knew who was the LIAR ... You MSNBC vehemently LIED to me... Therefore, Trump must be against the Snake you are working for... I thank you for showing me which candidate is working for the Snake ... This is a movement ....  We Americans are coming to ... "Drain the Swamp".

14 | David Colman | 0 | 1561086363911388_1561199700566721 | I have been to a Donald Trump rally. Half of his supporters are in this "basket of deplorables." He has given a huge platform to voters with these same viewpoints Clinton characterizes those in this basket of having.
15 | Terry Wickwire | 4 | 1561086363911388_1561101613909863 | We can all learn how Donald J Dump was capable of taking the Republican Party by the force of his will. Republicans will need to do some deep soul searching to redefine their Party and reinvent themselves as representative of we the people and our lives. Republicans witnessed the horror of Sandy Hook and did nothing. Republicans witnessed mass shootings all over the nation, and politicized the proliferation of more weapons. The NRA has the Republican Party by the throat, and I use Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as my proof. He said that "any Supreme Court nominees should be approved by the NRA." We need to win the Senate and demote Mitch McConnell. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that Dump's comment "is the very definition of a racist comment." Paul Ryan supports Dump. The Republican Congress approval rating is in the toilet while President Obama has unprecedented approval ratings. Americans figured out who is responsible for the dysfunction in Washington DC and we will fix Congress. Vice Presidential candidate Tea Party Pence wants Americans to believe that Donald J Dump is capable of fixing the problems of the Tea Party obstructionists making. His history speaks volumes about his own bias against the LGBT and minority communities, and if he is the standard bearer for the future of the Republican Party then they will have learned nothing. Cuban Canadian Cruz isn't any better, Marco Rubio is a sellout, Chaffetz has more skeletons than a graveyard, Gowdy is complicit with the false accusations and conspiracy theories against Hillary Clinton, Republican Governors are hated by their constituents and the Republican Party is fractured and failing. The only good news for their Party are Republicans like Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse who put content of character ahead of Party. They have a tough road ahead.I can write a book about the history of Dump and his divisive campaign, and my Facebook timeline is a treasure trove of facts that define his character flaws and immoral behaviors. His litigious future is bleak and his brand is forever tarnished, he faces felony fraud trials, a RICO trial, 169 federal lawsuits and counting and thousands of other suits for his crooked business practices. He was hoping for Executive Privilege to erase his corrupt history. He failed. Americans are going to send a resounding message to Dump and anybody else who wants to use this division as a springboard to power. Women, minorities, educated and moral people will rebuke Dump and bemuse his supporters. You're all witnessing the day when Americans stood up against authoritarian isolationism and racial profiling on our soil. America is already great because of the goodness of most of our people. History will be so much kinder to President Obama than Republicans ever were. VOTE BLUE.

Rachel Maddow and Chris Matthews reflect on the latest development from FBI Director James Comey in finding no new material on Anthony Weiner's laptop after all and the impact of the FBI in these final days of the 2016 campaign.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Tara Gordon | 35 | 1345034562259459_1345079255588323 | How can any one have faith in them after this. The director should do the honorable thing and step down because he has tarnished the agency beyond repair if he stays. He needs to fall on the sword and step down.
2 | Jason Brantley | 67 | 1345034562259459_1345039738925608 | John F Kennedy must be rolling over in his grave right now. All of the work he did to advance the tolerance and socioeconomic stature of the Democratic Party is being thrown away by the Alt Left Movement. The influence of Saul Alinsky and Bill Ayers has totally corrupted JFK's work. The Democrats of today seek power at any cost. They are not social justice warriors looking out for the little guy. They are big government elites looking to subjugate the masses for their own financial gain.
3 | Timothy Reents | 14 | 1345034562259459_1345042508925331 | The worst kinds of "mean people". Trump Dream Team are deplorable people!!!"Trump traded up friend-to-dictators Paul Manafort for the dick-to-his-friends Steve Bannon, who apparently nurtured a rancid corporate culture of his own over at Breitbart News. More recently, Trump added Citizens United hatchet-man David Bossie to his camp as deputy campaign manager. They join ranks that include famed ‚Äúdirty trickster‚Äù Roger Stone, trench-mouthed adviser Carl Paladino, and the perpetually hanging on hanger-on Corey Lewandowski, whose relationship to the campaign ‚Äï maybe he‚Äôs in, maybe he‚Äôs not ‚Äï seems to depend on the wind direction. (Recent acquisition Kellyanne Conway is the seasoned professional who‚Äôs been tasked with extracting a functioning, professional campaign from this rogues‚Äô gallery ‚Äï that is, if she has any time left between all the occasions Ailes asks her to ‚Äúgive him a little twirl.‚Äù)" Quote from Jason Linkins.Follow the "books"....Brad Parscales: trumps digital marketer, supporter lists, and donations database administrator. Trump, as the law and order guy,   Trump will coalesce the "radical fringes" in America and Internationally for law enforcement's benefit. I pray!
4 | CeCe Writeher | 12 | 1345034562259459_1345043755591873 | Well, he broke the rules of protocol like no other director has ever done. He broke the rule, but it's not "illegal" as far as the GOP is concerned. So it "might have or could have" negatively hurt Clinton's chances, but they don't know and it shouldn't make a difference.  It's not like breaking protocol rules as Secretary of State like all other Secretaries of State, you know, like Clinton did using a private server that "might have or could have", but didn't cause any harm, but for her to do it, it was "illegal". The GOP has no motive, no agenda, no part in seeking an investigation into Comey breaking this FBI Director rule.  After all, he did what they asked of him, and now there's pictures of his Trump sign, in his yard. Case closed. Now, back to Hillary, and all she's hiding and what she did with having a private server, and  you know, this rigged election.
5 | Judith Croy | 6 | 1345034562259459_1345056468923935 | In 1993, my car was rear ended on Dorsey Drive, the road leading to the Golden Gate Bridge, by an intoxicated FBI supervisor who lived in Marin. My car had died, and I had my emergency flasher on, and I had gotten out of my car and had gone to the toll booth to report that my car was dead on Dorsey Drive. By the time I reported it, the person told me he knew, because it had been demolished and was hauled to a yard next to the toll booth. I looked at my car, and it was crunched all the way up to the drivers seat, and if I had been in it, I would have been killed. I was told the California Highway Patrol arrested Patrick Conway, for DUI, and took him in handcuffs because he was belligerent and told them they had no right to arrest him because he was high up in the FBI. The next day I went to the CHP office and asked to see the record of the incident, and who hit my car, as the law says I have a right to know, and my insurance company needs to know. They showed me his name and address and told me they would make a copy and I could pick it up later. When I returned, the name had been whited out, and just the Department of Justice scrawled in. My insurance paid me for my totaled Honda, but they were blocked from getting any money from the FBI. Two FBI agents came to my home to investigate what I knew about the incident. I told them what I knew, including the drunk supervisor who was responsible, who hit me with an FBI marked car, and was taken away in handcuffs. They threatened me if I ever told anyone about this. The FBI changed public records to avoid responsibility for the incident, and stonewalled my insurance company. So I have not had respect for them for years.
6 | Victor Colonna Jr | 3 | 1345034562259459_1345053632257552 | FBI Director Comey is an establishment puppet--every bit as political and corrupted as the establishment politicians. In the end, Hillary's email problem only ended up being a diversion to the real center of corruption--The Clinton Foundation.
7 | Marion Rohling | 7 | 1345034562259459_1345050255591223 | The FBI....another institution that is supposed to protect us from harm. Another pipe dream? So the racketeer, that they call their "candidate" is saying the election is rigged?
8 | Jose Luis Garcia | 1 | 1345034562259459_1345096615586587 | I think, and according to the internal investigations so far which show the FBI having a minute group of FBI agents rooting and helping the Trump Campaign, the Democrats should push for a Congressional Investigation, just like the Republicans did to try to oust and denigrate Hillary's carreer and Presidential Campaign, and see how they like to be involved in the same Cow droppings they created!!!
9 | Peter H Brouillard | 1 | 1345034562259459_1345053048924277 | If anyone thinks if their candidate gets in they will turn this around, you are blind. If either one gets in there, they face problems of biblical proportions. Rome could not be fixed in a day, let alone the first 100 days in office. We are going to be in the same spot or worse for the next 4 years. We can fix this problem on Tuesday and in the future. If you do not like her, just do not vote for Hillary. If you do not like him, do not vote for Trump. Vote for the other 2 candidates or write in Bernie Sanders. After the election, change your voting status to unaffiliated. You do not lose anything by being unaffiliated. Let me ask you a question, have you ever received money back from the Republicans or the Democrats? Parties are for celebrating or for people to get drunk and stupid. All they do is ask for money, use it for their own personal gain, and then forget about you for the next 4 years. In the mean time, you are out more money with no return on investment. Just over the last 2 days, I have received over 47 donation requests from both parties. Do not follow a party and make the politicians beg for your vote. There is a reason why a sitting President and all the money being spent is to keep business as usual. Would you want your money making machine taken away? The hardworking candidates will get out there and show you why they need your vote. Do not be the Democratic sheep we have had in my state for all these years and see no progress. They want you to be complacent. Take charge of your families future. Show them the power you have. Make the politicians that think making money off of us is not going to be easy and tell them we will hold them accountable to the promises they make. Let them know it will take hard work and dedication. Most of all, they will not be able to take advantage of the American People.

11 | William N Debi Thill | 4 | 1345034562259459_1345038265592422 | After watching Director Comey being grilled 4 1/2 hours by nearly All attorney's that just kept repeating, you know, if we were prosecuting this case.........I have come to believe, his felt pressure to revisit the investigation. By doing that, so close to election day, he was at least lending a hand with adding to awkward confusion. As he sat there confirming no Attorney would prosecute her, I felt he was steadfast in his belief.....but they may have gotten under his skin. IMO  anyways.
12 | Edgar Pretelli | 0 | 1345034562259459_1345130532249862 | I believe that Hillary Clinton was born to make history in our times;  she was First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State and now..........she........will be..............President of the United States of America. It is her destiny. I hope every american will work together base on one meaning which is the meaning of being a human being.
13 | Patrick Drazen | 0 | 1345034562259459_1345107492252166 | The same as what? I stopped believing in the FBI at Christmas 1972, when Nixon had L. Patrick Gray destroy Watergate evidence. My favorite comment on that was in the National Lampoon, and showed a speech balloon coming out of FBI headquarters: "This is L Patrick Grey of the FBI. I know I'm in there! If I don't come out with my hands up, I'm coming in after me!"
14 | Kris Ryder | 5 | 1345034562259459_1345046032258312 | Are there any other Republicans that are going to watch Rachel tomorrow night just to see the look on her smug, obnoxious face when she tells you Trump wins? Or if Hillary wins she can tell me how stupid, vile and ignorant I am. That should prepare me for the next four years. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
15 | Timothy Madeira | 3 | 1345034562259459_1345072118922370 | Why have all the FBI Directors been members of the Republican Party? Shouldn't this appointment be non-partisan? Maybe it's time to change this. Kathleen
16 | Maggie Ann McNutt Patterson | 1 | 1345034562259459_1345089585587290 | The frenzy and furor over Hillary Clinton‚Äôs email habits while at the State Department, now into their 16th month and still going strong, have predictably and effectively chipped away at her reputation, so a sizable majority of Americans (67 percent in a poll last month) find her ‚Äúuntrustworthy.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs what a year of FBI investigation‚Äîleading to no recommended charges‚Äîa budding congressional investigation and a relentless right-wing watchdog‚Äôs lawsuit buy you in American politics.But take a moment away from pawing through the tens of thousands of her personal and professional emails now on public view and consider the long list of elected and appointed Republicans who have done exactly the same thing as Clinton‚Äîand worse.Between 2003 and 2005, the George W. Bush White House ‚Äúlost‚Äù around 5 million emails, including messages related to the firing of federal prosecutors who didn't adhere to Bush‚Äôs conservative agenda. A federal judge ruled that the White House didn‚Äôt have to look for them.Those emails were among some 22 million messages that the Bush administration ‚Äúlost‚Äù during its time in power, most from right around the period that it was crafting a scaffolding of lies to sell what turned out to be the greatest American foreign policy debacle in a generation: the Iraq War. The emails were eventually found in 2009, when Bush and Dick Cheney were safely back at their ranches, but long after thousands of young Americans were dead and maimed and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were dead, and as Islamists were mustering to eventually capture swathes of lawless, war-ravaged turf for their hideous ‚ÄúcaliphateHundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars have been wasted on a virtual witch hunt for political purposes alone. Our republican congress has engaged in fraud, waste and abuse of the taxpayers trust. Yet, even after this investigation and near 30 years worth of attempts to crucify this woman no evidence of any criminal wrong doing has ever been found. This all has been a pure attempt to sabotage her political career. Give it a rest and quit wasting taxpayer dollars.
17 | John McCarthy | 1 | 1345034562259459_1345041978925384 | im Meador Hillary brokered the deal through Steve ns and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Steve ns was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in‚Ä¶because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers. Send this again and again and again until everyone reads this truth. Our nation depends on people getting the TRUTH, instead of the pack of lies being fed to us by Corrupt Obama and Clinton and the Corrupt News Media
18 | Diane Bane | 0 | 1345034562259459_1345078455588403 | No it won't be! There should be consequences for what Comey did. He blatantly tried to effect the out come of this election.  I used to think he was a fair and  respectable man. Disappointed!
19 | Richard T. Ayers | 0 | 1345034562259459_1345066782256237 | Well, there's some NEW...potential fall-outs that may come from this FBI investigation, of Anthony Weiner's laptop. Now, that we know: that there are FBI agents, who are ready to crawl around, down in the mud....with their reputations and the agency's integrity, for a FLIM-FLAM man, like Donald Trump. By a show of hands, or bodies falling to the floors of your homes, in shock and laughter, how many of you would fall out of your chair (or Lazy-Boy), if it hits the airwaves.....about 6-months down the road, that several FBI Agents were exposed to have stolen some of the names, addresses, and contact information of some of Anthony Weiner's Sexting contacts. And, these agents were found to have been contacting, sexting, and engaging in internet sex parties, with these same women (and Lord knows, Children) themselves. And then, as these agents are being "Perp-walked" out of a Federal office, across the region....Director Jim Comey will be found, sitting on the ledge of the Federal building, in DC, contemplating what to do...with his life.
20 | Daniel Cook LaQuinta Calif | 0 | 1345034562259459_1345070408922541 | what a corrupt FBI director and his side kick Loretta Lynch AG they do not even try to hide their illegal activities, when Trump is President he should prosecute and deny them any future positions resulting in law matters......hell they prosecuted Martha Steward for insider trading

22 | Annette Ayala | 7 | 1345034562259459_1345037542259161 | EVER! I still say Trump had something real juicy on Comey.  He would never risk his career like this.  So now I guess we'll focus on getting the lying rapist off right! #DUMPTHELYINGRAPIST!
23 | Jim Williams | 4 | 1345034562259459_1345042268925355 | As Campaign Manager Kelleyanne Conway so enthusiastically put it, "the damage has been done", thanks to the Breitbart cabal at the FBI, Putin and his teen hackers in Macedonia. Certain members of the media have some 'splainin' to do.

"I got your 'blue state' right here," Ted Nugent tells a Michigan crowd before grabbing his crotch at a rally supporting Donald J. Trump.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Nick Moretti | 2009 | 1344975568932025_1344983655597883 | Yes, an embarrassment to the great state of Michigan. The draft-dodging racist animal killer himself. What a piece of garbage.
2 | Brian Daley | 1375 | 1344975568932025_1344983555597893 | Nugent is one of the most disgusting, insane piece of sh*ts alive. He is the king of deplorable trash. Wait, Trump is the King... so Nugent is just a court jester I guess.
3 | Teresa Hale Edwards | 458 | 1344975568932025_1344987282264187 | These are the same people saying that they were offended by Beyonc√©?!  He made a good point, though,  about not being able to vote for criminals and scam artists...that definitely leaves Trump out ü§î.
4 | Christopher H Eagan | 474 | 1344975568932025_1344991125597136 | Congratulations on your nominee Evangelical Christian Republicans. Oh, and I see he brought his friend Mr. Nugent along as well. That's family values right there.
5 | Sylvia Queen | 356 | 1344975568932025_1344989028930679 | Trump does not need "celebrity" support? So instead he gets support from one of the most repulsive slugs on the planet.
6 | Liz Lowell | 176 | 1344975568932025_1344985358931046 | Trump was right in that he didn't need stars to help him at his rallys...he got the biggest has been he could find in Nugent...
7 | Shannon Demny | 185 | 1344975568932025_1344988272264088 | The joke is on Trump supporters who think he is going to carry the torch for the Republican party. He's not one of them and is a true scam artist.
8 | Amy Herrmann | 122 | 1344975568932025_1344992308930351 | Ted Nugent. Where does one even start? What kind of person cares what this man says? He's the perfect surrogate for Trump. Violent, angry, and deplorable.
9 | Blair D. Scott Sr. | 96 | 1344975568932025_1344989655597283 | Rofl, Lmbo, LOl..And Hillary Clinton approve of the message. Does Trump people realize what they're saying, everything he just said was about Trump. These people have lost their minds, that "Orange Fool Aid", is very dangerous, and toxic. Jim Jones did the same thing in November 1978 and look what happen to those people. \
10 | Carolyn Clarke | 99 | 1344975568932025_1344993315596917 | Ted Nugent, you need to crawl back into your cave. You are a pathetic moron, and clearly have never progressed beyond your neanderthal stages of development.
11 | Vennessa Baccus | 47 | 1344975568932025_1344994058930176 | Did he just say you can't vote for liars and scam artists when trump lies about everything and con everyone ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
12 | Karen Isaacson | 37 | 1344975568932025_1814434758814719 | What does that have to say for the republican party, the RNC, Donald Trump and his smiley face Kellyanne Conway by having this DEPLORABLE man out campaigning for Trump?  What were they thinking?  Now, go out and vote blue down the line!
13 | Kevin Kelly | 42 | 1344975568932025_1344988715597377 | I thought this racist loser said he was going to be dead or in jail within a year if Obama was reelected?
14 | Marsha Boutelle | 31 | 1344975568932025_1344995788930003 | Not surprising that a psycho like Ted Nugent would think a sociopath like Trump is fit to lead the greatest power in the world.
15 | Deborah Renee | 33 | 1344975568932025_1344988445597404 | Trump supporters like that mess...they vote for that kind of filth and ill-mannered behavior. I'm sticking with Hillary, at least she has some decency!  Besides racist vote for racist.
16 | Jo Ann Ross Crane | 35 | 1344975568932025_1344989402263975 | Oh you don't even want me to repeat what my husband thinks of him...check out what he did to keep from going to Vietnam....yuck!!!!!
17 | Will Tooles | 18 | 1344975568932025_1345000782262837 | I thought he was there to help Trump? How dare he call him out like that. Criminal... how many cases/lawsuits has he settled? Who's going to court in December for allegedly raping a 13 year old? Scam artist? Who's scheduled in court on 28 November for selling fake degrees at a fake university? Hell, this dude should've stole a speech like Melania if he was going to help.
18 | Matthew Esper | 20 | 1344975568932025_785701391567657 | Ted doesn't speak for Michigan. In fact he barely speaks human. His endorsement of Trump reminds me of Himmler endorsing Hitler. These people are insane and hopefully their inbred gene-pool will die out soon.
19 | Beverly Bratcher | 12 | 1344975568932025_905119032966155 | People of Michigan all races, religions and genders get out, get your neighbors and friends out and vote blue!!! If you do not vote you have not a prayer because Donald Trump is a piece of crap now, and as president cares NOTHING about what happens to you!! Hillary will help all of us he will take and give nothing!
20 | Jan Vilkin Kessel | 12 | 1344975568932025_1345000712262844 | I'll be so glad when these low level dumber than dirt people go off the airwaves so we don't have to be bombarded with the "Trump effect" on a daily basis. Bye bye Donald!
21 | Gail Hill | 8 | 1344975568932025_785721374898992 | Yes, a really great embarrassment to not only the State of Michigan and it's people, but to himself and the Republican party. Is this what they've really come down to. Is this how you see your presidential candidate. Grabbing his crotch. Really?
22 | Linda Gonzalez | 9 | 1344975568932025_1814463902145138 | I'm a democrat... and I'm sure there are republicans turning in their graves right now... am sure I hope there are conservatives praying for this quack and Donald Duck. Michigan I'm sorry that this idiot is representing your Republican Party... stick with HILLARY and avoid the embarrassment.
23 | Adeola Olamide | 12 | 1344975568932025_905078802970178 | I never thought I would ever agree with this nutcase..."We can not vote for criminals,liars and scam artist"... I agree and that is why we are voting blue ....and saying HELL NO to trump...Thank you for supporting Hillary Clinton.
24 | Mark Foster | 9 | 1344975568932025_905110692966989 | What he did was a secret salute in the Trump society. Like a secret handshake. The only difference is when beautiful women are around well....they grab them by the P. Hey they are stars and can get away with it......(sarcasm)
25 | Rose Freeh | 6 | 1344975568932025_1344998938929688 | Deplorables on all walks of life, trump has a list of lawsuits and charges againt him with proof, screwing people out of money, bankruptsy and not paying his employees,  not paying taxes, taking advantage of everyone including women

Even more sad is that our Military is fighting terrorists who are receiving funding from the same governments also giving money to the Clinton Foundation. Head scratcher....
3 | Alan Pearlman | 0 | 1344981232264792_1345027978926784 | I tuned in MSNBC to hear the latest news about the election and I was delighted to see Katy Tur anchoring the Live With Thomas Roberts program.

Will Donald J. Trump win 270 electoral votes tomorrow?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mario Y Frank | 1166 | 1344960665600182_1344962248933357 | Voting for Hillary Clinton because we need an adult in the White House
2 | Maree A. Gallagher | 942 | 1344960665600182_1344963032266612 | She's referring to Interstate 270, as they make their escape...
3 | John Moore | 1067 | 1344960665600182_1344962762266639 | Take another valium Kellyanne. You will not get to 270 easily. Vote for Hillary the only qualified and prepared leader to move our country forward.
4 | Catherine Schoch | 559 | 1344960665600182_1344962518933330 | Hillary will be our next President, can't wait to cast my vote for her in Pa.
5 | Rhonda Ludlow | 275 | 1344960665600182_1344964158933166 | Trump not going to drain crap I guess his supporters didn't see the 1998 people article where trump said if he ever ran he would run as a Republican because Republican believe anything their stupid. Google it
6 | Robin Lewallen | 224 | 1344960665600182_1344965762266339 | The only people that were surprised that Obama won in 2012 were the Republicans!!! Trump uses the polls in his favor when he's ahead and discredits them when he's losing .It's not even going to be close tomorrow. Why do you think he keeps talking about a rigged  election !!! Only people who know they are losing, say that!!!! IS IT TUESDAY YET !!!!!
7 | Carol Aulwes Jakl | 181 | 1344960665600182_1344970902265825 | I muted Kellyanne...couldn't listen to other word out of her mouth...always spin, spin never answers a question.  Hopefully, the whole lot of them will be gone after tomorrow.

9 | Hope Obioma Opara | 203 | 1344960665600182_1344964392266476 | Donald Trump, the King of Bankruptcy, professional conman, draft dodger, tax cheat and sexual predator is a psychotic self-absorbed narcissist. His style of hate-mongering politics makes America look like a third world country. The fact that he is even being considered for president is shameful. VOTE BLUE.
10 | KC Lawson | 94 | 1344960665600182_1344975372265378 | I will be at the poling place bright and early here in WV proudly casting my vote for HILLARY CLINTON!!!!
11 | James Carol Dodson | 50 | 1344960665600182_1344971248932457 | The only route that would get Trump to the White House is the Hi way to Hell. At least that's the one we'll all be on if he gets Elected. He should have been using AC / DC 'S Song all along as his Campaign' s theme.
12 | Kim Best | 51 | 1344960665600182_1344976118931970 | For some reason this lady annoys me. She has the same silly smile on her face during every interview, and repeats the same sentences everytime.
13 | Billy Carter | 53 | 1344960665600182_1344974892265426 | Trump I believe has no route to 270 electoral votes. Racist and uneducated old white guys are a dying breed. The GOP didn't win in 2008 or 2012, won't win in 2016 and can't win in 2020 unless they drop what they are doing and reinvent themselves. And they won't do it...to stubborn...to racist...and dying out.

15 | Katie LeClair | 42 | 1344960665600182_1344966072266308 | Maybe we should pass the hat for poor Kellyanne - who won't get paid when this is over bc she was hired to help him win, and he won't, so he won't be paying her...
16 | Edith Herring | 26 | 1344960665600182_1204572246265951 | It is amazing to watch a grown woman just say anything without any regard for the basis of truth. I hope teenagers of the world are not watching. She does it effortlessly...just like Trump. Amazing and disgusting at the same time. Like watching a horror movie.
17 | Michael Gladu | 21 | 1344960665600182_1344976862265229 | I predict that Trump will immediately call for a recount and when that doesnt go his way he will threaten to sue the government and The president which will be Hillary Clinton
18 | Blair D. Scott Sr. | 31 | 1344960665600182_1344973078932274 | ROFL, six different routes, to go back home and cry. Trump will not get 270, what kind of drug is she on, Kellyanne, go back to your Therapist, because you left your brain there. Hillary is going to wipe the ground with Trump. "Pride Comes Before Destruction"...Donald Trump is full of pride, so God had a plan to fulfill and it was that a "Strong Woman", would defeat and embarrass Trump. His worst "NIGHTMARE", is coming to pass, first a Woman will beat him, and then he will start to lose money. Trump is about to have a "Major Collapse". Pride has and can destroy the best and worst of people, and pride, has destroyed Trump...
19 | Raymond Bass | 32 | 1344960665600182_1344964205599828 | To those voters still undecided‚Ä¶. Which Candidate:01.	Threatened to lock up thousands of people? 02.	Threatened to lock up his opponent? 03.	Threatened to deport millions, including children born here? 04.	Threatened to force people to wear Religious ID‚Äôs 05.	Threatened to have people beaten up, shot? 06.	Threatened to get rid of the Environmental Protection Agency? 07.	Threatened to privatize Medicare and Social Security? 08.	Threatened to raise the retirement age and benefits for Social Security? 09.	Threatened Freedom of the Press? 10.	Threatened to assassinate foreign leaders? 11.	Threatened to refuse to accept defeat, should he lose? There‚Äôs a common thread through all of this, I think. However, it doesn‚Äôt matter what I think, as I have already made up my mind. Let me ask you: After reading the above, which candidate do You think represents a Threat, to this country, to you, to me, to your children, grandchildren?  He is clearly not worthy of your vote.rb 7 November2 2016
20 | Mary Louise | 24 | 1344960665600182_1344976285598620 | Dream on Kellyanne! You have lied so much you have no idea what the truth is anymore even when given facts. When this election is over I am looking forward to NOT seeing this woman's face again!
21 | Kirstien Demuth | 31 | 1344960665600182_1344960785600170 | Listen up people, we are running out of time! Can you imagine the excitement on Wednesday morning when the Syrian people are told that Hillary won? They are going to be so happy knowing that they can now seek refuge in the USA! Hillary 2016
22 | Timothy Reents | 14 | 1344960665600182_1344971152265800 | Hiding "voters" under sheets....Okay, fine. Let's dispense with the politesse. DT is a nazi. He grew up in the shadows of a father who was arrested at a KKK rally in the 1930s. At the time he took over the family business in the 1970s, DT was forced to settle with the Nixon administration for rampant racism in his business practices. In the 1980s, he took out a newspaper ad calling for the execution of five black teenagers accused of a crime they conclusively did not commit. In the 1990s, his ex wife told a court he keeps a copy of Hitler's speeches for bedside reading at night. In the 2000s, he led the birther movement to delegitimize the country's first African American president. Throughout his campaign, he has associated with known racists. He has frequently retweeted posts by neo nazis. So yes, let's dispose of political correctness. Donald Trump is a racist and a fascist, the combination of which makes him a nazi. And people who support him, whether they admit it or not, either sympathize with his racism and hatred or live in a moral universe where Hillary's emails etc. somehow supersede the total moral failure of their candidate, a greedy, megalomaniac narcissist who exploits fear and hatred to advance his personal interests. So as you take a look at the profile pictures of the people in this comment stream who stand up to defend this indefensible man, kindly notice a pattern: they are almost all white, indeed almost all white men. They are inadvertently outing themselves. But don't kid yourselves. We see you. And we know who you are.
23 | Janine Smith Sevey | 13 | 1344960665600182_1638441686453273 | I got to admit, she is the best at being the worst campaign manager, ever! No organization, no ground plan, lies continuously and has a immature, spioled child as a client! Hope she doesn't plan on either getting paid or having any kind of career after this!!!Oh and thanks to her, any woman wanting to be a campaign manager in the future is screwed!
24 | LaVern Truchot Jr. | 6 | 1344960665600182_1344975258932056 | Last I seen he maybe had one way to 270. Even that he had to hit it right on other than that he better get a concession speech ready. If not hell will break loose on the rest of us with all the supremacy militia groups around, civil war.
25 | Dave Haddix | 13 | 1344960665600182_1344965328933049 | It won't be so bad. We'll only be in the internment camps for about 10 years before climate change boils the oceans and we all drown anyway so ya know it's a win win.

Ask his five children from multiple mothers, with one born out of wedlock.Can Trump bring jobs back to America? Ask the makers of the 628 outsourced products, primarily to China, offered by Ivanka Trump's company. Can Trump really unify both parties?Just ask the 163 Republican officials who oppose him publicly.Does Trump have the temperament needed for the job? Ask the 50 Republican officials who call him a "National Security Risk".Is Trump really " With You "?No. Time and time again he has shown he is first and foremost a business man.

20 | Tracy Curry Beam | 7 | 1344913025604946_1344916755604573 | When you are forced to pay a penalty because you cannot afford health insurance (yes, some can't afford even Obamacare), then you are no longer a free country. When we have open borders instead of knowing who is coming into our country, we are a country destine to fall. When illegal immigrants take priority over our veterans, homeless and the poor, we no longer are a country that cares for her own first. Remember this when you cast your ballot tomorrow. Don't vote for Hillary just because she is a woman. There will be better women to chose from later in our time.
21 | John Moore | 6 | 1344913025604946_1344943905601858 | Hillary is the only prepared and qualified candidate to lead our already great country forward. Vote for Hillary and a straight democratic ticket, time to stop the GOP gridlock in congress!
22 | Debra Schneck | 0 | 1344913025604946_1344993162263599 | Just listened to Chuck Todd on MSNBC, talking about closing times for state voting.  Yes, the bulk of the voting for Indiana will close at 6 pm, but not ALL.  The Chicago area, which extends into Indiana, and the SW corner are on Central Time, and will not close until 7 pm (EST).  The Chicago suburbs are traditionally largely Democratic.  I would not call the state, esp for Bayh and Gregg, until ALL the polls close.  I am sure that a producer will help Chuck Todd figure it out, but just in case ....
23 | Deidra Sands | 2 | 1344913025604946_1344934428936139 | Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign has set a historic standard for lack of transparency.

Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump are tied in the latest poll from battleground Florida.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Patricia Prokop | 181 | 1344854948944087_1344865838942998 | Hillary has an excellent ground game. I've had visits from two different volunteers making sure I plan to vote. Never before in my thirty years of residence in this Ohio village has this happened.
2 | Andy Charles | 105 | 1344854948944087_1344857082277207 | I can't way to get all of my handouts!!! Oh wait, I am a white middle class conservative, I'll be paying for those handouts. Dang, I need to think about making a change. Let's go Hillary !! Keep America as a poverty crime ridden cesspool. America is great. Hillary 2016!! We will miss you Barack:)
3 | Belinda Sullivan | 67 | 1344854948944087_1344858338943748 | One thing for sure no one should be getting cocky. Polls are rolling all over the place these past 3 days. Polls do not matter. They are wrong more than they are right. The early voting lines were long. Be prepared to wait. Get out there and VOTE
4 | Blair D. Scott Sr. | 48 | 1344854948944087_1344875252275390 | The people have spoken by "Voting Early", and most of them have given their "VOTES", to Hillary. Trump pissed off the Latinos, and they came out in full force, for Hillary, all over America, he attacked the Blacks, with his "What else do you have", and we aren't "Voting", for him, he attacked the Muslims, and they're not "Voting", for him, he "Degraded Women", and that was his "NAIL", in the coffin, he then attacked the Jews, and they laughed and said, we're with her. So Trump, you became your own enemy with your "Evil Heart, and Wicked Mouth". We all heard you and you kept repeating it, even your followers, repeated what you said. I'm not following the polls, I'm following my feet, straight to the "Voting Box", and "Vote", for the only person, "Qualified, Fit, Cares, Stable, Experienced, Mentally Capable", and that person name is "Hillary Clinton", "I'm With Her"
5 | Robert R. Ferguson | 36 | 1344854948944087_1344868078942774 | I can believe my home state would go for such a sick person as Trump -- let's return to some sensible ideas of bring everyone together and moving forward, and that includes modern, sensible
6 | Blair D. Scott Sr. | 19 | 1344854948944087_1344913592271556 | Trump, when you attack People of Color remember, we have a way of making you pay for what you said, it was done without "Violence, or Riots". We all decided to make sure we "VOTE", and not allow, a "Racist, Bigot", to be President. We People of Color, have had enough of the "Racist Remarks" against us, because we look different, and we all don't live in a "Poor Neighborhoods", that look like "Afghanistan", we all don't live in "High Crime Places", we do have a "A Lot To Lose", and what we have to lose, is allowing you Trump, to be President, because you would give the "KKK, White Supremacy, Alt-Right", all the permission they need, to take us back, and we aren't having it. So us "People of Color", we gave our "Votes", to the only person, "Qualified, Cares, Not a Racist, Fit, Stable" and that person name is "Hillary Clinton", we're with her..
7 | David Aldo | 32 | 1344854948944087_1344861582276757 | I voted more than a week ago. Have you voted yet? If not, get out there and vote today or tomorrow...and remember, you have the law on your side. There will be Vote Suppressors out their in full force. Just remember these few rules and laws that protect you.‚Ä¢ Campaigners, or in this case,  Trumpian Agitators and Agent Provocateurs cannot stand right in front of a polling  location. They must be 100 feet away. If they aren't, then you have a legal right and obligation to let poll workers know...and they should be able to correct the action.‚Ä¢ If the Campaigner/Agitator blocks your entrance, you need to tell a poll worker that they need to enforce the rules. If you can't get the poll worker because you are scared...then you have a right to call law enforcement to assist you.‚Ä¢ If the Campaigner/Agitator touches you in anyway, that is considered assault and you have the law on your side.Don't be afraid to vote and to be intimidated not to vote. But, don't confront them either. They are angry, hateful, negative and many cases dangerous. They have an agenda and one goal in mind! That is to keep Patriotic Americans from exercising one the most valued rights in this country...and that is your right and Patriotic duty to vote. Democrats, Liberals, Progressives and Rational Republicans...Be Strong...Be Calm...Be vigilant...Be Persistent...Stand Your Ground...and don't let them intimidate you. The best way to prevent them from accomplishing their attempts to suppress your vote...is WITH your vote. Let's Elect the First woman POTUS in History...and #VoteBlueNoMatterWho! All the way down the ballot. Let's Give Hillary Clinton a Congress that WILL NOT obstruct Hillary Clinton and prevent our country from progressing forward!
8 | James K Jefferson Jr | 12 | 1344854948944087_1344880372274878 | I don't care what the polls says, you can't win with a white only vote and all whites are not voting Trump or are we not supposed to understand this?
9 | Frank A. Mirabella | 5 | 1344854948944087_1344876028941979 | I just don't get why so many people with political expertise are calling Florida for Clinton. Most of the major media polls are using a model where Democrat's turnout is being oversampled by 8% to 9%. The early voting returns don't indicate that is what's going to occur on Tuesday. These same major polls are indicating only a 1% to 2% win for Clinton in Florida. The polls have more than already over compensated for any surprises such as the extraordinary Puerto Rican voter turnout.
10 | Ryan Hosein | 1 | 1344854948944087_1120452244740126 | Are we fired up and ready to go?!!? Let's elect the first female president who we know has stood her whole life for making change for the better. Let's vote blue down the ticket! Get your friends and family out to vote! Elect Hillary Clinton!!
11 | Carolyn Hill | 0 | 1344854948944087_1120386208080063 | Everyone should vote intelligent, especially if you get social security,health care and jobs left during Bush administration.Michigan governor is the worst . Florida governor Rick Scott would not allow massive transit from city to city Donald Trump is going to cut you off your Social Security, Medicare, a college students financial aid will be privatized. You pay a third party to get less money.
12 | Alan Pearlman | 1 | 1344854948944087_1120388561413161 | I tuned in MSNBC to hear the latest news about the election and I was delighted to see Katy Tur anchoring the Live With Thomas Roberts program.  She spoke eloquently, handled her guests masterfully, managed the screen changes expertly, and enthusiastically transitioned from MSNBC Promotional Announcements to commercials. Katy Tur has always been one of the best reporters out in the field, but now I am looking forward to seeing her grace the studio more often.
13 | Thea Limon | 4 | 1344854948944087_1344872078942374 | "I never heard that. I thought Vince Foster was the only person the Clinton's killed. How naive I was." After Wikileaks dropped more emails today that included this one, unknown sources shut down their website and Twitter stopped trending #DNCleaks2.
14 | Sam T. Abraham | 2 | 1344854948944087_1344881768941405 | Everyone seems to focus on how he's worth so much money and is supposedly such a great businessman...but ignore the multiple times he's gone bankrupt. Maybe he thinks if he puts the US into bankruptcy, it will wipe the slate clean like in a bank/business situation?
15 | Lisa Paoline | 0 | 1344854948944087_1344926062270309 | If you Vote for Clinton....please REMEMBER...When you are voting for a woman's right to choose you are also voting for late-term abortions even through the 9th month!When you are voting to welcome hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees because you want to give them a chance for a better life here in America... You understand that Hillary herself said Vetting canNOT be done!! And- There is no way to guarantee that some coming through will not be coming here to do us harm. And.....You will also be voting for you & your neighbors and all of us in America to financially care for these individuals-  that means their housing, their Healthcare, their food stamps, their education, etc.....No matter what You are being told....it will be taxpayers like us that foot the bill!!!  You will be also voting for the influx of unavoidable side-effect of many new and unfamiliar and possibly diseases and illnesses that we in the U.S. have previously eradicated.  You will also be voting in favor of having these individuals fight for jobs that many Americans are struggling for obtain or keep right now. When you vote for Hillary Clinton you will be voting for open borders.  And you might be thinking that you are doing a wonderful thing for those that are trying to get in America to make a better life for themselves... but remember-  those individuals who will be coming through will need some type of government assistance.  With all of these extra people to care for we are going to have even a greater difficulty caring for those that are living in or around the poverty line!  It could also reduce our ability to keep those who have been sent away because they committed dangerous crimes!! (Like the man who had been deported 5 times for various crimes and returned to rape a 10 year old girl on a bus!!!)When you are voting for Hillary Clinton you are voting for higher taxes for the "wealthy" -  but that also means that the "wealthy" will have less money to put back into our economy.  Eventually after YEARS of steep tax increases, some of these "wealthy," may not qualify to have to contribute, as they may become middle class.  After YEARS of the wealthy being dried up after being heavily tapped into... the next group of people to be taxed will be the middle class.  (We cannot rationally assume that the "wealthy" have unending streams of income.)You will also be voting to continue with Obamacare- and this year alone premiums are going up 100% in some states!!!You will be voting for a candidate that claimed she is for women's rights but... you will also be voting for the candidate that through her foundation has accepted hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign governments that oppress and openly kill women and girls in the streets for not conforming to radical religious beliefs!!! You will be voting for the candidate that  States her opponent is Putin's BFF but you'll also be voting for the candidate they gave Russia 20% of our uranium!!! You will be voting for a candidate that dodged FBI charges of criminal wrongdoing in her recent email investigation... but you will also be voting for the candidate that the FBI director called Reckless and used EXTREME CARELESSNESS in handling Government correspondence, that with 99% CERTAINTY WAS HACKED BY Five ADVERSARIAL FOREIGN CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES!!!
16 | Larry Langenbrunner | 3 | 1344854948944087_1344886222274293 | I think the writings on the wall. Time to relo to a real blue state. Too many confused old white conservative in Ohio.I won't be missed here or will I miss here in  near Cincy.
17 | Victor Ladota | 1 | 1344854948944087_1344904645605784 | The polls are not as accurate as in past elections.Many people only have cell phones and there may be people who have never voted before that will vote this time. Turnout is key and this election has a large margin of error.
18 | Debbie Parker | 0 | 1344854948944087_1344917508937831 | Here is more - Found this ....BILL CLINTON'S LOVING WIFE --- by DICK MORRISIf you happen to see the Bill Clinton five minute TV ad for Hillary in which he introduces the commercial by saying he wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary's background, beware as I was there for most of their presidency and know them better than just about anyone. I offer a few corrections:Bill says: "In law school Hillary worked on legal services for the poor."Facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in 'Law School' was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a 'Federal Agent.' She went to Court every day as part of a Law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.Bill says: "Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a Children's rights project for poor kids."Facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.Bill says: "Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers."Facts are: She flunked the D.C. bar exam, 'Yes', flunked it, it is a matter of record, and only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas, 'None', and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She did not join the prestigious Rose Law Firm until Bill became Arkansas Attorney General and was made a partner only after he was elected Arkansas Governor.Bill says: "President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its Chairman."Facts are: The appointment was in exchange for Bill's support for Carter in his 1980 primary against Ted Kennedy. Hillary then became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter's choice to be chairman.Bill says: "She served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital."Facts are: Yes she did. But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the Wal-Mart Board of Directors, for a substantial fee. She was silent about their labor and health care practices.Bill says: "Hillary didn't succeed at getting health care for all Americans in 1994 but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance."Facts are: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. I know; I helped to negotiate the deal. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals' tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.Bill says: "Hillary was the face of America all over the World." (LOL)Facts are: Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House. Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them.Bill says: "Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for Children's and Women's issues."Facts are: Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation. One set up a national park in Puerto Rico. A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid 911 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire N.Y. delegation. Presently she is trying to have the US memorialize Woodstock.Here is what bothers me more than anything else about Hillary Clinton. She has done everything possible to weaken the President and our Country (that's you and me) when it comes to the 'War on Terror'.1. She wants to close GITMO and move the combatants to the USA where they would have access to our legal system.2. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of suspected Al Qaeda phone calls to/from the USA.3. She wants to grant constitutional rights to enemy combatants captured on the battlefield.4. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of money transfers between suspected Al Qaeda cells and supporters in the USA.5. She wants to eliminate the type of interrogation tactics used by the Military & CIA where coercion might be used when questioning known terrorists even though such tactics might save American lives.One cannot think of a single 'Bill', Hillary has introduced or a single comment she has made that would tend to strengthen our Country in the 'War on Terror'. But, one can think of a lot of comments she has made that weaken our Country and makes it a more dangerous situation for all of us. Bottom line: She goes hand in hand with the ACLU on far too many issues where common sense is abandoned.Share this with everyone you know, ask them to prove Dick Morris wrong. Think about it - he's (Dick Morris) said all of this openly, thus if he were not truthful he'd be liable for 'Defamation of Character' !And you better believe Hillary would sue him.Her winning in 2016 means the final death knell for America! Her whole public life has been a LIE.By Dick Morris, former political advisor to President Bill ClintonTHERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE UNAWARE OF THESE FACTS
19 | Mark Deda | 0 | 1344854948944087_1207958469261961 | Well‚Ä¶ the first female president should be someone to be proud of, not a felon who cheated and lied. She will be more remembered for her scandals than for being the first female president. Is Trump perfect? no, he isn't, but clinton is who will make your life a real hell. Think about it. Thank you - #TrumpPence #MAGA

Alright Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Michigan, California, Illinois, welfare states of America here we come!
21 | Gary Pause | 1 | 1344854948944087_1344989482263967 | Such a sad testament to the utter ignorance or stupidity of so many American voters. Russia's " useful idiot" or one of the most qualified, stable, competent candidates in our history. And millions have chosen a deranged, orange psychopath.

It's going to feel good to say "You fools elected her, you fools deserve to feel the pain"..... The smart ones who saw through her, saw through  the corrupt people who have supported and protected her, we will have taken steps to make sure her reign in power has little affect on our lives............ fools.....all of you left supporters! Enjoy the dictatorship you have put into power.
23 | Franklin Strum | 0 | 1344854948944087_1344876658941916 | The Republic will fall after this election. Hillary will become sole authority and leader of the US. Congress will yield no power. The Courts will rule Hillary's executive orders Constitutional. Her decrees will make state rights no longer exist. I hope people who put Hillary in office especially Republicans are happy. First step go for the guns. As Hillary said she will reverse the Heller decision and make us like Australia. 1,000,000 more unborn babies will die after she lifts all abortion restrictions and has taxpayers funded abortions. Small businesses will be forced to close because they refuse to facilitate a gay marriage (which is an event). Your daughter will be forced to shower with grown men in public locker rooms because the men believe they are women. Yes indeed our nation will be no more

Hillary Clinton campaigned with Gold Star father Khizr Khan, who famously riled Donald J. Trump with his DNC speech questioning whether Trump had read the U.S. Constitution. 

Full coverage of the final sprint to Election Day: http://nbcnews.to/2etCM0g
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Derek Leslie | 161 | 1560788930607798_1560792803940744 | Mr Khan, standing on the memory of his dead son. His son was a patriot. Mr Khan, you are bought and paid for by the DNC. It is sickening the way you have used your son.
2 | Monique LAbb√©e | 119 | 1560788930607798_1560791413940883 | M. Khan got a VERY big amount of money from Clinton foundation after his first apperence on Hillary rally (for his lawfirm webbsite or something) You may verified but it's out there.
3 | Jack Morris | 37 | 1560788930607798_1560795620607129 | Ten reasons to vote Democrat #10. I vote Democrat because I love the fact that I can now marry whatever I want. I've decided to marry my German Shepherd.#9. I vote Democrat because I believe oil companies' profits of 4% on a gallon of gas are obscene, but the government taxing the same gallon at 15% isn't.#8. I vote Democrat because I believe the government will do a better job of spending the money I earn than I would.#7. I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is fine as long as nobody is offended by it.#6. I vote Democrat because I'm way too irresponsible to own a gun, and I know that my local police are all I need to protect me from murderers and thieves. I am also thankful that we have a 911 service that gets police to your home in order to identify your body after a home invasion. It will take the police an average of about 15 minutes to get to your house; 00 buckshot travels at about 1200 ft/sec.#5. I vote Democrat because I'm not concerned about millions of babies being aborted so long as we keep all death row inmates alive and comfy.#4. I vote Democrat because I think illegal aliens have a right to free health care, education, and Social Security benefits, and we should take away Social Security from those who paid into it.#3. I vote Democrat because I believe that businesses should not be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to break even and give the rest away to the government for redistribution as the Democrat Party sees fit.#2. I vote Democrat because I believe liberal judges need to rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit fringe kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters.And, the #1 reason I vote Democrat is because I think it's better to pay $billions$ for oil to people who hate us, but not drill our own because it might upset some endangered beetle, gopher, or fish here in America. We don't care about the beetles, gophers, or fish in those other countries

Mr. Kahn wasn't bought by the DNC. He sought out the Democrats because of trump's disgusting behavior. If you support trump then hold your head down with shame, you too are a disgusting human.
6 | Jeff Hollifield | 16 | 1560788930607798_1560816667271691 | Khizr Khan was the 5th choice by the DNC, four others refused to stoop to the level Hillary wanted them to. Khan had no issue with it, especially with the $500,000 payment given to him for doing it.

HE is a Clinton Foundation Donor, clearly not the poor innocent man whos son went into the military to get away from them. Nice try Corrupt Hillary, dont you have an appointment on pedophile island with your fellow pedophiles Weiner and Huma?

11 | Timothy Fan | 2 | 1560788930607798_1560821957271162 | FBI just made announcement that there is nothing regarding in Abedin's Hillary emails, FBI stands the decision they made in last July, no charge to Hillary. Let's come out to vote for Hillary on Tuesday 11/8. We all felt the hatry in trump, but, talks won't help, this is the time to take action to vote for Hillary.
12 | Valerie Monique | 2 | 1560788930607798_1560930600593631 | I was at that rally last night and Mr. Khan, you are not being bought like others may believe. Your sentiments were felt and words resonated loudly. This is the passion of a parent who doesn't agree with Republicans or Donal Trump-- and their supporters are mad. Like you said, there is no place for women, people of color, nor muslims in Donald Trump's America. I can believe that based on what I've read, heard, and the racist words hurled at me as a Latina. #imwithher  #strongertogether

He specializes in "citizenship for sale program" where people can buy their way into the country for a fee of 500k. And the list goes on and on. He is not his son and I am sure he and his son probably didnt see eye to eye and now cant defend himself.

You are also as ignorant as we all think you are. It's sad when people think a Sociopath like Trump is fit to lead this country. Truly sad. ...

We are for the application of the existing immigration laws, which have been the most generous laws of any nation on the face of the earth and they have worked well to keep our country safe.

23 | John McCarthy | 1 | 1560788930607798_1560922673927757 | VIA| On Sunday, Wikileaks gave Hillary Clinton less than a 24-hour window to drop out of the race or they will dump something that will destroy her ‚Äúcompletely.‚ÄùRecently, Julian Assange confirmed that WikiLeaks was not working with the Russian government, but in their pursuit of justice they are obligated to release anything that they can to bring light to a corrupt system ‚Äì and who could possibly be more corrupt than Crooked Hillary?‚ÄúThe Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything. Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That‚Äôs false ‚Äì we can say that the Russian government is not the source,‚Äù Assange said in a recent interview. ‚ÄúHillary Clinton is just one person. I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick ‚Äì for example faint ‚Äì as a result of going on, and going with their ambitions. But she represents a whole network of people, and a whole network of relationships with particular states.‚Äù‚ÄúHey, @HillaryClinton, you have until Monday to drop out, or we will destroy you completely,‚Äù the cryptic tweet says.

Could Newt Gingrich could be the next secretary of state?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Marie Inneo | 681 | 1344796568949925_1344799442282971 | There will be no Trump White House, unless he paints that NY tower of his. So, in 48 hours, Gingrich and Guiliani will fade back into irrelevance, where they belong.
2 | Bill Neighbors | 480 | 1344796568949925_1344805492282366 | If you still need a reason to vote blue; there it is. An actual trio of thrice divorced philanderers pining for unlimited power and influence. For fucksake, can't this be Tuesday night already!?
3 | Kirstien Demuth | 255 | 1344796568949925_1344796798949902 | The difference between a Republican and a Democrat is a Republican wants you to live your life the way he wants you to. A Democrat wants you to live your life the way you want to. A Republican loves his government. A Democrat loves his country.

The problem is if he were win, the checks and balances would go out the window...A GOP supreme court, a GOP attorney general, a GOP FBI head...and a GOP congress..We would probably never have another election..As Maher said, "a facist once in, does not give up his power."

9 | Richard-Donna Cabrey | 61 | 1344796568949925_1344801238949458 | Copy from Facebook page of Kevin M Carney(opposing Views.) A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!

11 | Bob Stern | 12 | 1344796568949925_661949627307609 | The fact that these 2 jamokes (Giuliani, and Gingrich) are being mentioned as possibly being in the Orange Man's administration should immediately make you run to the election booth and cast your vote for Hillary!!
12 | Becky Hostetter | 12 | 1344796568949925_1344835978945984 | They are campaigning with Trump specifically to get appointed in his administration. We CANNOT allow this!!  Vote down Trump and ALL candidates who support him, and vote EVERY 2 YEARS from now on. Once we clear our local, state and federal governments of people like this, ALL our lives will improve!! Get it done America!!
13 | Angus Palo Grande | 14 | 1344796568949925_1344798205616428 | Hell no!! His going to try to get back  w/his ex wife he left a few years ago. Hillary is going to win. Newt is a disgrace for supporting Trump.
14 | Caitrin Bayard | 17 | 1344796568949925_1344837808945801 | Bunch of delusional old white men trying to hold on to antiquated ideologies of generations oppression...you do not represent us all...just those that a grasping & clawing trying to maintain your status...you will be defeated
15 | David Sillman | 22 | 1344796568949925_1344804512282464 | There will be no Trump White House. Trump will be prosecuted (and hopefully jailed), divorced and forever publicly disgraced within a year. Newt & Giuliani will hopefully drop dead (of natural causes) within a year too. Sorry, but they're a threat to society (and they've already lived long, reprehensible lives).
16 | Jacqueline Stevens | 11 | 1344796568949925_1344833302279585 | Not any surprise! Giuliani's ties to the FBI is how this all came about. Why else would he be with Trump? They're all racists. Let's be real.
17 | Edith Stanley | 9 | 1344796568949925_1797882893816776 | The only thing Gingrich and Giuliani will get after Election Day is a  new gig on Fox's propaganda channel where they will continue to spew all the hateful puke.
18 | Allison Attong-Rogers | 4 | 1344796568949925_661969073972331 | Well if people really vote for Trump tomorrow and the country will be run by some of the world's most famous liars and cheaters we are in a lot of trouble.  Multiple wives, cheaters, haters of anything not like them is what we will get.  Guiliani and Gingrich will of course run the White House because Trump of course does know what he is doing.   Vote Blue.  Vote Hillary Clinton #imwithher and remember the Democratic down ballots too.  We have to get the obstructionists in Congress out of office.
19 | Jim James | 3 | 1344796568949925_1797891747149224 | Gingrich and Giuliani? Abbott and Costello? Laurel and Hardy? The difference is the latter twosomes were comedians. The first two think people take them seriously. Seriously....????
20 | Rob Byrne | 2 | 1344796568949925_661941060641799 | They'll all be working diligently on Newt's previous proposal that the US spend its federal dollars developing condominiums on the Moon.  (You may have forgotten, he actually suggested it).
21 | Thomson Tembo | 0 | 1344796568949925_1344856558943926 | Sometimes, even when there are no formulas to certain situations or things in life, there is  surely a way to figure out things using ways and principles of relativity. Okay let's not involve the intricacies of physics too much here. What I'm Saying is that if you look at Giuliani and Gingrich and Huckabee last but not least , all have one thing in common,  they have tried to run for primary presidential  nomination and all have failed. That's one half of the status quo in the sphere of public observation thus far. Now if you were to reflect that status quo projecting it for the future, it still looks and reflects the same way the original one looks like. In other words, they say that if you are badly ( like power hungry) looking for something in life, it just never comes.
22 | Jeannie Elliott | 3 | 1344796568949925_661959153973323 | Trump says - If l lose what a big waste of time and money. Trump also said- He has a nice life he will go back to.  Hillary ran in 2008, lost and campaigned for Obama and was his SOS in his 1st term. She then takes on the incredibly difficult task of running again. Hillary doesn't give up and doesn't complain. And she loves this country enough to put herself out there for it twice!

24 | Deb Sherman | 5 | 1344796568949925_661951713974067 | Just one more reason not to vote Trump... we don't need these two idiots anywhere near the White House!!  But I guess "cheaters" stick together... just how many wives do they have between them??
25 | Joseph Matthews | 2 | 1344796568949925_1344804555615793 | I wish Newt, the greatest speaker in the history of the Congress, and Rudy Guliani, the greatest mayor in New York City's history, would join Mr. Trump's administration if he were elected. I'd also love to see Dr. Ben Carson as well. They are actually accomplished people, unlike some political hack appointees like other administrations appoint who have no clue what they're doing.

Gary Johnson: "I'm upset if either one of them win and that's why I'm in the race... I'm going to give people a first choice."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Charles Reese | 195 | 1344739275622321_1344742282288687 | Johnson is a bad joke.  His running mate has enough intelligence to understand that a vote for them would be a vote for Trump.
2 | Russ Sachleben | 117 | 1344739275622321_1344744345621814 | If Clinton and trump both died tomorrow their replacements will beat Johnson by the same margins. He isn't a choice but a small distraction
3 | Jennifer Moss Kincaid | 26 | 1344739275622321_1344755532287362 | If Johnson was a serious candidate maybe he could have made a difference, but he's not. I think the only way a third party could have changed this election is if Bernie Sanders ran as an independent - and then Trump would have won, so thank you Bernie.
4 | Richard S. Simon | 33 | 1344739275622321_1344759308953651 | Gary, I hold my nose when I see you on TV. To think that you consider yourself an alternative to Hillary is a national joke.
5 | Linda Barney | 11 | 1344739275622321_1344771242285791 | Johnsons running mate might have given them a chance at a bigger impact had he been the top of the ticket. Johnson is as bad as Trump when it comes to lack of baseline knowledge for even the average informed voter.
6 | Jill Love | 7 | 1344739275622321_1344929518936630 | Sorry Gary you seem nice enough but just not knowledgeable enough. Listen to your running mate.. your only helping a man you profess to dislike.. voting for Gary Johnson is voting for Donald Trump.. that's a fact..
7 | Al Plumlee | 6 | 1344739275622321_1344784965617752 | Johnson may have been paid by the Trump campaign to stay in the race so as to take votes away from Hillary. Just vote based on what your true interests are not those opinions planted in your brain by the Trump propagandists.
8 | Barbara Kiourkas | 13 | 1344739275622321_1344778352285080 | No offense, but Gary Johnson would be my last choice, right behind Daffy Duck. If Bill Weld had run instead, we might be talking a different ball game..
9 | David Colman | 0 | 1344739275622321_1345122772250638 | Donald Trump won the Republican nomination by a massive margin spending so little money, and a rejection from the entire establishment of his Party, so this seems to go against the central message of Gary Johnson's candidacy.
10 | Ed Levine | 1 | 1344739275622321_1344964842266431 | Let's see, he didn't know that Aleppo was a place, he thinks that global warming doesn't matter because eventually the sun will swallow the earth, (in a few billion years) he couldn't name on current world leader, but he thinks he should be president? That is beyond dumb.
11 | Alan Pearlman | 0 | 1344739275622321_1345028288926753 | I tuned in MSNBC to hear the latest news about the election and I was delighted to see Katy Tur anchoring the Live With Thomas Roberts program.  She spoke eloquently, handled her guests masterfully, managed the screen changes expertly, and enthusiastically transitioned from MSNBC Promotional Announcements to commercials. Katy Tur has always been one of the best reporters out in the field, but now I am looking forward to seeing her grace the studio more often.
12 | Todd Sabine | 1 | 1344739275622321_1344886652274250 | Then you're going to be upset Ya ding-a-ling! Because one of them "IS" going to win. And because of you pulling some votes there's a chance Trump will win. So thanks for that! Go out, create your movement, and come back when you can be more than a spoiler. There is to much on the line for your to little, to late, marginal effort.
13 | Janie Romine | 1 | 1344739275622321_1344940975602151 | Ohhhh bless your heart Gary, go smoke a bowl - even your running mate has put country over self in this race. Thank you Gov Weld for your wise and honest words about what's important in this election. #NeverTrump

16 | Sam Shappell | 3 | 1344739275622321_1344827875613461 | Johnson has my vote tired of hearing about hwo bad the other 2 candidates are. Johnson is the only one who wont be corrupted or split the country in half.

18 | Sharon Olski | 1 | 1344739275622321_1344785255617723 | A "choice" that, sadly, simply wastes their vote used on you. No electoral coming your way, and your scatter brained non-answers also showed no ability for this office.

21 | Robbie Lee | 4 | 1344739275622321_1344759068953675 | And why is that you didn't know about Aleppo or know a foreign leader name and you're talking about being president you'll have to know their names if you're going to be working with them in the future
22 | Bruce Lewis | 3 | 1344739275622321_1344762825619966 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.REASONS TO NOT VOTE HILLARY‚ö†If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china.

23 | Jo Anna Jameson | 1 | 1344739275622321_1344811048948477 | Johnson implies that it does not matter whether DT or HRC is elected President. Most of us do not agree. We do agree with former Gov. William Weld who spoke out for HRC recently. Thank you for your courage Gov. Weld.
24 | Joseph Matthews | 2 | 1344739275622321_1344756882287227 | Why does MSNBC or CNN bother to pay reporters to follow the Clinton campaign? They will not ask her any real or tough questions if she holds her once-in-a-lifetime one-minute press gatherings. They all like Chris Matthews and Barack Obama seem to have a warm chill run up their legs whenever Mrs. Clinton bothers to grace them with her time. A reporter just prefaced the press corps' lone question "question" to Mrs. Clinton this morning with the phrase "you have faced so much prejudice" in this campaign. Boy, that's real objective and shows she's really searching for the truth. Every reporter "covering" Mrs. Clinton should wear cheerleading uniforms and wave pom poms. I always wondered what Pravda looked like in the old Soviet Union and why they would sell their souls and sell out their countrymen by reporting nothing but propaganda. I now see that same propaganda every day on the government-run media like CNN and MSNBC. I cannot fathom the amount of embarrassment and shame these reporters and on-air analysts must feel deep-down inside for being nothing but shills for these corrupt people. It would be an embarrassment if she is the first woman to wear the mantle as the first female to be elected president. Chelsea spent $3 million from the Clinton Foundation to pay for her extravagant wedding and there's no reporting except on the one fair and balanced network on that? Sad.

Offer a ride, whatever is needed. This is SO important to our country! We MUST turn out in force, and that means ALL of us! Every single vote counts and matters! Let's get it done! #Trump2016

Podesta stopped short of calling for Comey's resignation, instead calling for an end to "worrisome" leaks from within the FBI.

1 | Michael Marki | 50 | 1344680075628241_1344690512293864 | Never thought I would say this but James Carville was right in something he said. In an interview on Morning Joe during a discussion about corruption in Clinton Foundation, Carville said " someone's going to burn in hell over this" referring to people who said the foundation was corrupt. He was right because The Clintons and all there little corrupt minions will be burning in hell! Tell me how $2 million dollars of foundation money paid for Chelsea's wedding is charity work. Tell me how Chelsea can afford a $10 million pad in New York. This crime family makes the Mafia look like a bunch of rookies. How many stupid Americans will vote to put this corrupt family in the white House.
2 | Eileen Tharp | 59 | 1344680075628241_1344685465627702 | If the corrupt Obama administration will not bring Hillary to Justice than we the people MUST. Trumpsters make your voices heard loud and strong tomorrow at the ballot box
3 | TJ Frisk | 12 | 1344680075628241_1344703432292572 | Imagine, if you will, an FBI that would keep after Trump to expose and bring charges against him for tax evasion, fraud, sexual misconduct, voter intimidation, inciting violence against political opponents, collusion with Russia and Putin with rigging of the USA elections...etc etc.It is only then will the majority of Americans ever trust the FBI again
4 | Nick Cain | 12 | 1344680075628241_1344708378958744 | It's cute how everyone thinks this is over. They are still investigating the Clinton Foundation. The email issue with Hillary goes wayyyyyy beyond her time as Sec of State. The Clintons have woven their tentacles deep into every dark corner of the world... and there are a lot of fish left to fry. This isn't going away any time soon. :-)
5 | Janice LeTourneau | 3 | 1344680075628241_1344722615623987 | It appears that the FBI has set a new precedent for our National Security. If you do not feel like our classified information needs to be on a secure server, It just doesn't have to be. So, the sailor who was just sent to jail will be freed since no charges should have been made. Just like Hillary. The general that was sent to prison must also be set free and not charges should have been made to begin with. Just like Hillary. The FBI has shown that people without clearance can read classified emails just as Hillary's maid did. Maybe even Snowden should be able to come back to the US and all charges dropped. We demand that all that happens to prove that Hillary hasn't been given special treatment. Our government has been turned into a sham in the past 8 years. This is nothing but corruption.
6 | Deatra S Cragg | 5 | 1344680075628241_1344730942289821 | The only "facts" Republicans refer to begin with the following: It looks bad, it could be, it might be, we can assume. it is alleged, supposedly, it may be, it appears, we can only assume......well you guys get the point!   There is NOT and has NEVER been a so called, smoking gun. But let's not confuse trumpettes with real facts. It would destroy them. They do so enjoy reveling in their hatred of Hillary!
7 | Steve Lynn | 6 | 1344680075628241_1344703205625928 | If Trey Gowdy and Jason Chafftez were not using all this mess to get re-elected for the last 4 years maybe congress would have got the peoples work done instead of wasting 100 million on a lawyer witch hunt! Sometimes you need proof.
8 | Peter H Brouillard | 5 | 1344680075628241_1344707258958856 | We can fix this problem on Tuesday and in the future. Just do not vote for Hillary. If you do not like him, do not vote for Trump. Vote for the other 2 candidates or write in Bernie Sanders. After the election, change your voting status to unaffiliated. Let me ask you a question, have you ever received money back from the Republicans or the Democrats? Just over the last 2 days, I have received over 47 donation requests from both parties. Do not follow a party and make the politicians beg for your vote. The hardworking ones will get out there and show you why they need your vote. Do not be the Democratic sheep we have had in my state for all these years and see no progress. They want you to be complacent. Take charge of your families future. Show them the power you have. Make the politicians that think making money off of us is going to be easy and we will not hold them accountable to the promises they make. Let them know it will take hard work and dedication. Most of all, they will not be able to take advantage of the American People.
9 | Connie Plaisance Sarvis | 9 | 1344680075628241_1344708032292112 | FBI still investigating the foundation..don't let them fool you on polls either!  so we calling all pissed democrats, independents, and republicans, lets all get out and vote...pull the plug tomorrow and ''drain the swamp''. they coming out with all new lies today on Trump...don't believe any of it! corruption at its finest!
10 | Mindy Pye | 0 | 1344680075628241_1344838335612415 | Wow, so many people just don't get it. We now have proof that active FBI agents have been targeting a presidential candidate and releasing classified, confidential info to the other candidate in order to influence an national election. For conservatives out there - just imagine that the FBI was targeting Trump in favor of Clinton! Your heads would be exploding!
11 | Sean Allen | 4 | 1344680075628241_1344784635617785 | The Clinton corruption is astounding, even more astounding is the blind support of her uneducated followers that lack the common sense and basic intelligence to hold the criminal Hillary responsible for her actions. Its disgusting how Democrats have fully embraced pedophiles, liars, and criminals of all types now days.
12 | Patricia Cook | 2 | 1344680075628241_1344704348959147 | Eileen Tharp, Trump and some of the people who work for him is CORRUPT. Who are you guys calling yourself we the people, you must be people who want to be superior over everybody and want life to be like it  was way back when. Eileen, you guys calling yourself  we the people need to know life will not go back to the way you all want it. HILLARY supporters make your voices heard loud and strong tomorrow at the ballot box, so these so call we the people who do not include all people know they cannot win. God loves everybody and we all will answer to Him.
13 | Ken Myers | 3 | 1344680075628241_1344689572293958 | We need a cleaned out FBI. They are never allowed an opinion politically. When they become political they become the Gestapo, or the SS. The basis of our government is that there are certain pillars that can not be political. That insures the freedoms we enjoy. We need to go to sleep knowing the FBI, the Armed Forces, and it would be nice if the judicial system of lifetime appointments were above politics.
14 | Marion Rohling | 1 | 1344680075628241_1344743455621903 | THIS is what trump would call " rigged" . But hey, it's just us, the sheepish Democrats....they can be messed with, obstructed, smeared & hacked!!! We WILL RISE!
15 | Alan Pearlman | 0 | 1344680075628241_1345028338926748 | I tuned in MSNBC to hear the latest news about the election and I was delighted to see Katy Tur anchoring the Live With Thomas Roberts program.  She spoke eloquently, handled her guests masterfully, managed the screen changes expertly, and enthusiastically transitioned from MSNBC Promotional Announcements to commercials. Katy Tur has always been one of the best reporters out in the field, but now I am looking forward to seeing her grace the studio more often.
16 | Jon Persons | 0 | 1344680075628241_1344759662286949 | Podesta can go play in traffic. Coincidentally, that is what would happen if he ever became a serious threat to the Clinton powerbase.People can say that the Clintons are not corrupt because they have not been convicted of anything, but you have to remember that Al Capone was not convicted until the IRS went after him.
17 | Thea Limon | 1 | 1344680075628241_1344872795608969 | "I never heard that. I thought Vince Foster was the only person the Clinton's killed. How naive I was." After Wikileaks dropped more emails today that included this one, unknown sources shut down their website and Twitter stopped trending #DNCleaks2.
18 | Kelly Johnson | 1 | 1344680075628241_1344789108950671 | Voters are blinded by their hate of trump. Less than a week ago, FBI stated that there was no way to know the out come of 650,000 emails before the election. Days later they've made a discussion? Facts and common sense have been lost in the process. Example. 2001 bill clinton gave a pardon to international fugitive Marc Rich. This was done days after his ex wife donated to the DNC, the new clinton libary, and to the campaign of Hillary for her senator campaign. This is how the clintons operate. Congress knows it, American voters know it. And now a Clinton wants voters to give her the Oval Office again. Favors are owed to other countries for donations to her foundation which were either highly questionable or illegal. 20% of America's uranium now belongs to Russia who has rebuilt their nuclear arsenal. I ask voters why she didn't give news conferences for 250+ days then started to after the first debate. But hasn't even tried to give one since sept. 21st. Remember, making a statement and not taking questions isn't a true media conference. Stand in front of your ballot and actually think. What kind of a country votes corruption into the highest office. Don't like trump? Fine, keep your daughters and wives away from him. But with Hillary can you hide your wallet or what little savings you have?
19 | Steve Houghtaling | 0 | 1344680075628241_1344962608933321 | What matters is that America has the Constitution and the rule of law!!! If the law or Constitution is broke then their MUST be accountability to the crime by whoever commits it!!! But if some people are above the law, then we DO NOT have a Constitutional Government ruled by laws, then all we have is Tyranny!!!
20 | Peggy Gilkey | 0 | 1344680075628241_1344914102271505 | People keep talking about how many thousands of emails the FBI had to go through, excuse me if I am wrong but I thought they were only going through the ones from the time she became Secretary of State until she left. If so that cut down the emails quite a bit.
21 | Don Smith | 2 | 1344680075628241_1344720842290831 | Indeed, this should be investigated and the guilty subjects punished.But not only will you never end the leaks, this isn't about the FBI's conduct.  We wouldn't be having this conversation had Clinton not thumbed her nose at federal regulations and compromised national security.If she had any scruples she would have not made her bid for president.  But her lies and lack of shame support her egregious motives.

24 | Robert A. Murray | 0 | 1344680075628241_1345026578926924 | NO...your candidate's decision to lie about her server, cheat the American government out of over 30,000 official e-mails and attempt to steal the election was a mistake!
25 | Mike Conway | 1 | 1344680075628241_1344835238946058 | As the USA dies in front of us, helpless to do a thing because of the iron fist of corrupted power silencing what is good, moral and right.  The rule of law and the constitution.  The realization that this government is more corrupt than I already knew it to be...makes me feel and realize how helpless and hopeless we all are when confronted with this level of evil, power and corruption that is this government and that corrupt evil woman.

3 | Dixie Turner | 31 | 1344638252299090_1344747555621493 | Thinking seriously about cancelling my FB account since a person's death can draw so much hate not for the person who died but for other people. What has happened to the people in this country? You cannot blame this type of disrespect on anyone but yourselves. No political candidate can make anyone act one way or the other. That is the true personality of the ones showing the disrespect. No wonder there is so much unrest in our country. A lot of people have forgotten how to have compassion for others and have forgotten how to care for anyone other than themselves. This is not what we stand for and it certainly not what so many have fought and died for. Look at your families and ask yourself if you want this type of disrespect shown when you die?  RIP Janet Reno

6 | Christopher L Gilbert | 9 | 1344638252299090_1344670792295836 | That was then, this is now ...Janet Reno was Bill Clinton‚Äôs third pick for attorney general. He had promised to nominate a woman for the post, but his first two choices ‚Äì corporate lawyer Zoe Baird and New York federal Judge Kimba Wood ‚Äì withdrew following allegations they hired illegal immigrants as nannies.Today, not only would the candidate with an illegal maid not be hindered in her search for office, but the maid could handle classified documents, too!Today, our President could hire an illegal immigrant FOR Attorney General, and the press would attack anyone who questioned the legality of that.That truly was then, this really is now.
7 | Fay Lyn Mowry | 11 | 1344638252299090_1344666125629636 | I wish MSNBC would combine their coverage of Ms. Reno's passing with her passion for our Native Americans and honor her with some on the ground reporting at Standing Rock.

8 | Robert R. Ferguson | 1 | 1344638252299090_1345100555586193 | To: Critics and the Right Wing, Conservatives, the Religious Right, and Trump supporters. She was a highly intelligent woman who worked all of her adult life in public service; not to accumulate wealth but elevate and protect women, minorities, children and those less fortunate. Some of her decisions, you are free to disagree with, and you can also disagree with her political affiliations -- she was a life long Democrat but she was an honorable person dedicated to public service. I hope her life, and work, will inspire young women to stand up and fight for the right things in America. I hope young people will also be inspired to see that they can, too, make a difference in Democracy. Let's stop playing politics and start respecting things that matter like Janet Reno's life.
9 | Christopher L Gilbert | 1 | 1344638252299090_1344670302295885 | When the Founders finished their work on the Constitution, a woman asked, ‚ÄúWell, Doctor, what have we got‚Äîa Republic or a Monarchy?‚Äù Benjamin Franklin replied --- "A Republic, if you can keep it."Franklin could say of this election --- "I knew not when the day would come, but the day of reckoning for our Republic was inevitable...and I fear that day is upon us. Tomorrow, the American voters will decide whether they wish to preserve the Republic for which so many have sacrificed so much, or relinquish their God - given freedoms to a group of self-coronated elites...a modern day monarchy.

11 | Donna Silverman | 0 | 1344638252299090_1345031135593135 | I was watching MSNBC awaiting the President's speech, and you allowed his speech to go on without stopping Dana Bash and the other woman from talking.  It was very annoying that you did not show any respect to President Obama last night.  So, I switched to CNN, and they did not play his speech from the start either....very bad and annoying.  You need to give Hillary Clinton far more coverage.  All you do is follow Trump's evil campaign far too much.  It is time that you concentrated much more on the most qualified candidate in history as she deserves to become the first female 45th president of the USA.  Many of your viewers have expressed the same frustration with your politics which is wishy washy.  You should all be concentrating on supporting all the Democratic candidates, as an alternative to the evil Fox news negative propaganda.  I find your news commentators one day for Hillary, and the next day, they seem to gravitate towards Trump the demagogue.

13 | Lloyd Hart | 11 | 1344638252299090_1344656368963945 | Janet Reno is the person most responsible for all the death and destruction the US has inflicted on the world in the last 16 years with it's phony "War On Terror". As US Attorney General, she didn't lift a finger to investigate the theft of election 2000 and the subsequent suborning of the US Supreme Court by the Bush Campaign because the Clintons bribed and blackmailed her off the case.

The interviewer proposed a radical and illegal action, which the President had a duty to condemn.The President must immediately issue a statement to make crystal clear that only citizens of the United States have the right to vote, and that any noncitizen who votes, and anyone who assists noncitizens to vote, does so illegally and is subject to prosecution.

22 | Sleister Michael | 5 | 1344638252299090_1344690438960538 | PEOPLE LISTEN UP.If you vote for Hillary you vote for 100% more corruption in our government.Don't you think it is time to end it?Maybe Trump isn't the best pick, but at least we stand a chance to end part of the corruption, and if Trump doesn't do well we can find someone better in 4 years.But with Hillary she will get us in a war with Russia and chins the first year she is in office. Hillary has already stated she wants a war with Russia here at home to build her regime so she can control all.
23 | Franklin Strum | 3 | 1344638252299090_1344745638955018 | The Republic will fall after this election. Hillary will become sole authority and leader of the US. Congress will yield no power. The Courts will rule Hillary's executive orders Constitutional. Her decrees will make state rights no longer exist. I hope people who put Hillary in office especially Republicans are happy. First step go for the guns. As Hillary said she will reverse the Heller decision and make us like Australia

2 | Jamie Kasper | 92 | 1344634998966082_1344638858965696 | I figured it out...most uneducated men who love trump also support and like sexual assualt, rape and the kkk and many of the uneducated women who are voting for trump are either delusional in denial , ignorant, or a battered wife of a trump fanatic!
3 | Joseph Szarwark | 34 | 1344634998966082_1344644185631830 | LOL! FBI review over, no charges. Can we finally admit some Republicans don't know what the he'll they're talking about. So wrong so many times. That kind of a track record usually eliminates all credibility.
4 | Rick Watson | 19 | 1344634998966082_1344655042297411 | I heard a Trump supporter when asked about the number of events he has done over the last few days claim, "well you know he never sleeps". I know when I was able to stay away for a long time back when I was much younger it wasn't "stamina", it was good cocaine.

I tell you when, when the American people said that it was ok for the President of The U.S.A. ( Bill Clinton)to have sex with an intern in the Whitehouse while on duty, when the people said it was ok for the President ( Bill Clinton) to rape a woman, to expose himself to another and to sexually assault two others. When the people said it was ok for his wife (Hillary Clinton) to send Private investigators to dig up dirt and threaten these women.   When the people Reelected Bill Clinton and Elected Hillary Clinton as senator.

12 | Janice LeTourneau | 2 | 1344634998966082_1344759918953590 | Government has proved that the Clintons are above the law. They can do anything they wish - anything - and it is okay. Pay for play, fraud, corruption or breaking our National Security laws are all okay for them to break. So, it must be okay for anyone to break the laws of our country. After all, there is no double standard that would apply to just the Clintons - is there?
13 | Nick Hughes | 9 | 1344634998966082_1344642512298664 | Haha msnbc and CNN going down. Breaking news on how they rigging trumps interviews and debates from both networks. I knew it but everyone thats watching them will never see it because no way will they expose themselves. And in your face to the one's putting down fox news because I was right and now you can put that in your liberal pipe and smoke it. And they are a reason for the FBI not bringing charges right now and it's a hell of a lot better the way they are going to do it. And it will also finally convince the hillary nuts she is guilty of all and even more. So good by msnbc and CNN and the entire  Clinton family along with the dnc and some of the Democrat party for it will good people from within your own party working with the Republican party  that finally takes the corruption out of our government on both sides and the corrupt main stream media. So back to fox for the real truth and the bombshells they are about to drop that everyone around the world have been waiting for this whole election and fixing to get to see it.

18 | Peter H Brouillard | 1 | 1344634998966082_1344708898958692 | We can fix this problem on Tuesday and in the future. Just do not vote for Hillary. If you do not like him, do not vote for Trump. Vote for the other 2 candidates or write in Bernie Sanders. After the election, change your voting status to unaffiliated. Let me ask you a question, have you ever received money back from the Republicans or the Democrats? Just over the last 2 days, I have received over 47 donation requests from both parties. Do not follow a party and make the politicians beg for your vote. The hardworking ones will get out there and show you why they need your vote. Do not be the Democratic sheep we have had in my state for all these years and see no progress. They want you to be complacent. Take charge of your families future. Show them the power you have. Make the politicians that think making money off of us is going to be easy and we will not hold them accountable to the promises they make. Let them know it will take hard work and dedication. Most of all, they will not be able to take advantage of the American People.

You don't need the FBI to make a decision just look at the emails and see the disregard for not only the law but for common voter. That is just sad that she has no respect for the American way of life or for the people she was supposed to representing. Justice at the polls and rain on the Hillary coronation and disrupt the corruption. Stand up as one voice against Hillary and the corruption of the ruling elite.
20 | Mae Swope | 0 | 1344634998966082_1345043765591872 | I hate Biden is talking to popular voters when he knows every state law that only the electoral voters decide the President of the USA w/electoral voters. He even doesn't pay a dime out of his $230,700 paycheck. Huh? No way! Oh well u people think this is normal. so he does it. It only takes 270 people to legally, lawfully decide the Presdient of the USA. Not the rest of u voters.
21 | Cathy Politte Stahlman | 0 | 1344634998966082_1344966978932884 | The New York Times reported that aides to Bill Clinton started a Canadian charity which essentially shielded the identities of donors to his foundation. Bill did this even though Hillary had signed a pledge of transparency when she started her position as Secretary of State, as per Breitbart. This action covered up who donated $20 million to $33 million!
22 | Todd Dorsey | 0 | 1344634998966082_1344958758933706 | For those of you who still haven't voted yet the because you haven't had a chance or because you don't know who to vote for it's pretty simple. Are you happy with the way things have gone the last eight years are you happy with our economy, our  standing in the world , with the unemployment,  the way our vets have been treated, our 20 trillion in debt, high tuition costs, giving Iran billions, giving 50% of our uranium to putin, etc. If you're happy with all those things then the choice is clear then you should vote for Hillary because you cannot blame anything on trump. He as not been in office. Hillary's hands are all over all of the decisions that have been made in the last 8 years.
23 | Debbie Hoover | 0 | 1344634998966082_1345000175596231 | Vote Trump on Tuesday, so we don't have to have someone in the White House who will lie, cheat, steal to get what she wants. You have no choice but to vote for Trump if you want a better America!!

25 | Louis Romero | 3 | 1344634998966082_1344700418959540 | Get ready Trump supporters, your bubbles are going to burst in 2 days when Hillary becomes president. The rest of the world is going to be enjoying every second of your temper tantrums and cries that the election is rigged.

Hillary Clinton brought out Beyonc√©, Katy Perry and Jay Z on the campaign trail, so in Michigan on Saturday, Donald Trump released the big gun of conservative celebrity endorsements.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jon Altbergs | 1505 | 1344590818970500_1344593122303603 | Wasn't Trump calling HRC disgusting for her links to "pedophile" Anthony Weiner, yet here he is on stage with pedophile Ted Nugent.
2 | Steph Bynum | 1391 | 1344590818970500_1344593278970254 | Didn't Trump say Hillary having "celebrities" at rallies was a sign of weakness? Me thinks he's upset because he can't get better celebrities. What a sad, jealous little man.
3 | Dama Arauz | 505 | 1344590818970500_1344594892303426 | While Trump was denying people of color apartments Hillary straight out of college worked in the south to desegregate the schools and was a lawyer for disabled children to have the right to attend schools. If your child is on the SCHIP program that provides heath care to millions of children you have Hillary Clinton to thank for that. Hillary is the logical choice.
4 | Rich Wilfong | 349 | 1344590818970500_1344596092303306 | Draft avoiders stick together. Ted Nugent is an offense to everyone. He is just a has been dirt bag trying to hang on to any past relevance he once had. He is pathetic, sociopathic and not worth the time to consider his opinion.
5 | Jennifer Veros | 407 | 1344590818970500_1344592475637001 | Oh yea. This guy totally shuts down a Beyonc√© and JayZ appearance and performance. ::sarcasm::
6 | Virginia McCoy | 252 | 1344590818970500_1344610788968503 | He can have Chachi and Nutty Nugent. I'll take Stevie Wonder,Lady Gaga, LeBron James, Katy Perry, Michelle Obama, Oprah, Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, Natalie Maines. ..... and the list goes on. #itsover. #strongertogether!
7 | Anthony Canty | 261 | 1344590818970500_1344600688969513 | Nugent, a pants-shitting draft dodger campaigning for Trump, a draft dodger who complained of bone spurs when it was his turn to pick-up a rifle and lead a patrol in Vietnam.
8 | Tommy Ivors | 215 | 1344590818970500_1344597118969870 | So, this animal killing big mouth scumbag is the best Trump could do? Nugent proudly announced that he was going deer hunting right after his crotch grabbing appearance. Such low class ..
9 | Janay King | 153 | 1344590818970500_1344593768970205 | As we run into this final stretch in the 2016 vote, I wanted to make a post that helps to keep people on target since this is such an important election. Let‚Äôs think about the recent Brexit vote that is forcing the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, for a moment. In that vote, people made a protest vote against staying in the Union because they didn‚Äôt think that it would really happen. The Result, many Millennial Voters desperately want to take their vote back, saying that they were not being serious. In the 1980‚Äôs Carter was up by 8 points in the polls, people did not come out to vote because they thought that he had it beat. In the 2000 election, people were not thrilled about Al Gore, thinking that he was too much of a bore, and not a strong candidate. Many Liberals voted for Ralph Nader instead of Al Gore, and handed George Bush Jr. a razor thin victory that resulted in a disastrous 8 years. Listen People, I understand that it really looks like Hillary has this all sewn up. Trust me when I say that she doesn‚Äôt. It is not over until the last vote is counted.  She may not be your candidate that you are willing to stand on railroad tracks to get elected, she may not be your perfect choice for President, BUTIf history tells us anything, it is that we should never take anything for granted. This election needs to be won by Hillary Clinton. It is not enough to say that Hillary Needs to be President, but that she needs to win by such a huge margin so we never have to see Trump, or anyone like Trump, on the ballot ever again. We need to retake Congress. We need to vote blue for all Congressmen and Senators so we can retake the House and Senate. We need to put a stop to this crazy Republican right wing insanity that has gripped our government for years because of blind racism and stupidity. Get out there, Vote, get your Friends and Family to vote. Stop the insanity!!!!
10 | John J. McGrath | 94 | 1344590818970500_1344603505635898 | Don't think this endorsement's gonna pull in independents, Hispanics and women. It's more likely to drive those groups to ABT! I think he's already got the white, deer hunter vote.
11 | SaChrissa Cole | 65 | 1344590818970500_1344607852302130 | Has-been Ted NugentWill blend in perfectlyWith all of the other Trump TroglodytesProof that evolution is taking its timeHigher brain functions are taken for granted
12 | Sheila Harris | 46 | 1344590818970500_556200904586375 | The air is hanging very heavy here in Michigan this morning....the presence of Trump and Nugent in one space has damaged our ozone layer and dropped IQs if you were in proximity of the two....please call hazmat.
13 | Alan R. Ausel | 43 | 1344590818970500_1344606135635635 | Ted the head of Capons of America likes to kill things that can't shoot back. He was a bit reluctant to shoot at the Viet Cong.
14 | James Anderson | 66 | 1344590818970500_1344612812301634 | Isn't this the same guy who said he was going to leave the country if Obama was elected... and then said he would commit suicide if he was re-elected? So obviously, he's just as honest as Trump is.
15 | Karen Falch | 50 | 1344590818970500_1344593615636887 | You left out James Taylor and Stevie Wonder. Trump called it cheating. Someone tell him respect is earned.
16 | Michael Howard | 31 | 1344590818970500_1344622235634025 | Trump is the poster boy for hypocrisy and Kellyanne Conway a Clinton hater from way back is the poster girl for hypocrisy. Trump is angry that people from all walks of life is coming to the stage to support Hillary Clinton. The Republican Politicians refused be seen on stage with Trump. And, Trump has to accept support from far right groups ( KKK, White Christian Americans and other hate groups) and people that's not accepted by the Republican party. Go Hillary clean this moron's clock and his spinning surrogates.
17 | Norman Doll | 29 | 1344590818970500_1344613748968207 | Lmao This is too priceless in so many ways. What a way to end this election season.June Trump says "we'll have all the biggest stars"August through November everyone from LeBron James and Beyonce to Springsteen and Bon Jovi appear with and for ClintonSame time period Trump gets Scott Baio and NugentTrump complains about foul mouthed Jay Z. Brings in foul mouthed Nugent. You can't make this stuff up. Lori Price Doll
18 | Latasha Wroten | 31 | 1344590818970500_1344617815634467 | Reading thru the comments...why does Trump and his idiotic supporters think all black Americans live in the inner city? Misinformed blind leading the blind. I say again If America elects the Orange Shag Rug were all going to hell with gasoline drawz on and Trump will have the nuclear codes to execute it.
19 | Ronald Shackelford | 32 | 1344590818970500_1344595068970075 | By having Ted Nugent join him, what was Trump trying to prove, that being a child rapist for stars is ok?
20 | Steven Eash-Sanford | 13 | 1344590818970500_1183281961752466 | Oh please, this dried up old has been.......maybe he should have Chichi along side them.....then we can talk about a powerhouse......blow hards and bullies......FYI.....Grew up near Ted and my sister knows him......I am originally from Hanover Michigan when Ted lived on Ludtington Road......some people just need to sit back and retire, play bridge and watch reruns of hee haw
21 | Raymond Patitucci | 29 | 1344590818970500_1344617108967871 | Nugent like trump sexually molested women so they make a good pair. Both are examples of the worst of male hood from the USA. They are both archaic and a throw back to an earlier type of male. Distgusting.
22 | Mathom Malcontent | 17 | 1344590818970500_1344632518966330 | This is what a flailing loser looks like just before he fails. Tomorrow will be a sweet sweet day.Not only will most of us be on the right side of history, we will be part of making it happen as well.
23 | Christine Marin | 19 | 1344590818970500_1676932785878668 | Pedophile and draft dodger....a guy who crapped in his pants and peed and crapped again to avoid being drafted & be sent to Vietnam, hooking up with a guy who got 5 draft deferments to avoid Vietnam.....two losers...two cowards...they can go f*** themselves...
24 | Jim Manns | 8 | 1344590818970500_1676919099213370 | The same woman that dresses provocative and promoted the "Black Patherns" at family half time show of a National Televised event, "the Super Bowl". Beyonce is polluting our youth. And Hilary is lying and killing our men and woman in uniform, the two worse  role models of the year. Let's talk about Mother Theresa at the playgrounds or better yet Snow White or Cinderella...
25 | Michele Mccoy-Willis | 5 | 1344590818970500_1106155082834767 | Trump lost it about Beyonce and Jay Z rallying for Hillary...he is really gone blow the top off when The Boss (Bruce Springsteen), Bon Jovi and others rock the rally for Hillary Clinton in Philly tonight.

Aware that she could be declared the president-elect in about 48 hours, Clinton seemed to get a head start on the national group therapy session.

She's not perfect and she's never pretended to be. She is the best choice in this election. She is going to be President! You already got our vote in Florida!! Go Hillary!!
4 | Christiann L. Klein | 69 | 1344391795657069_1344405678989014 | I am impressed by her genuineness and appropriate recognition of the enormous importance of this election, and the accompanying responsibility to permit and encourage respect and healing. Her tone is entirely right, and I am most assuredly with her. üíü
5 | John Erwin Steiger | 56 | 1344391795657069_1344393982323517 | All mainstream media has submitted their "Hillary Wins" article for Tuesday night to the Clinton campaign so they begin their new "mandate speech". It's all fixed, it's all corrupt, prepare for war in america.
6 | Jason Eades | 55 | 1344391795657069_1344392725656976 | It took FBI Director Comey's team 1.3 years to review 55,000 Clinton emails. They just took 9 days to clear through 650,000? The system is RIGGED folks. This is your last chance to get your country back. #TRUMP2016
7 | John Stevenson | 24 | 1344391795657069_1344402315656017 | Carter vs Reagan: the polls showed Carter at 47% and Reagan at 39% but Reagan won in a landslide in the General election. All of the poll's have her winning.....Give us a break
8 | Bry Russell | 21 | 1344391795657069_1344402132322702 | Perhaps we can tranq Trumpsters and relocate them to an abandoned island where they can grunt, pick each other's fur, posture, thump chests, fight, scream and screech, cry foul and treachery, screw, drink, drug, reproduce, and not read or think critically together on Trump Island, patent pending!? I know, so very mean, being mean to those who are hateful and racist, who haven't evolved yet...

Hillary has a plan that will require a collective effort but it is a fix for sustainability. Isn't that the person you want as your president?
10 | Tao Valentine | 2 | 1344391795657069_1104818786300447 | Logically I know this post is unlikely to change anyone's mind about this election, and that's okay because I believe in the democratic process. I suppose I'm writing this as much for me as I am in the hope that someone will read it and question the legacy they want to leave the next generation. For what feels like forever, I have been listening to, and watching, Trump: attack racial, gender and sexual equality; use violent rhetoric and hate speech; support white supremacists; make fun of people with disabilities; attack our veterans; boast about how wealth and fame offer him access to our bodies, with or without consent; challenge our democracy; talk about torturing and killing innocent people; and lie without remorse or recourse to the American people. I have had a particularly visceral response to him boasting about sexually assaulting women after popping a Tic Tac, and then watching 12 women bravely come forward to confront their attacker, only to be dismissed, threatened and ridiculed on the public stage. I cannot express how courageous I think these women are. It is much easier to stuff down the emotions that accompany being violated than it is to stand up and fight. It's easier to swallow the anger and wash it down with food, alcohol or drugs. I understand this intimately. We wonder as a country why so many young college men don't understand that when a woman says no, she means exactly that. We shake our heads when they are taken to court by their victims, slapped on the hand, and sent back to their communities to violate more women. If we want to understand why our country has become one that embraces rape culture, we don't have to look far; it's all around us. The Republican party has endorsed a man who embodies the dying breed of racist, misogynist white men who believe women are second class citizens, put here to satisfy their sexual desires. We have a responsibility to ourselves, our sons and daughters, our sisters and mothers, and our country's unwritten history, to stop this rebirth of our nation's hatred and inequality. Voting in this election is perhaps the most patriotic thing we can do at this moment in time. If the choice is between moving forward together, or moving backward divided, there really is no choice.
11 | Bert McCollum | 5 | 1344391795657069_1344624475633801 | Hillary, who WILL win tomorrow, recognizes that her number one priority will be to bring healing to our bitterly divided country- a far different priority than we would have seen from Donald Trump.
12 | Robert Crouch | 1 | 1344391795657069_1344662958963286 | What does it matter that we have laws,can prove instances of Federal voter fraud,etc if the Administration's Justice Department refuses to prosecute and indeed actively blocks attempts at prosecution. Sad times for America,
13 | Crystal Elston Davis | 3 | 1344391795657069_1104984339617225 | You Trump people are delusional. Trump is a danger to this country. He is interested in making money not treating the American with respect. He has no decency and you all are accusing Hillary of the same things he is doing and done. He talks filthy and does not respect women. You certainly must only watch Fox News and don't learn any facts. What a shame these insults and lies are out here. The email trash is over.
14 | Gayle Murrain | 6 | 1344391795657069_1344539638975618 | One thing that I love about people "You, talk on hear say".  Stop reading and listening to right wing BS If you want facts ask yourself the following..1) Why has the GOP, denied raising taxes or redoing the taxes on the top 2% since Regan?..2)Why have they gerrymander, voting districts across this country for the past 25 years?3)Why have the republican states denied you medical insurance?4)Why have the GOP, voted against raising  wages for every American? But raise their own???5) Why did they allow major companies to take their money and business out of the country over the past 25 years or more?Just a few simple little questions????Ask yourself why is it that when your make making more than 300k, the more loop holes you have????Shouldn't those who make less pay less and have more loop holes?????If you want change and fairness vote "DEMOCRAT"...
15 | Andrew Riley | 2 | 1344391795657069_1344417712321144 | Get it straight, when she wins from now till she's out of office it'll be 'impeach Hillary!' all day everyday. Hell I'm betting the memes have already started. Straight goods, in 2036 Chelsea/Malia will face the same ol' same.
16 | Joseph Szarwark | 3 | 1344391795657069_1344644322298483 | LOL! FBI review over, no charges. Can we finally admit some Republicans don't know what the hell they're talking about. So wrong so many times. That kind of a track record usually eliminates all credibility.
17 | Ryan Calabrese | 2 | 1344391795657069_1344672985628950 | I'm just sad I'm going to have to look at that face, and hear that witchy voice, for the next 4 years. I'll have to shut off the TV anytime she is on, and truly no longer care about anything that goes on in American politics, just so I don't have to see that face, or hear that banshee yell
18 | Andrew Buck | 5 | 1344391795657069_1344434222319493 | Hillary takes tens of millions from middle eastern countries that kill/beat women and gays by government decree, not to mention her foundation robbed Haiti of hundreds of millions after the earthquake which resulted in thousands of poor black Haitians dying! THIS DEMOCRAT will be voting for JILL STEIN.
19 | Richard Parker | 3 | 1344391795657069_1344517028977879 | Half of Americans knows she's a criminal that shouldn't even have been able to legally have been on the ballot.And she thinks she can unite us?
20 | Robert A. Murray | 2 | 1344391795657069_1344507062312209 | Unfortunately...she is the psychosis the nation is suffering from!! She has hallucinations of competence and delusions of grandeur!
21 | Bob Sufentes | 6 | 1344391795657069_1344395282323387 | So then, it's as it was. As Secretary of State she was extremely careless with national security on emails that were bleached from a private server. It's akin to the murderer who everyone knows did it, but the gun can't be found. "Sir, without physical evidence of the murder weapon, you're free to go".
22 | Christina Tetlow | 3 | 1344391795657069_1344510538978528 | Hey Morning Joe, I seem to remember back after the 2012 election, you chastised the Republican party for ignorring the Hispanic vote. Well, guess what, they didn't listen. Are you seeing the numbers yesterday of Hispanic voters, showing up to vote. I have a problem with poll numbers. This is crystal ball or Palm reader theories. Watch what happens tomorrow and then tell me I am wrong. I love you and Mika, but was sick of this email crap. I was suspicious at the start and your Ignorance of Giuliani bagging about a Big surprise, days before Comey's letter. There was a big stink going on. And you ignore the Breitbart effect in Trump's campaign. There are certainly a lot of major culprits in that group. Oh and isn't that book a red flag for the FBI?  Breitbart supporter wrote it, right?  Media do your job!  Then you ignore the many lawsuits that Trump is facing, and not just the harassment suits. I am SICK of the emails. Move on.
23 | Joey Balz | 1 | 1344391795657069_1104907199624939 | Lol bridge building!! She's hated by sane people. She's pandered to blacks Muslims and illegals. She's called all white peoples racist. No bridges to be built here. If she wins. She will merely start her illegal activity unchecked. It's what she does. Lie, cheat, steal
24 | Scott Nadell | 1 | 1344391795657069_1344551245641124 | Tensions spike because this country has a huge problem. It's no different than it was on the eve of the Civil War. Deeply divided. Back in 1860 it was about Slavery. Cheap labor for Southern plantation owners. Operate a business by owning human beings.Today, it's still about Southern society, cheap manufacturing jobs lost to the Far East, the landscape of America changing not to the liking of White Caucasians, race, and naturally the interpretation of Christian Family values.Just look at a map. A nation deeply divided. We might not have a traditional Civil War with guns, but we now fight by allowing our Federal Government to fall into disarray. Republicans now use Obstruction vs Compromise. Republicans  try to alter voter suppression  of minorities. American people love to complain. Half don't vote, apathy. The other half keep voting the same Losers back into office.So now we have a nation where half of us want to move forward and keep evolving and half want to go backwards. Go back to when Whites had the power and life was country simple.If history tells you anything, you can't go backwards or stay the same. You can only move forward.America will vote on Tuesday and the judgment of the American people will certainly be challenged.
25 | Everett Clifford | 2 | 1344391795657069_1344495722313343 | She was involved with voting fraud against Bernie Sanders, along with the Democratic party and Deb Schultz, that is just one of her many many atrocities that she has committed, if the American people are so ignorant to vote for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump , You get what you deserve,

Trump sounded a familiar refrain after learning the latest from the FBI: The system's rigged.

1 | Lise Melin | 523 | 1344313052331610_1344315085664740 | Hillary said it the day Comey unlawfully injected himself in the election: There's nothing there. She's pretty much been saying the same thing for 30 years, and Republicans have fished once again without success!DON'T BOO, VOTE!
2 | Maryjo Hetro | 337 | 1344313052331610_1344315935664655 | Just go away...we are tired of your comments...when he thinks he is winning everything is fine...when he thinks he is losing the system is rigged...can you imagine this nut case running this country....he is one big joke!!!
3 | Chris Finch | 203 | 1344313052331610_1344314478998134 | Lol....pathetic.The good thing though, is no one is left that can't see though his ridiculousness....Other than the deplorables, and they don't count.
4 | Frank Ramirez | 107 | 1344313052331610_1344317145664534 | He has nothing, that's what happened, he's angry and pissed that Giuliani wasn't able to win the game for him. You see, Trump is a coward, he operates in the shadows and has no backbone, Giuliani was his go to. It didn't work out too well
5 | Deda Richardson | 76 | 1344313052331610_1344316752331240 | He is a psychological nightmare. He has such bizarre control over people who are running from false information. People don't research enough to know that she's not the first to be involved in loss of life for our Country and she will not be the last. These people sign on knowing that they could lose their lives. He should be a hypnotist instead!
6 | Kerry Senchyna | 100 | 1344313052331610_1344321818997400 | Don't let up Dems. No matter what the polls show. Don't get complacent. Show this combination of Homer Simpson and Adolf Hitler that there is a blue tidal wave about to crash down on him.
7 | Ceil Sheehan | 74 | 1344313052331610_1344324708997111 | I could accept their logic if one person was reading and deciphering 650,000 emails. However, the FBI has thousands of researchers, sophisticated computer programs and programmers. I'm surprised it took 8 days. Trumpites get ready for a downfall come Tuesday night!üá∫üá∏üíôüá∫üá∏üíôüá∫üá∏üíô
8 | Adam Buky | 66 | 1344313052331610_1344322422330673 | He was cheering the FBI on when they wanted to review the new emails which were mostly duplicate and now that he doesn't like the results... it's all of a sudden rigged again.

10 | Sam T. Abraham | 31 | 1344313052331610_1344326085663640 | He's like a five-year-old child. He doesn't accept anything that doesn't go his way. He pouts and whines and thinks life isn't fair if he doesn't always get his way. The man is pathetic.
11 | Amy Yavelak-Czyz | 27 | 1344313052331610_1344335292329386 | Unfit for president. Does not accept conclusions that do not support false narrative and right wing conspiracy theories. To suggest a rigged system devoid of fact, ignoring the five year character assassination anti Clinton witch hunt, is unfathomable. Trump is a disgraceful buffoon. Clinton has not been granted due process and her constitutional right to innocence until proven guilty by the GOP, GOP congress, trump and conservatives. Don't tell us how you love the constitution and continue to crucify her character, you're all full of crap.
12 | Devin Smith | 24 | 1344313052331610_1344323278997254 | The irony is that HRC is accused of secret collusion with people in and out of government including foriegn governments.  Yet upon closer inspection it is Trump that has always and continues to have secret collusion with people in and out of government including foriegn governments.  And he knows his tax returns would show it.  As much heat as he takes he has correctly calculated that he can remain shrouded in secrets ranting about the tiny amount that is not known about HRC.  And people are falling for it!
13 | Anu Banu | 35 | 1344313052331610_1344318042331111 | The world is watching us. Let us create history now and elect Madam President. So much is at stake. Please go out and vote for Hillary Clinton on Nov 8th. The other candidate is a mad devil running loose. Don't be complacent. Every single vote is significant.
14 | Annette Kessee | 7 | 1344313052331610_1344463592316556 | Dems, we've gotta show up in huuuuge numbers because there's no telling how many votes Hillary lost behind that bs FBI investigation. People were early voting for 9 days before this idiot came out with the news yesterday about the emails not revealing anything new.He should resign immediately! We must stay the course, stand in line for as long as it takes, and vote BLUE.
15 | Lynda Klem | 8 | 1344313052331610_1344334928996089 | I am so sick of hearing this is rigged, that is rigged.....If people don't like the outcome to something they deal the 'rigged' card.  And in some cases there's a bit of paranoia mixed in,
16 | M E MBeth Elliott | 17 | 1344313052331610_1344337678995814 | Trump needs to worry more about what has come out about him, and his wife Melania. He bribed a public official, stole money from a charity, tax evasion,ties with Russia, illegally doing business with Cuba, and his wife has immigration problems. I'm sure there's some I missed, or haven't leaked out yet.
17 | Paul Dombrowski | 19 | 1344313052331610_1344327398996842 | So, just last week the King of wussies was praising Comey, and today the crybaby whines about it? Hey righties, how come your orange fuhrer goes through so many mood swings?   Is it drugs or menopause?
18 | Kerry Senchyna | 12 | 1344313052331610_1344378572325058 | If the media is rigged mr. drumpf, then why did many hard right conservative newspapers who have always endorsed the republican candidate for almost 100 years did NOT endorse you? New Hampshire Union Leader, Arizona Republic, The Dallas Morning News, Cincinnati Enquirer, Detroit News. Are they all in on the massive global conspiracy to keep you out of the White House? Or are they so disgusted with you as a human being that they can't bring themselves to endorse you? Only someone with as toxic and vile views about the world would cause them to do this, not a massive conspiracy. You sir are delusional.
19 | Jason Miller | 4 | 1344313052331610_1344322665663982 | Everyone that isn't voting for Hillary doubts it. And they should. She should have been indicted. Plain and simple. Anyone else would and has been indicted for what she did. The DOJ blocked this. Period. Some has their boot on comey's neck. 650k emails in 8 days???? Hahahaha there litterally isn't enough time in the day to read each one.
20 | Elizabeth Taylor | 0 | 1344313052331610_1351578204860761 | Last night on 60 Minutes this guy said he felt like a child of parents who were getting a acrimonious divorce when it came to this election. Maybe we need to place them in court appointed arbitration and rerun the election.
21 | Francis Antobre | 7 | 1344313052331610_1344367385659510 | Right wings have a disease called  deplorable. They believe stupid conspiracies. How will any sane person support Trump? The guy is liberal to the core, oh I forgot he said Republicans are the most stupid. They will believe anything.
22 | Musa Kayode Sindy | 9 | 1344313052331610_1344324152330500 | Canadians love Americans and we like to see blue all the way. Congratulation Madam President!You have been vindicated yet again. This fighter has been unfairly treated about a matter she had apologized many times.
23 | Roofus Ray | 4 | 1344313052331610_1344319352330980 | You ppl don't hear to good. Did Comey say . The yr long Clinton foundation investigation is still ongoing ? The IRS is still investigating her also..no you didnt. But they are and that had nothing to do with Trump or deplorables.
24 | Chloe James | 12 | 1344313052331610_1344313818998200 | She's still under a separate criminal investigation by the FBI for her pay to play scandals. And they haven't yet begun the investigation for perjury, which we all know she's guilty of! I'm so over this woman!
25 | Emmit Penny | 1 | 1344313052331610_1344453088984273 | I can't wait till November 9th when Trump refuses to pay everyone and sues the lot for his loss. The FBI still maintains that there has been no wrong doing on the part of Sectary Clinton. The FBI says they still won't be filing charges. Of course Hillary rigged the whole thing!!! üòäüòäüòä

There is going to be a winner, either Trump or Hillary! Deal with that reality! Do you want to live in a country lead by a buffoon like Trump, or do you want someone with a proven record of public service and worldwide respect! Stop being spoiled, sore losers and THINK! Vote! Go Hillary! Go Democrats across the country!!
2 | Joe Marsilio | 56 | 1344282502334665_1344292482333667 | Vote swapping should be illegal. Voting on behalf of another person, not to mention if they don't reside in the jurisdiction where the vote takes place, is illegal.
3 | Patricia Marie Diienno | 31 | 1344282502334665_1344290379000544 | Stein will never win, but worse yet, if Trump wins, Stein will be hated & branded.  On that account alone, I would never vote for someone that stupid. Imagine how badly they could screw up everything else in the country.

She spoke eloquently, handled her guests masterfully, managed the screen changes expertly, and enthusiastically transitioned from MSNBC Promotional Announcements to commercials. Katy Tur has always been one of the best reporters out in the field, but now I am looking forward to seeing her grace the studio more often.
7 | Dean Felix | 0 | 1344282502334665_1345134845582764 | For those of you who wonder why so many of us are voting for Trump- I think this sums it up pretty good! For What It's Worth Department:                                        The Media just doesn‚Äôt get it....they can't believe that people are so angry     that they can no longer be manipulated!  Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes, he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phony pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and it's going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.
8 | Jason Rayborn | 1 | 1344282502334665_1344452655650983 | Hillary's father, Hugh Rodham, Sr., was reportedly a "fixer" and "bagman" for banks and insurance companies, here and overseas. Her brothers have reportedly aligned themselves with business in the former Soviet Union, described by some as with the criminal oligarchs of the Russian mafiya and their laundry banks. In the Clinton administration, there was no effective scrutiny or restraint of the Russian criminals operating in U.S. big cities, like Chicago, Cleveland, and New York. America's secret political police, the FBI, the CIA, and the DEA, have been willfully blind. With impunity, dope from Southwest Red China floods into the U.S. through Chicago as a major intake point. According to law enforcement personnel, the Rodhams reportedly stem from links to the Gambino crime family in Scranton, Pennsylvania
9 | Militari Vernado | 14 | 1344282502334665_1344282609001321 | Hillary is a terrible candidate, but Trump lack the intellectual capacity. I wonder if the conservatives would have given a free pass to a person of color with a low vocabulary like Trump does. Trump is not a well spoken candidate and his vocabulary is limited. That's why he uses word like wall all the time  lol

Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ

All she has is her gender and she needs tricks to fool people into voting for her. Unfortunately, there are plenty fools out there to do so.
19 | Hannah Gibbs | 0 | 1344282502334665_1344627822300133 | The reason I don't like this idea is it will be used for evil for Trump supporters. They can easily claim to be a third party voter and "swap" with a Hillary Clinton voter and still go vote for Trump knowing they tricked a Hillary Clinton supporter into not voting for her. I'm not comfortable with this AT ALL.
20 | Debbie Hoover | 0 | 1344282502334665_1345000592262856 | Vote Trump on Tuesday, so we don't have to have someone in the White House who will lie, cheat, steal to get what she wants. You have no choice but to vote for Trump if you want a better America!!

Hillary supports Partial Birth Abortion even when full term. They will advance their cause on this. At any term this is still a baby. And on any day of the week it is still abortion more - correctly described... murder of innocents. Think about the murder of thesebabies before you cast your vote.  Also remember for those of you who carry a gun, if you vote for Hillary, you will have your guns taken away. It's not just scare tactics, it is a fact. And this country will sympathize Muslims, and persecute Christians. You are not voting in the first woman President, you are voting in a demon.

In the ad, Trump says he will defend Americans against "those who control the levers of power in Washington" and pledges to fight the "global power structure" and its promotion of "global special interests."

2 | Donna Mackintosh | 114 | 1344222529007329_1344227272340188 | Hope KellyAnne Conway got paid up front - cuz now that Trump is definitely going to lose, she's going to get blamed and get stiffed just like the campaign poll taking guy is getting stiffed for his $750,000
3 | Gabby Johnson | 53 | 1344222529007329_1344227729006809 | Trump will expose that the Rothschilds have 400 trillion dollars & secretly control the entire world, and no one is allowed to say it. If they did, the Men in Black would show up with their memory erasing light.

What is disturbing is that we live in a country where even one single person, never mind millions, believe a brainless, racist, egomaniacal sexual predator with the temperament of a middle school bully deserves your precious vote. We're at a point where if you vote for Trump you either endorse what he represents (I almost said "stands for" but he stands for NOTHING other than his insatiable narcissism) or you are ignorant of it. Which is it? I really want a Trump voter to tell me.
6 | Carrie Lalonde | 28 | 1344222529007329_1344284572334458 | I am an 89 year old Democrat and voted for Hillary via mail in ballot. I Think the Democrats should make it known that the voters can change their votes (as Trump did) now that Hilary has been absolved of any wrong doing. That hurt her I know. I watched the dinner party after the conventions and I thought Trump looked more like Melania's Father than her Husband. I think Trump is ugly both inside and out. Just saying!!!

Just like Hitler, he studied Hitlers speeches and agenda for years. The professional con man scares the living daylights out of me. The ultimate quest is for power over the US. Will that include the whole earth?
10 | Veto Villanova | 10 | 1344222529007329_1344234615672787 | The people in office who support him are part of the problem. They aren't going anywhere unless voted out of he wins. He'll only empower the politically corrupt structure he claims to be against.

12 | Craig Williams | 10 | 1344222529007329_1344257859003796 | trump is a traitor who goes on russian tv to trash his own govt. and military, encourages a foreign govt. to hack an american official ( conspiracy to commit espionage ) tries to do business with cuba during the embargo, brags that paying no taxes makes him smart, taxes he avoids which support and pay our soldiers, first responders, firemen and police he pretends to care about, loses a billion dollars in one year ( imagine what he would do to the economy) makes a casino go broke - how does that happen, a casino is suppose to have the advantage, his companies are based overseas to avoid american taxes, he buys materials from other countries to assemble his products in his overseas companies, he uses chinese steel, instead of american made steel, to build his buildings, he does not employ american workers in those companies, how can he make america great again when even HE won't invest in america?
13 | Laurie Lee | 6 | 1344222529007329_1344282692334646 | It is important that Donald Trump and the obstructionist, vindictive, necrophobic members of Congress are repudiated during this election, because we need to send a clear message that AMERICA DOES NOT STAND FOR BIGOTRY AND HATE.
14 | Keith Keybaby Lewis | 6 | 1344222529007329_1344280865668162 | And again her enemies investigated her and found nothing If the republicans have taught me anything, it's that Hillary is the most honest person to ever run for president. They have investigated her since 1992 at a taxpayer expense in the 100s of millions of dollars and found that she did nothing wrong.How many of her enemies could survive this and still run for president
15 | Julie Corcoran | 9 | 1344222529007329_1344237835672465 | He needs a few years in school learning law and government.  Just the basics would be an improvement.

17 | Chris Smith | 4 | 1344222529007329_1344255905670658 | This must be the only group he hasn't insulted yet. Just making sure he gets everyone in before tuesday.
18 | Patricia O. DeTreville | 2 | 1344222529007329_1344286289000953 | This could not possibly be UNintentional. Surely there is SOMEONE in the Trump campaign who knows something about history. One can hope. However, since this is a subtle and continuing them, it appears to be intending to appeal to the basest instincts, just as Trump has done all along.
19 | Anthony Byrd | 2 | 1344222529007329_1344304232332492 | This is the same bull that has been twisted over and over again. If Trump states someone is not doing a good job then race, gender, religion, and everything else gets brought into mix. Maybe the person just sucks at doing their job regardless of the other things. Oh no that's right we live in a PC world where no one is going to be accountable. It's someone else's fault or someone kept me down because of this, that, or the other.

22 | Michael Howard | 1 | 1344222529007329_1344642092298706 | Trump is playing to his hate groups and racists people that are supporting him with their money and time. Groups such as White Christian Americans, White Nationalist, KKK, Neo-Nazis, White supremacist, Alt-Right, Ex-Yahweh cult members and many others. Their racism combined with Trump racism make one big mess. We Americans must vote on Nov 8 and put a stop to this type of racist campaigning. Send a message this is not what America is about.

( Bill Clinton)to have sex with an intern in the Whitehouse while on duty, when the people said it was ok for the President ( Bill Clinton) to rape a woman, to expose himself to another and to sexually assault two others. When the people said it was ok for his wife (Hillary Clinton) to send Private investigators to dig up dirt and threaten these women.   When the people Reelected Bill Clinton and Elected Hillary Clinton as senator.

I think it's scary how many ppl believe his BULL & _ _ _t ......there goal is to start getting there ppl elected by the people who are in the category of being lied to continually and join the extreme right and further their cause....hopefully ppl wake up...That's how fascist and Nazism came to power....if ppl don't read or taught history of they are doomed to repeat it...

LETS WORK TOGETHER TO ELECT ONE OF THE MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATES EVER TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT! In just 1 DAY. 4 HOURS, voting will begin to elect our next president and candidates up and down the ballot When I say this race is close, that is an understatement. DONALD TRUMP could really win. Folks, EVERYTHING we have been fighting for these last 8 years (and before) is at stake: women's rights, equal pay, environmental protections, college affordability, immigration reform, tax reform, you name it. If you have been sitting on the sidelines or are apprehensive about supporting Hillary because she has her flaws, I urge you to consider getting out and voting for her. Take a step back from the sensationalism and look at her platform. Look at what she is aiming to do as president compared to Trump. Look at the tremendous work she has done for children and families throughout her career. This election is too consequential to sit out and we NEED YOU in order to win. After the election is over, we can work to push for a more progressive agenda but, if we sit back and let Trump win, any hope of that goes out the window...literally. If anyone wants to talk/has questions PLEASE feel free to reach out to me this weekend. Your vote is your voice. Make it heard on November 8th by casting a ballot for the most progressive, qualified candidate on the ballot.

He is so much more intelligent sounding, knowledgeable and credible as a presidential candidate than dingbat Gary Johnson. I have given a great deal respect to him. But I dont have much for GJ,.. the guy just comes off too whacky and NOT presidential material. The Libertarian party might have gained more respectability if he (Bill Weld) were the top of the ticket. I wish him well.
6 | Kim Banez | 101 | 10154060865969067_10154066051754067 | Ever notice how people who have directly worked with Clinton on both sides of the aisle, worked with her in business, in intelligence, in the military, all have good things to say about her? That no one who worked closely with Trump in business says good things about him?
7 | George Faust | 38 | 10154060865969067_10154066015174067 | They should've had Weld at the top of the ticket, he just seems much more rational than Johnson, I know he's been a lifelong republican, but she could probably use someone like him in her cabinet

12 | Angus Ramadeen | 10 | 10154060865969067_10154066302269067 | Hillary Clinton is an honest but she is not perfect because she is human. She is worthy of being out president because amongst the two candidate she is the best prepared. Mr. Trump does not have the experience or temperament for world affairs we cannot afford to take a chance in todays world we need a strong steady leader. Go Hillary! The republicans have spent 100's of millions of dollars trying to destroy Mrs. Clinton so obviously some of it has stuck.
13 | Betty Jean Perez | 4 | 10154060865969067_10154066089654067 | I was a democrat for 40 years and changed party to vote for Trump. The democratic party is not the same as the party of Kennedy. They worked for the working people and really cared. Now all they care about is themselves. The Republican party has changed to become the party of the working people. We are tired of seeing all the corruption that is going on in the administration of Obama. The Wikileaks emails and the FBI emails, has open many people eyes as to what is really going on.  Vote Trump for God and Country!!!!
14 | Terry Lee | 4 | 10154060865969067_10154065997479067 | These republicans say one thing ..but when they are in that voting booth I have no doubt they will vote for Trump...they don't want to lose their powers....
15 | Bryan Hunter | 4 | 10154060865969067_10154066230394067 | He realizes she may need some of their 3rd party votes to assure a victory. Kudos to former Gov. Weld for realizing that they don't in all reality have a chance in the election and are doing the right thing by endorsing Mrs. Clinton.
16 | Duke Slade | 8 | 10154060865969067_10154065986469067 | This is your moment. This is your time to take a stand. When your grandchildren speak of you they will recount that you stood for America. You did not surrender. You did not run away. You held strong for freedom and the Constitution. You defeated Hillary Clinton. You voted Trump. You ensured that America survived.

I tell you when, when the American people said that it was ok for the President of The U.S.A. ( Bill Clinton)to have sex with an intern in the Whitehouse while on duty, when the people said it was ok for the President ( Bill Clinton) to rape a woman, to expose himself to another and to sexually assault two others. When the people said it was ok for his wife (Hillary Clinton) to send Private investigators to dig up dirt and threaten these women.   When the people Reelected Bill Clinton and Elected Hillary Clinton as senator.
19 | Michelle Anderson | 1 | 10154060865969067_10154066159629067 | Give me a break. I am so sick of all the news channels  (msnbc included) biased opinions and outright campaigning for Hillary.. It does however show how terrified the media and the Politicians are of Trump winning. Life as they know it would be over. I don't like Trump per say but I am voting for him because career politicians have done nothing and made all the same promises since I was a child and nothings changed for the better.
20 | Amanda Cassel Hyde | 0 | 10154060865969067_10154066297749067 | The Emoluments Clause in the U.S. Constitution says that, ‚ÄúNo one, nor their spouse, can take money from foreigners.‚Äù Hillary Clinton has to be guilty of 70 or 100 counts just on that one charge! When will the media be honest about how much lawlessness the Clintons stand for and how much they have ripped off the American people? http://nbcnews.to/2eDxdQq
21 | Brenda Clark | 3 | 10154060865969067_10154066014659067 | Appalling that no democrat's spoke out against Hillary for putting national security at risk. Therefore due to my love of this country, my children, grandchildren and all Americans we voted red all the way. First time ever.
22 | Jerry Allsman | 6 | 10154060865969067_10154065992614067 | If Huma Abedin had transferred classified government emails belonging to Hillary Clinton and the State Dept. to Anthony Wiener's laptop, wouldn't that unquestionably be considered espionage?
23 | Vera Turner | 0 | 10154060865969067_553092444881499 | What's with the Native American electoral College Voter that is not voting for Hillary Clinton even if Washington State goes Democratic. He is willing to pay a fine so her opponent can get one more vote. He needs to know that her opponent in the 1970's said that CUSTER should have finished his job and we wouldn't have all these problems with the Indians. He wanted tax free casinos.
24 | James Ardito | 2 | 10154060865969067_10154066085274067 | They give Libertarianism a bad name. The last thing any actual self-respecting Libertarian would do is endorse a statist like Hillary.

1 | Krystal Perez | 334 | 1344131675683081_1344133435682905 | PERFECTION! haha. Plain & simple: We cannot let a racist, sexist, trash-talking, pathetic, inhumane Republican be the face and voice of our country.
2 | Kara Kiblinger | 227 | 1344131675683081_1344133112349604 | Wait til 2020, when all the Republicans running for President will try to distance themselves from Trump. Almost none of them can claim they didn't support him at one point or another.
3 | Man-El Garcia | 207 | 1344131675683081_1344132455683003 | I stopped replying to the trump supporters. I almost feel sorry for them, almost ...
4 | Francisco Galdamez | 116 | 1344131675683081_1344133989016183 | Donald Trump is a scumbag at its finest in quality. Lets be realistic here people. Donald talks about our economy . How jobs are flying overseas!well last time I checked he is one of  the types of business men he is describing .He has lots of businesses out of the U.S of A. To avoid taxes .He talks about how the system walks all over the little guy but wait a minute, he does step all over the little guy by sueing and pumping fear into contractors that try to collect the full amount of money for their honest hard work they provided.He talks about law and order. How can trump supporters block in their minds  all the sexual assualts that Donald trump has done in his lifetime? More than just one is true, thats all it takesTo know that this man should be in jail and registered as a SEX OFFENDER not registered as a PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE! A poor man gets accused he is jailed until proven innocent. A rich man gets accused he roaming free and is thought to be above the law!#NEVERTRUMP2016

6 | Ramon Cordero | 89 | 1344131675683081_1344135912349324 | So much for the so called emails scandal. Republicans were trying to find anything to see what sticks. Get over it. You got nothing on her now. She is a good person and will be your next president. Trump is a hateful, racist, arrogant, person and will never be our president. Americans want someone that represent our values. Trump does not live up to those values.

10 | Carlene Salvaggio | 26 | 1344131675683081_1344140212348894 | A great list of people Republican people however blue all the way for me only because Republicans want to keep their seats in the House and we need Democrats in the house in Congress to get things done with a Democratic president
11 | Keith Keybaby Lewis | 22 | 1344131675683081_1344151842347731 | And again her enemies investigated her and found nothing If the republicans have taught me anything, it's that Hillary is the most honest person to ever run for president. They have investigated her since 1992 at a taxpayer expense in the 100s of millions of dollars and found that she did nothing wrong.How many of her enemies could survive this and still run for president
12 | MJ Rich-Schmerberg | 18 | 1344131675683081_1344140342348881 | I don't care about who in the party is infighting. I'm more concerned about the people voting for him going  berserk if he doesn't win .....or going berserk if he does win. I thought Iowans were nice people. They didn't look so nice at his rallies. Neither do any of the wonderful Christian people at any of his meetings look nice or decent or the least bit fair minded.....  not if they think they can IMPOSE their religious beliefs on the rest of  us if he wins, and more frightening, him carrying out the multitude of threats he's made. The chants of "lock her up" alone were too close to the sounds made at a witch hunt. These people are complicit in that if they vote for him.

14 | Karen Chapman | 16 | 1344131675683081_1344140019015580 | Trump out whining becuz people who have been in very long lines waiting to vote weren't shut out since the polling hours had passed! He thinks their right to vote should end at a certain hour! What a dic tator in the making!

Now a qualified woman is about to be the first female commander in chief and my daughter, mother, sisters, friends, etc couldn't be happier! #Unity4Peaceüíô
16 | Mercedes Vaquero | 10 | 1344131675683081_1344147535681495 | "I don't know how else to say it. The head of the FBI trolled the entire country for the past week. He tipped the scales for a racist, misogynist, xenophobic, con man demagogue. How can we make him own this? A resignation isn't good enough. Can he be prosecuted?" (Diego S√°nchez)
17 | Marion Rohling | 12 | 1344131675683081_1344137142349201 | They say it now???All of them are cowards! Where was their opposition when it would have made a difference?
18 | Belinda Carver | 13 | 1344131675683081_1344142015682047 | This is the exact reason I'm voting Trump.  If the corrupt elite establishment in the Republican party aren't supporting him, then he's the man we need.  If they were behind him 100%, then it would be because he was bought just as they are.
19 | Marcus Napolian Smith | 19 | 1344131675683081_1344138789015703 | Trump is about to end up like Romney did back in November 2012 before the election.Wasting fuel traveling all over the country with no hope of winning and no support of major republicans.
20 | Mary Goff | 12 | 1344131675683081_1344138755682373 | We will never know how many so called Trump supporters will actually vote for HRC when alone in the polling booth. Probably a lot more than you might think.
21 | Kester Edward Lowers Jr | 1 | 1344131675683081_1847334162177868 | The republican party may not voice they are like Trump but they are in every way as every legislation and law shows racism and division of classed is created by them. The schools educational system is failing due to their ideas of schools being divided by class , and race. Wars to support another power player besides oil corporations is the weapons manufacturers . They just don't say it. They put it into law.
22 | Jeanne Brooks-Miller | 4 | 1344131675683081_1344159685680280 | Ramon Cordero....Wake up...Comey said the former SOS was careless, she lied to Congress and she allowed non security persons view classified emails. He, as FBI can do nothing on his end but Congress can now proceed with lying under oath and destroying evidence after Congressional Subpoena issued. Congress will go after her as they did Nixon.
23 | Michael French | 4 | 1344131675683081_1344153885680860 | it use to upset me reading people did not consider Obama as their president because they did not vote for him i never felt that way about any president but i do feel that way about hillary- i was never given s chance to vote i feel- so no if she is given the presidency she is not mine- i was not allowed to have a voice in that decision- period done- she bought it - and i was never asked how i felt - i did not count then i won't count later
24 | TomSandy Brown | 2 | 1344131675683081_1847289995515618 | I say BS on this it's is the left trying to sway your vote the Republicans are standing with trump. They are only few Republican that turned away and that because Trump is going to change the way they have worked for years. That would be the ones that were in it for them self not for the American people.
25 | Carrie Lalonde | 2 | 1344131675683081_1847330485511569 | I feel that Trump tells so many lies about so many things that concern Hillary's campaign. Tonight I heard that he was telling about all the bus loads of people coming to vote after hours in Nevada. Mr. Ralston had the real  information on that,.didn't happen. I wonder if his followers will be looking for the Kool Aid if Trump loses. God help us if he doesn't lose. He said what the FBI found on Weiners PC was criminal, worse than Water Gate. I thought that was a private Real Estate Deal. I am with Hillary. I have been voting Democrat for most of my 89 years. Not about to stop now.

5 | John Kelly | 16 | 725925144239180_727230764108618 | You could say what you want about Barack Obama but one thing you have to admit, is the man is intelligent and presidential. Why any single person in this country would want to elect a man who sounds like a junior high school kid and has the intelligence of a Jr. high school kid is beyond me.....way beyond. I keep wondering how much of the Donald Trump thing is actually a reaction to the audacity that we elected a black man as president. So many racist pricks out there, just couldn't handle that I guess.
6 | Lance Harbor | 5 | 725925144239180_727197844111910 | Tell the Trump operative on a few minutes ago you can easily search all 650k emails in a few days. There is this great new technology called software. Do a keyword search for only Clinton emails then read them. It could have been a few hundred. In fact I'm surprised it took this long.I know Trump supporters are uneducated. But, I did not realize it extended to campaign staffers.

And, you can be rest assured it won't be republican...
8 | Ken Goubeaux | 6 | 725925144239180_727188324112862 | After this election everybody should stop watching NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN & MSNBC ...if we hurt there rating it will cost them big money !!
9 | Jacqueline Davis | 1 | 725925144239180_727192324112462 | So true President Obama if you don't vote it's because you didn't want to and if you don't vote don't complain and if you think your vote don't count ask yourself why are they campaigning so hard to get your vote just go VOTE
10 | Chris Blankenship | 2 | 725925144239180_727438260754535 | The last time Hillary and Obama ran against each other, Obama said Hillary was not fit to be President and is an evil person. Now he thinks she is so great. Obama and Clinton are such liars. Just look at videos and during the last election, these two ran against each other.
11 | Annette Ansley | 9 | 725925144239180_727197317445296 | Let's see: 650,000 emails reviewed in 9 days. That's 70,000 per day. On an around the clock review that's about 3,000 per hour or 50 per minute. Close to one per second. Yup, I'm ok with his absolution. The system is rigged!
12 | Yvonne Lomelino | 6 | 725925144239180_727240870774274 | Well doesn't really matter what you say I'm still voting for Trump it is definitely time for a Change and I can't understand why you are campaigning for Hillary when you should be at the White House taking care of what you are suppose to be doing! !!

14 | Tao Valentine | 4 | 725925144239180_727197977445230 | In this election, at this time, voting is the most patriotic thing we can do. We have the power to shape our families, our communities, and our country. Don't let a giant talking turd covered in Cheeto crumbs tell you democracy doesn't work, or that your vote doesn't matter. Democracy works because your vote matters.
15 | Rebecca Dougherty | 1 | 725925144239180_727211514110543 | Nobody has to know who you voted for. When you show up, if the Republicans try to harass you, tell them you are showing up to vote for Trump and they will let you in. Lol. You know, there was a polling of married male Trump supporters. All the men said their wives would be voting for Trump, but about 30% of those wives said they would be voting for Hillary. Hahaha. Don't let anyone intimidate you, not the Republicans, not your spouse, family or church.
16 | Jason Rayborn | 0 | 725925144239180_727402424091452 | Hillary's father, Hugh Rodham, Sr., was reportedly a "fixer" and "bagman" for banks and insurance companies, here and overseas. Her brothers have reportedly aligned themselves with business in the former Soviet Union, described by some as with the criminal oligarchs of the Russian mafiya and their laundry banks. In the Clinton administration, there was no effective scrutiny or restraint of the Russian criminals operating in U.S. big cities, like Chicago, Cleveland, and New York. America's secret political police, the FBI, the CIA, and the DEA, have been willfully blind. With impunity, dope from Southwest Red China floods into the U.S. through Chicago as a major intake point. According to law enforcement personnel, the Rodhams reportedly stem from links to the Gambino crime family in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
17 | Moose Skaff | 2 | 725925144239180_727204844111210 | Did MSNBC do a story on Hillary hanging out with the known woman abuser Jay Z this weekend? How about the WikiLeaks emails detailing how the DNC and Hillary defrauded Bernie Sanders supporters and rigged the debates? No,I didn't think so.

2 | Donna Bowman-Pilling | 4 | 1344068735689375_1344104185685830 | It is pretty sad that our Corporate Media no longer gives "REAL NEWS" to the people in this country. God forbid they discuss TPP, Net Neutrality, or the truth that Marco Rubio inserted a rider in the 2015 budget destroy the "risk corridor" in the Affordable Care Act which initiated the for profit health insurance companies to raise premiums. I realize people are busy working, raising their families, but there are some people in this country who are retired not working, etc who should be finding out this information because it is out there, but instead they spend time on video games, or listening to right-wing hate radio. This is our country, I don't want to be turned into what Hitler did in Germany. Wake up people!
3 | Francisco Galdamez | 5 | 1344068735689375_1344164229013159 | Donald Trump is a scumbag at its finest in quality. Lets be realistic here people. Donald talks about our economy . How jobs are flying overseas!well last time I checked he is one of  the types of business men he is describing .He has lots of businesses out of the U.S of A. To avoid taxes . He talks about how the system walks all over the little guy but wait a minute, he does step all over the little guy by sueing and pumping fear into contractors that try to collect the full amount of money for their honest hard work they provided.He talks about law and order. How can trump supporters block in their minds  all the sexual assualts that Donald trump has done in his lifetime? More than just one is true, thats all it takesTo know that this man should be in jail and registered as a SEX OFFENDER not registered as a PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE! A poor man gets accused he is jailed until proven innocent. A rich man gets accused he roaming free and is thought to be above the law!#NEVERTRUMP2016

5 | Jack Morris | 0 | 1344068735689375_1344849952277920 | Ten reasons to vote Democrat #10. I vote Democrat because I love the fact that I can now marry whatever I want. I've decided to marry my German Shepherd.#9. I vote Democrat because I believe oil companies' profits of 4% on a gallon of gas are obscene, but the government taxing the same gallon at 15% isn't.#8. I vote Democrat because I believe the government will do a better job of spending the money I earn than I would.#7. I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is fine as long as nobody is offended by it.#6. I vote Democrat because I'm way too irresponsible to own a gun, and I know that my local police are all I need to protect me from murderers and thieves. I am also thankful that we have a 911 service that gets police to your home in order to identify your body after a home invasion. It will take the police an average of about 15 minutes to get to your house; 00 buckshot travels at about 1200 ft/sec.#5. I vote Democrat because I'm not concerned about millions of babies being aborted so long as we keep all death row inmates alive and comfy.#4. I vote Democrat because I think illegal aliens have a right to free health care, education, and Social Security benefits, and we should take away Social Security from those who paid into it.#3. I vote Democrat because I believe that businesses should not be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to break even and give the rest away to the government for redistribution as the Democrat Party sees fit.#2. I vote Democrat because I believe liberal judges need to rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit fringe kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters.And, the #1 reason I vote Democrat is because I think it's better to pay $billions$ for oil to people who hate us, but not drill our own because it might upset some endangered beetle, gopher, or fish here in America. We don't care about the beetles, gophers, or fish in those other countries

13 | Shari Simpson Wilcoxon | 0 | 1344068735689375_1344313645664884 | I Just Lost All Faith In Our Deeply Corrupt Legal System And In The Rule Of Law In The United StatesPOLITICS, CRIME, CONSPIRACYby MICHAEL SNYDERThe FBI just gave Hillary Clinton the biggest gift in the history of presidential politics. Two days before the election the FBI has announced that they are ending their investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs mishandling of classified information. After reviewing the emails that were found on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner, FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress telling them that ‚Äúwe have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.‚Äù That means that there will be no indictment, and the path is now clear for Hillary Clinton to become the next president of the United States on Tuesday unless an election miracle happens.These days it is unusual for a news story to hit me on a deeply emotional level, but this one sure did. When the FBI originally announced that they were renewing this investigation, it gave me a glimmer of hope that there may be a little bit of integrity left in our legal system.But after today‚Äôs announcement I have lost all faith in our deeply corrupt system of justice. America has become a lawless nation, and the rule of law is completely dead in this country.Yes, it is true that those of us in the general public do not know what was contained in those emails, and Director Comey says that nothing significant was found in them‚Ä¶In a letter to lawmakers, Comey said the FBI is standing by its original findings, made in July, that Clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information over email as secretary of State.‚ÄúThe FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,‚Äù Comey said in the letter. ‚ÄúDuring that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of State,‚Äù Comey wrote. ‚ÄúBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.‚ÄùBut of course the truth is that the FBI already had more than enough to go after Clinton based on what they discovered the first time around.In the world of national security, if you transmit a single classified document via a channel that is unsecured, you will lose your security clearance in a heartbeat and it is quite likely that you will be prosecuted and sent to prison for mishandling classified information.In fact, two different members of the U.S. military were recently convicted for doing precisely that‚Ä¶Just last month, Bryan Nishimura, a California Naval reservist, was sentenced to two years‚Äô probation and a $7,500 fine after he pleaded guilty to removing classified material and downloading it to a personal electronic device. The FBI found no evidence he planned to distribute the material.Last year, Bronze Star recipient and combat veteran Chief Petty Officer Lyle White pleaded guilty to storing classified documents on a nonsecure hard drive in Virginia. He received a suspended 60-day sentence and a suspended $10,000 fine in return for the plea. White said the information was for training purposes to study and that he had no intent to communicate with anyone.Neither of those individuals intended to mishandle classified information, and they certainly never intended to share it.But they were both convicted anyway.So what makes Hillary Clinton any different?During the initial investigation, the FBI found 113 emails that contained classified information‚Ä¶Clinton had repeatedly said she did not have any classified emails on her server, but the results of the FBI investigation show that claim was incorrect.Of the tens of thousands of emails investigators reviewed, 113 contained classified information, and three of those had classification markers. FBI Director James Comey has said Clinton should have known that some of the 113 were classified, but others she might have understandably missed.And I would be willing to bet that the FBI found some more classified emails that they had not seen previously among the 650,000 or so that they reviewed for this renewed investigation.But it doesn‚Äôt matter now. Hillary Clinton is free as a bird even though she mishandled 113 classified emails, and it looks like she is going to become the next president of the United States on Tuesday.As a law student and then later as an attorney working in Washington D.C., I got to see just how deeply corrupt our legal system has become.But after today, I don‚Äôt see how any American can ever have faith in the rule of law again.If the law does not apply equally to all persons at all times and in all circumstances, we might as well not even have a legal system.At this point, there is only one way that some sort of justice can be achieved in this case. And that is if the American people go to the polls on Tuesday and vote to keep her out of the White House.It won‚Äôt be perfect justice of course, but at least it would keep Hillary Clinton from getting what she wants more than anything else in life.The choice before the American people is very simple. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt politician to ever run for the presidency, and the extremely long laundry list of Clinton scandals and crimes has been well documented over the past three decades.The voters know exactly what they are getting with her. And if they choose her anyway despite all of the things that have been revealed, that means that America is willingly choosing lawlessness.To most conservatives, this election is all about Trump, but I believe that it is far more about Hillary Clinton.I am convinced that we are at a pivotal moment in American history, and if the American people willingly choose Hillary Clinton it will be an indication that there is zero hope for the future of this nation.So let us pray for an election miracle, because right now Donald Trump is behind in most national polls and time is running out.
14 | Carmen Lescas | 0 | 1344068735689375_1344088232354092 | Hillary created this by being dishonest, by going around congress, by lying to the FBI, by lying to congress and by lying to the American people. Comey is just the messenger. Don't blame the gun, blame the human who fires it.The Clintons have been selling the country at the expense of the American worker. This house of cards is crumbling, the ACA is crumbling, just the other day Loretta Lynch had to plead the 5th on the Iran ransom money. Obama's admin is falling apart right before our eyes. I have NEVER seen so much corruption in this country. We're like a banana republic.
15 | Ramon Cordero | 2 | 1344068735689375_1344134182349497 | So much for the so called emails scandal. Republicans were trying to find anything to see what sticks. Get over it. You got nothing on her now. She is a good person and will be your next president. Trump is a hateful, racist, arrogant, person and will never be our president. Americans want someone that represent our values. Trump does not live up to those values.
16 | Annette Ansley | 3 | 1344068735689375_1344117645684484 | Let's see: 650,000 emails reviewed in 9 days. That's 70,000 per day. On an around the clock review that's about 3,000 per hour or 50 per minute. Close to one per second. Yup, I'm ok with his absolution. The system is rigged!
17 | Franklin Strum | 0 | 1344068735689375_1344137145682534 | Look even in my state Kansas. Non citizens will vote. The people who registered on the National Voter Registration Form have not been verified to be citizens. The state can't verify because of activist judges. I just hope enough Kansas residents that are US Citizens outnumber the non citizens illegally voting in this election. I just wish Obama would have not secured this election for Hillary and other Democrats by not deporting illegals and not getting rid of citizenship verification. And with Hillary promising executive order pathway to citizenship you know non citizens will vote.
18 | Franklin Strum | 0 | 1344068735689375_1344146049014977 | Trump should challenge this election. I have no doubt if he forced all states to check voters if they are who they say they are, voted only once and are US citizens you will see fraud at it's highest in this election. States can only verify voters are eligible especially citizenship status for fraud, and Trump can contest to initiate a nationwide fraud check that means checking every single ballot not just the 100-200 ballots each state only checks for fraud in each election
19 | Franklin Strum | 0 | 1344068735689375_1344140269015555 | It's obvious Trump was leading in battleground states and in dead heat in others. That liberal organizations and activists judges wanted the dead people and non citizens secure the election for Hillary and Democrats.

Also, School Choice, bringing education back to the states, Audit The Fed, lowering our taxes, lowering taxes on companies to 15%, less interventionist foreign policy, federal hiring freeze, fixing veteran care, no mandated vaccines, term limits, defunding the U.N., a national right to carry, protecting our 2nd Amendment, Supreme Court Justices who will protect and defend The Constitution, are enough reasons for me to vote for Mr. Trump! For the most liberty, right at our fingertips, Vote Trump!

8 | Deedee Isie | 259 | 1344027412360174_1344031342359781 | FOX NEWS AND GIULIANI ARE TRAITORS. NO CASAE AGAINST HILLARY SAYS FBI DIRECTOR
9 | Cassandra M. Stewart | 265 | 1344027412360174_1344033089026273 | Kellyanne Conway is so pitiful. Her head is about to explode! I hope she's getting paid big time for selling out her personal integrity.
10 | Linda Clawson-Freeman | 197 | 1344027412360174_1344033075692941 | Why won't you all let us listen in on President Obama??? Instead, we have to listen to this twit.....Grrrr, how frustrating.
11 | Courtney Juana Dillard | 119 | 1344027412360174_1344036229025959 | Yes us Democrats do feel that the FBI should have gotten the facts before they put out the letter to Congress. All of this could have been avoided.
12 | Steven Eric Lovato | 125 | 1344027412360174_1344035115692737 | Honesty? Like Melania Trump working illegally, or Donald Trump sexually assaulting woman? Yeah, Trump is nothing more then a FRAUD, a BIGOT, a RACIST, a SEXIST and a SEXUAL PREDATOR. #DumpTrump #ImWithHer
13 | Dottie Kelly | 99 | 1344027412360174_1344036279025954 | She has that smirk, glazed eyes look that says "I am not listening or responding to what you are saying because I already have my script in my head". I loathe this woman and cringe every time anyone interviews her.
14 | Phil Mastman | 102 | 1344027412360174_1344031979026384 | I am so looking forward to never seeing Ms. Conway again.
15 | Roberto Perez | 88 | 1344027412360174_1344030139026568 | But she's done nothing wrong. She's never been charged with anything. Get over it people.
16 | Charlize-ann Gonzalez | 100 | 1344027412360174_1344032295693019 | Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (and has cheated on his wives). Elect him. Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. Put her in jail. 2 Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem. Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State).  So savvy... Put him in the white house. Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz. Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible. Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is. Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support him and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact. Your memes are not news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform.#trumpisapieceofshit#orangturd
17 | Monique Johnson | 52 | 1344027412360174_1344044282358487 | My God, does this woman ever stop for a breath.  I wish the media would realize that they can interrupt and correct her when she is lying.
18 | D Manuel Espinosa | 79 | 1344027412360174_1344035942359321 | Kellyanne Conway STFU. MSNBC everytime you have Kellyanne on you should have a Clinton campaign manager, chairmen, or surrogate to disk after her lies and rhetoric. She's a LIAR and FRAUD just like her candidate. Biased media for trump.
19 | Sylvia Queen | 61 | 1344027412360174_1344050505691198 | Kellyanne, don't use big words you don't understand...words like honesty, trustworthiness, and veracity. If you understood, you would know that Madam President Hillary Clinton possesses all of those qualities and more, whether you like it or not.
20 | Donna Mackintosh | 59 | 1344027412360174_1344036015692647 | Still makes me mad that Comey intervened and ruined the huge win Hillary would have had. She is still going to win but I don't think she will get the electoral college victory I wanted.
21 | Thomas J. Beaver | 52 | 1344027412360174_1344033962359519 | No "backtracking" from this Clinton supporter wrt Comey ... screw Comey ... the damage has been done, he put his thumb on the scale, the FBI piled on with a 10 pound weight ... it took her down 2 points. The damage is done - did I say that? Screw him. Comey was wrong in July, he was wrong a week ago, he's wrong now. The FBI is tainted, corrupt. The days of Herbert Hoover are back (... and, FWIW, Guilani may well be in legal trouble).
22 | Sherry Johnson Balch | 45 | 1344027412360174_1344036385692610 | Just listening to this ignorant twit would drive me to vote for Clinton if nothing else. The fact that I rarely see an MSNBC interviewer herd her back to the topic/question asked of her about Trump when she immediately starts talking about Clinton to avoid answering each and every time floors me. You all need to learn to get your answers and not get played by a propagandist. CNN has been doing a better  job at this with her.
23 | Jar A Raf | 37 | 1344027412360174_1344039642358951 | Go try something else.... We don't care what you guys think... Hillary is way more honest then Trump.... Let Trump shows his e mails and his unpaid taxes..... Talk about that and stop losing your time.... Because Hillary will be the next president of the USA.... Period.!!!
24 | Emmit Penny | 31 | 1344027412360174_1344038502359065 | I can't wait till November 9th when Trump refuses to pay anyone and sues the lot for his loss. The FBI still maintains that there has been no wrong doing on the part of Sectary Clinton. He says they still won't be filing charges. Most likely Hillary rigged the whole thing. üòÇüòÇüòÇRemember VOTE BLUE!!!
25 | Kim Ritter | 42 | 1344027412360174_1344039715692277 | So what would we have found if Wikileaks have published emails from the Trump Foundation, the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Christie, Ailes and the rest of the corrupt crew? Why should America trust Trump and Conway, when the Canadians just published a list of 500 lies that he told?
