2 | Jodi Schupbach Marsh | 24 | 1555347497818608_1555386927814665 | Every time someone sees or hears something they don't like it's biasedüòÇ, no you're just a turd with nothing better to do but piss and moan because you're a miserable person.
3 | Jack Eric Williams | 23 | 1555347497818608_1555388731147818 | It's just a fricking cup. No different than a McDonald's cup. You will be tossing it in the trash in a hour anyway. Get a life.
4 | Heather Ferris-Lehman | 26 | 1555347497818608_1555383764481648 | Literally every comment here but mine right now is a spam anti-Hillary comment. LMFAO. Do you guys actually think this crap works?!
5 | Dawn Krause Camp | 3 | 1555347497818608_1555396234480401 | Maybe I'm oblivious, but I don't see what the issue is?? Too many non-white looking faces for you all?? Get over yourselves!! Ugh seriously find a real reason to be outraged! There are real true things out there to be worked up about other than what the freaking Starbucks cup looks like.
6 | Beth Kamphaus Knotts | 10 | 1555347497818608_1555388424481182 | God forbid we strive for unity and tolerance during the holiday season, that Christians believe heralded the birth of the price of peace.  It's not like he espoused, love thy neighbor, and judge not lest ye be judged and said all men were his brother or anything.  SMH
7 | Courtney Usher | 5 | 1555347497818608_1555391461147545 | It's what in the inside that counts. Your drink will taste the same and guess what? You can THROW it away when you're done! üò¶ otherwise you can just miss out on the yummy holiday drinks. #getoveryourself #itsjustacoffeecup
8 | James Laubhan | 8 | 1555347497818608_1555388771147814 | Conservatives and unity are two words that do NOT go hand in hand. No wonder they hate the cup. Can't believe I even have to type that, it's a cup of coffee !
9 | Stephannie Austin | 2 | 1555347497818608_1555391357814222 | Who cares or takes time to worry about a coffee cup!! Just make coffee at home then if the cup ruins it for you. Life's too short!
10 | Chris Lee | 1 | 1555347497818608_1555401131146578 | Man, Trumpsters complain about SJWs getting all bent out of shape when you drop insensitive racial slurs on the POTUS' children, but god forbid you change the color of a coffee cup and make it about inclusiveness and togetherness.Ya'll are the saddest, most pathetic piles of garbage I've ever seen in my life. I am immensely proud to not be a part of Trump's supporters.I am so glad to be apart from them.
11 | Ren√©e Noelle Pinto | 1 | 1555347497818608_1555396204480404 | WHO is actually mad about this??? I want the news stations to go out and find people who will actually comment on this and show their faces, because I can't believe ANYBODY would seriously complain about a green unity cup. If all the "evidence" of angry people is twitter accounts and instagram users, I'm not convinced. Where are all of you outraged people?
12 | Mary T. Smith Seifert | 1 | 1555347497818608_1555391757814182 | Oh for Pete's sake there are people starving who can't afford Starbucks and this is what we get upset about?

15 | Laura Rodriguez | 2 | 1555347497818608_1555394347813923 | Love Starbucks, and the concept of "unity" behind the cup's design.  I would prefer it to be recyclable, but will still be a loyal patron of Starbucks.  (They are working on a more ecologically friendly cup, that will hopefully be out soon.)It is too bad folks are always looking for yet another thing to be outraged about. (And the political posts seem take over here, no matter what the topic of the news story may be.  It's ridiculous.)  Going to enjoy a delicious Venti Mocha Frappuchino now! PeaceüôÇ
16 | Cheryl Rhoades | 1 | 1555347497818608_1555400224480002 | Oh my goodness this is ridiculous the cup represents unity nothing else and in this year of craziness isn't that what we should all be thinking about instead of bullying and hatred!!!  Stand firm Starbucks and keep the cup!!!
17 | Rick Stoll | 0 | 1555347497818608_1555402231146468 | WTF. Cmon man. Again he acts like a spoiled child who doesn't get his own way. You Trump supporters sure have a lot of patience with him.  Oh I forgot, he's going to make America great, again. Pathetic.
18 | Brian Pope | 0 | 1555347497818608_1555398454480179 | Once again people are more worked up about what's on the cup than the overpriced drink inside of it. And you call yourselves "conservative?
19 | Terri Watts McCarthy | 4 | 1555347497818608_1555388597814498 | First world problems. If the worst thing in your life is what color your $10 cup of coffee is, YOU are a big part of the problem.
20 | Jerry Wizman | 1 | 1555347497818608_1555384401148251 | If you want to understand a society, take a good look at the drugs it uses. And what can this tell you about American culture? Well, look at the drugs we use. Except for pharmaceutical poison, there are essentially only two drugs that Western civilization tolerates: Caffeine from Monday to Friday to energize you enough to make you a productive member of society, and alcohol from Friday to Monday to keep you too stupid to figure out the prison that you are living in... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzMLDw_ecqo&feature=youtube_gdata_player

24 | Jennifer Marie | 3 | 1555347497818608_1555388207814537 | If you have all day to complain about a paper coffee cup you obviously have bigger issues at hand...

John Kasich's spokesman confirmed on Monday that the Ohio governor wrote in Sen. John McCain's name.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jim Nab | 263 | 1555356161151075_1555358567817501 | No disappointment here! Kasich is a decent man that will not support morons like Trump and Pence. He is putting his country and ideology ahead of his party loyalty like any decent human being will do.
2 | Jason Counter | 117 | 1555356161151075_1555359867817371 | NBC News, why won't you address Donald Trump's child rape case that he's going to be facing trial for on December 16th!?
3 | Erick J. Sorto | 79 | 1555356161151075_1555359537817404 | Kasich was the only Republican with decent sense. BTW Trump is not a Republican he is the leader of a white nationalist movement and many smart Repuicans know it.
4 | Nick McGargill | 34 | 1555356161151075_1555374417815916 | Republicans could have chosen Kaisch as their nominee who is a decent man of character, who I would have voted for over Hillary Clinton. Instead, Republicans chose a racist immature and unhinged demagogue whose hobbies include grabbing women by the pussy. Congrats Republicans, you must be proud. Because you chose the worst candidate in history, I'm voting for her.
5 | Lonnie L Burnside | 18 | 1555356161151075_1555365411150150 | Yep what's going to happen when his boss is convicted of rape of a 12 year old ? Or when he is convicted of tax evasion and fraud? He claimed bankruptcy 6 times and just admitted on tape ( I have never gone bankrupt) so which is it did you really go bankrupt or did you just screw all your investors and employees?
6 | Jim Descher | 13 | 1555356161151075_1555380741148617 | John Kasich is the only candidate who I thought might sway me to vote Republican. I wanted him to make it tough for me. But right wing voters fell to a snake oil salesman and I will vote for Hillary Clinton. She is not perfect. But I refuse to consider Trump who has shown he is a pig, a bigot, and a racist over and over.
7 | Taylor Seitz | 11 | 1555356161151075_1555368627816495 | It says a lot that even some conservative Republicans have enough integrity to refuse to support Trump's bigoted and offensive campaign.
8 | Chad Pierre | 4 | 1555356161151075_1555377551148936 | John Kasich is a decent man and does not support RACISM, BIGOTRY, Misogyny, Demagoguery, and the list goes on!  Speaker Paul Ryan Supports all the above and this is why he voted for that lunatic TRUMP!
9 | Scott Kriegsfeld | 1 | 1555356161151075_1555392867814071 | I can't think of any reason why John Kasich would show support for a Moron and a anatomically correct humanoid that appears to have a Pepsi bottle shoved up his anal orifice.
10 | Bobby Ca√±as | 6 | 1555356161151075_1555361597817198 | I bet Kasich wants to run again 4 years if Trump wins or loses. He's banking on the fact that the GOP wont support trump in 4 years cause a lot already dont support him. I hope he beats trump if he wins too. Trumo is nuts. Im a Democrat and i cant vite for hillary either and if the Republicans would have put someone other than trump or cruz cause hes nuts to i would have voted republican for once even Kasich i would have voted for president over hillary. Kasich is actually not a bad governor besides his anti union and anti prevailing wage hes brought jobs back to ohio
11 | Amy Steenstra-Gentry | 2 | 1555356161151075_1555391874480837 | Im not a Kasich fan but Im happy that he did vote his conscience and didn't sell out like Cruz. Its nice to see someone put the USA before their party. He should have been their canidate.
12 | Chris Lee | 1 | 1555356161151075_1555376027815755 | Why would he? The ship is sinking. Get to the lifeboats. The ideological plague that is fascist, right-wing, racist conservatism has claimed its latest victim and it's name is Grand Ol' Party.
13 | Jill Daw Respass | 2 | 1555356161151075_1555384524481572 | I will go on the record and say that any Republican in the state of Colorado better be a supporter of the Trump/Pence ticket in November. We as citizens have a right to know how our elected officials voted and we will be watching. Their future appointments WILL depend on them supporting their own candidates. I recommend EVERYONE to hold their elected officials accountable as well. Take the time to check how they voted and send them a letter either thanking them or serving them notice.
14 | Susan L Whitesall | 0 | 1555356161151075_1555402847813073 | Awww, a true republican, out of all of them I liked him mostüëçsince they chose the worst, being an independent, I voted for Clinton, and my Republican daughter and son in law, are sitting this one out, my son and daughter in law were Sanders supporters and millinials, they voted Clinton too, that's just how fowl the Republican candidate is. Pills mean little, but those electoral votes.......mean everything. Hang in there folks November 8th is just 6 days away. Vote blue up and down!!!
15 | Sarah Hammons | 1 | 1555356161151075_1555398071146884 | Kasich is a secure and confident man unlike the others who are cowards and cant think for them selves and flip as it suites their needs just like trump.if anyone thinks trump has magically changed this week is fooling them selves and delousional.he is an actor who pkays the part he needs.but he is stll dangerous and ingnorant.
16 | Kevin Peterson | 1 | 1555356161151075_1555397054480319 | Romney Pence  McConnell Portman all great intelligent men. Trump is a fool that couldn't make Atlantic City great again..You YOU want to give him the country...I am not going to have my plumber balance my checkbook and fix my truck if he's in debt and doesn't know what a carburetor is.

20 | Robert Hansen | 0 | 1555356161151075_1555371151149576 | While most of us want to be united, there is no doubt we are living in a divided time and in many ways this election has us more divided than ever. This is especially the case when it comes to race and religion. You may have heard the story earlier this week about a protestor at a Trump rally chanting "Jew S-A." That is just one of the moments in this campaign that are causing concern. That said it's no surprise that those who study hate groups in America are closely monitoring white nationalists and their support of Donald Trump. Mark Potok from Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the country‚Äôs leading experts on the extreme right says Trump is playing "footsie" with hate groups. And some members of these groups are saying electing Donald Trump "is our last chance." As part of a new documentary I did for AXS TV Potok told me:"Trump is getting a lot of support from the white supremacists' world, we know that some people in the white supremacists' movement have been actively involved." He goes on to say, "The radical right in the United States absolutely adores Donald Trump. He is the best thing they have seen, and they say this almost universally, since George Wallace ran for the presidency in 1968 essentially as a segregationist. What the hate groups are really saying about Trump is he represents us. This is maybe the last chance we have to make this country White again, as they say. So they call Donald Trump in many cases, our glorious leader. they refer to Trump sometimes as Emperor Trump. Some of them have explicitly compared him to Adolf Hitler." There is so much more to this and it is all part of the eye-opening new documentary called "America Divided--The Rise of Trump Nation." It premieres tonight at 9pm ET/8pm CT on AXS-TV. Much of my interview with Potok is attached to this post as well so please take a look.Also before you watch tonight I leave you with this question, what do you think of when you hear Trump say "Make America Great Again?" I'm interested to hear your comments below.Dan Rather......
21 | Mike Hutchisson | 6 | 1555356161151075_1555371681149523 | The real disappointment is the GOP nominated an egotistical racist and misogynist for president, and that Republicans like Pence are okay with that.

24 | Chris Blaschke | 0 | 1555356161151075_1555402174479807 | More and more people are starting to see how dangerous trump is. He wants to bomb everybody wants to take away people's right to choose for them selves who they love and marry and take away women's rights to choose what they do with their own body...choice is freedom...so if you belive in freedom vote pro choice. If you take away people's ability to choose then we loose our freedom
25 | Jesse Semmes | 0 | 1555356161151075_1555372764482748 | Just get used to saying President Trump. Hillary, Huma and Weiner have disgraced the Democratic Party. Then add on Obama's failed ACA. üòÇüòÇüòÇDemocrats have lost the White House for at least the next 8 years.

"Be sure you boycott Chobani Yogurt! That Muzzie that owns it is hell bent on filling Idaho with Muslims," one critic tweeted last month.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Brian Alfano | 972 | 1555309837822374_1555310574488967 | So ridiculous if they're here legally then they should be able to get a job. This is all Trump's fault with his fear mongering and hateful rhetoric
2 | Jennifer Cameron C | 977 | 1555309837822374_1555312277822130 | I love Chobani! I'll make a point to buy more! The hatred and ignorance in this country is astounding.
3 | Osman Safak | 667 | 1555309837822374_1555312627822095 | Chobani announced that they will only hire refugees who came here Legally!! Didn't you white trash intolerant Trump supporters say you were okay with immigration as long as it's done legally? Did I miss something???
4 | Richard C. Kelley | 368 | 1555309837822374_1555333184486706 | This pisses me off! This man made a success of himself and is giving back to his community. Last April he gave ALL of his employees a 10% stake in the company when he sells or is bought-out.....which is HIGHLY likely! He also pays very well and gives great benefits! He contributes to his communities and is a great man. You don't have to like his politics, but lay off his religion and how he chooses to support others!
5 | Veronica Harter | 182 | 1555309837822374_1555320564487968 | Now I'll have to buy Chobani. Even Muslims need to eat. Glad they can get a job. Or am I allowed to buy products made only by Christians? Well, that would mean no more products from China, Bangladesh, and many other companies owned by the Trumps.
6 | Sara Stewart | 175 | 1555309837822374_1555313871155304 | makes me want to go out and buy it. I'm sure he offers ALL of his employees the same benefits and if the refugees are legal, people need to shut the hell up and get over it
7 | David Dillon | 120 | 1555309837822374_1555320481154643 | Calm down. He's been doing this for YEARS. Why is this an issue all of a sudden? None of this is illegal. Wouldn't you rather people working instead of living off of government assistance? People would probably complain about that too. Smh
8 | Steve Kemp | 149 | 1555309837822374_1555312337822124 | Cool , If they want to boycott ............ I will only buy Chobani !  Screw the hating racists !
9 | Justyna Phillips | 81 | 1555309837822374_1555312157822142 | This makes me like them even more! Also "filling Idaho with muslims..."? Really? LOL
10 | Zabi Habash | 74 | 1555309837822374_1555311657822192 | We will build a wall around Chobani Yogurt and will have Chobani Yogurt pay for it.
11 | Mayra Figueroa | 19 | 1555309837822374_1555342741152417 | Chobani is a great company to work for.  Trump trash can kiss off. If they are refugees and are willing to work legally then that is fabulous. They are respectable, honest and hard working. At least they are willing to work which is more than what I can say for some of the Trump trash that have no jobs and are ignorant racist.
12 | Leilani Kilpatrick | 20 | 1555309837822374_1555345607818797 | Wow I had no idea that Idaho was still so racist! Maybe leftover white supremists.  A very sad point, for all other good Idahoans.  He also literally gave his company to his employees!  It is now employee owned and has many "white" employees too.
13 | Allison Ouellette | 27 | 1555309837822374_1555334794486545 | How many American companies offer language classes? Paternity leave? A living wage? Just give shares of stock to employees? Not just refugees, but all employees? This is not only good business practice, it's how we should demand American owned companies behave. He's got not problem making profits and creating jobs...obviously
14 | Karen Hultgren | 18 | 1555309837822374_1555349427818415 | Wow... here's a guy trying to help refugees who were forced from their homes, lost family, have endured horrible violence and lost everything - and he's being threatened?  He should be celebrated.When my great grandparents came to this country someone employed them.  We should do the same.
15 | Anne Gochnour | 16 | 1555309837822374_1555363004483724 | There is a Chobani factory close to where I live and the people working there, white, brown, pink and purple, are very happy with their employer and their jobs. He is not a bad man and does great things for the economy
16 | Sahra Merrill H.Kott | 11 | 1555309837822374_1555345724485452 | Looks delicious to me ...is it kosher ? apparently it is a great company and treats its employees really well ...including parental leave for both parents and all kinds of other kind perks...Sounds like these are wonderful people and Chobani is a Great Company with a great human kindness attitude.Just checked ...It is Kosher....Yay Chobani !!!@
17 | Lisa Donnelly McNally | 12 | 1555309837822374_1555332164486808 | If it weren't for immigration many of us wouldn't be here, lets not forget where many of our ancestors are from. Immigrants helped build this country. So sad what we have become.
18 | Anela Grbic | 11 | 1555309837822374_1555367397816618 | Well..being an American Muslim and never tried this yogurt..I am off to the store now and will buy as many of Chobani yogurts as I can..any suggestions on which one is good??
19 | Roger Reed | 6 | 1555309837822374_1555353317818026 | PLEASE FORGIVE MY WORDS they are NEEDED to make a Point:  I don't know about refugees undocumented workers or anything like that but any scumbags slimy puke that wants to refer to Muslims is muzzies or lesbians as dykes or blacks his coons or gays as fags...people that stoop to that level anyone... is a sick twisted piece of crap and that vile despicable less than human scum bag that would use names for people... deserved to be exposed for the scum cowards they are....they want everything to go their way and they deserve nothing because they have learned nothing and they are nothing and they represent nothing and they speak for no one and they will get nothing...
20 | Linda Klammer | 9 | 1555309837822374_1555352271151464 | Kudos to Chobani founder, Hamdi Ulukaya. Your good deeds caused my switch to Chobani yogurt... and I'm so glad I switched. I remain your loyal customer.
21 | Thomas Ryan | 6 | 1555309837822374_1555347171151974 | Wait, NOW you care about who is employing who??What about the decades worth of American "businessmen" exploiting cheap labor by hiring illegals... instead of paying Americans a livable wage to do the same work??
22 | MaryJo Fundock | 5 | 1555309837822374_1555320077821350 | This isn't trumps fault. But - yes they are employed but do you realize that they are still subsidized as well by the government? They pay no taxes on their pay. They have free housing, free health care, foodstamps etc. They are making great money, not giving anything back to the US and still are able to try and make us Muslims. They want the same "rules" as a muslim and they want everything Sharia. They will not assimilate. Therefore, I will not buy Choboni and it has nothing to do with any political party except the Dems who are allowing this to happen to our country.
23 | Michelle Sery Sichak | 9 | 1555309837822374_1555359077817450 | I love Chobani.  The owner is a caring human being and treats his employees very well.  We will keep buying it and supporting this great company.  Poo on the haters!
24 | Robert Gray | 7 | 1555309837822374_1555358641150827 | This is the most ridiculous thing I've seen since the Starbucks cup fiasco. I eat Chobani daily. I lost a lot of weight from eating their delicious and healthy product. Boycott all you want. More for me.
25 | Kevin D. Johnson | 8 | 1555309837822374_1555374054482619 | Trump has incited violence against Muslims, Hispanics, blacks, gays, women, in short against anyone not a white "Christian" male. This is not the kind of country I want. I choose tolerance, compassion, understanding, mercy, justice, equality. These traits, sorely lacking among trump's base, are what truly make us great.

Officials say they are not dismissing the possibility that it was a hate crime.

2 | Howard Bliss | 1 | 1555274807825877_1555325211154170 | we really need to stop rushing to judge situations - remember innocent until proven guilty?  someone should consider the number of these cases that CAIR rushed to label hate crimes so they could grab a headline only for the case to be shown as Muslim vs. Muslim violence - e.g., the mosque fire in Texas and the cabbie shot in Boston (?).  Let's see what the facts are before stoking revenge and guilt hate prematurely and purposelessly..
3 | Stephen Mader | 1 | 1555274807825877_1555295541157137 | Let me get this straight: a hate crime charge is simply another and separate charge added on, so potentially, white people can be charged twice and punished twice because they're white. I think you're not getting what "equality" means. Also, I don't think it's white people that can't see systemic racism.

But what if he is actually fueling people who hate non-whites. Would you still vote for him?

Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik, the DOJ official in charge of the email investigation, emailed Podesta a heads-up on developments related to Clinton's State Department emails in May 2015.Under the subject "heads up," Kadzik wrote: There is a HJC [House Judiciary Committee] oversight hearing today. Likely to get questions on State Department emails. Another filing in the FOIA case went in last night or will go in this am that indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails."Podesta wrote back, adding other Clinton aides, "additional chances for mischief."Kadzik used a private Gmail address to send the note, not his .gov email account.

11 | April Sparacino-Powers | 0 | 1555179464502078_1555401824479842 | Mrs. Clinton, Your speeches are sounding and looking very, very desperate now. Your speeches for the most part are hypocritical. You talk about how Trumps campaign breeds hate and incites violence, but its your campaign inciting violence at Republican events. You call Republican supporters dark, negative and dangerous, along with being a basket of deplorable's. So how can you say you want to be everyone's president. What about the bucket of losers you have called Bernie supporters and millennials or the Catholics you have issues with. Now your inciting things by telling democrat supporters to stage interventions. You seem to forget, that our rights allow us to vote for who we like, democrat or republican and your inciting interventions goes against our right to do that. You dodge, avoid and avert the focus anytime your asked to answer questions about your wrong doings, but you want us to forgive your mistakes. Everyone is talking about what Donna Brazile did with the questions for the debates, but my concern is, you didn't say no to Donna Brazile. You accepted the questions she gave you and rehearsed your answers. Just one more thing to prove you can't be trusted. I don't hear you condemning the voter fraud going on. I don't hear you addressing anything that really has the American people upset. For example, Obamacare,. You want to make changes to it. We dont want it. Its not working. Your not listening. You and your rich supporters do not have the same worries as a good percent of the people of this country when it comes to Health insurance. You lie, you cheat, your ignore rules and laws of our country. People have died under your watch that could of been avoided. You lied to their families. And now your treating the American people as though they are stupid by telling the Director of the FBI to release the information. But we are smart enough to put the shoe on the other foot, and say a guilty person would know this the information can't be released until the investigation is complete. So lie to us some more so you can get elected and then get a pardon. We also know that there is also the option of O'bama pardoning you as well. Its happened before. You can say what ever you want, but many of us know your a criminal, you lie and you have no respect for any of us. You'll never be my president.

24 | Warren Gilda Upson | 0 | 1555179464502078_1555348794485145 | You should not be campaigning. Wonder what you are trying to hide. Afraid that if Quacky Trump wins, he will uncover it and open your can of worms?
25 | Kelly Duffy Sage | 0 | 1555179464502078_1555275894492435 | REASONS TO NOT VOTE HILLARY‚ö†If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left?

These kids can't vote for real. But one day they will. 

Nearly 400,000 kids cast their votes for Hillary Clinton or Donald J. Trump in a nationwide mock election. Here's who won: http://nbcnews.to/2eogksI
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Amanda Wingle | 305 | 1555110787842279_1555140247839333 | This could be a wonderful and constructive activity IF the kids were required to read up on the issues (at an age-appropriate level, of course) and vote based on that. What I see here is just kids parroting what their parents say, on both sides. While I am liberal and shudder to think that my future kids could be conservative (lol) what I really want is for them to learn to research, draw their own conclusions, and think for themselves.
2 | Adriana Liliƒá | 264 | 1555110787842279_1555136007839757 | "I'm voting for trump cause he is a republican" That is not the reason to vote for someone. It just shows which parents brainwash their kids more
3 | Tim Crawford | 61 | 1555110787842279_1555137757839582 | Look at Haiti and the Clinton Foundation! If you still Vote for Hillary after they've stole Billions from the Haitian people your blind. They only gave pennies on the dollar out of all that was donated. #GREED
4 | JJ Janczak | 37 | 1555110787842279_1555147764505248 | NBC is manipulating the kids voting habits at an early age, so that their minds can be more easily controlled by a corrupt WashDC in bed with the corrupt news media. NBC = Nothing But Corruption.
5 | Jackson Sharon | 32 | 1555110787842279_1555169927836365 | I asked a young  Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a ‚Äúmisogynist, a racist and a bigot‚Äù. Here is her answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.  Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.  Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.  Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.  Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.  Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.  Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?  Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration.  I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.    Because I fear for my family‚Äôs safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues ‚Äì which is a threat to our way of life.  Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration.  Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.  Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.  Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.  And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.
6 | Angeliki de Morgan | 27 | 1555110787842279_1555137724506252 | It is scary how brainwashed these kids are. To vote for any candidate just because of their political affiliation is not a good reason to vote! You vote for the issues that they want to address. Dang!
7 | Joe Lillard | 11 | 1555110787842279_1555154694504555 | I have a hard time believing this. I live in Maine and just last week they did a statewide mock election of school age children and Donald Trump won by about 800 votes out of around 14,000 cast. Somethings fishy......
8 | Patricia Cruz | 14 | 1555110787842279_1555153647837993 | My daughter voted this year and it was the first time it actually counted she turned 18. I told her to research both candidates and then decide who she thought would do a better job. She's away at school, she phoned to say she did absentee ballot. She said Trump had a lot of baggage and was not the best candidate but Hillary's lies and her being investigated and all the emails coming out were bad but the nail in Hillary's coffin was her stand on late term abortion. She voted for Mr Trump. I'm proud of my baby girl!!!!!
9 | Krystal Dortch Ramirez | 10 | 1555110787842279_1555146221172069 | Explain late term abortion procedures to them and describe how our men in Benghazi were tortured and killed while waiting for a rescue that never came. I bet that would make them think harder about who to vote for...but then they are just kids....these are ugly things in the world that we need to shield our children from...but someday, unfortunately they will know the ugly truth. We all will.
10 | Anthony L Barrett | 16 | 1555110787842279_1555134837839874 | We all know what would happen, like with that black mom, what she did to her son on video, trying to take away all his things so that he would vote for hillary.. Kids are forced to mirror their parents liberal totalitarian views everytime..
11 | Monnett Arambula | 7 | 1555110787842279_1555151981171493 | ...true story...when I was in Jr.High, it was the Presidential Election between Kennedy and Nixon.  All my family were Democrats, voting for Kennedy, but my best friend was from a very Conservative family and they were voting for Nixon.  At school she was passing out pins for her friends to wear and gave me such a browbeating that I actually wore one of the buttons...just to please her.  I still cringe at the pressure that was put on me to "fall in line".
12 | Heather Knapp | 5 | 1555110787842279_1555174804502544 | All clinton does is talk about kids....so naturally kids would want to vote for her. They don't realize she agrees with killing babies and a criminal.
13 | Denis Poitras | 12 | 1555110787842279_1555141321172559 | Like someone said and I totally agree with. Hillary would be the first Mom president. We had how many Dad presidents. Moms devotes themselves 300% more than any Dad. I'd rather have a bitchy fighting Mom  Hillary as president than a sperm donor like Dad Trump that has a fit when his dinner is not ready.
14 | Janie Neal | 0 | 1555110787842279_1555165334503491 | We had to do this when I was in Jr High, the whole school. I voted democrat then also. I wasn't influenced by my parents because my parents didn't vote. Yes they are American citizens. I have voted Democrat in every election except one I believe, since then.
15 | Valerie Wagner | 1 | 1555110787842279_1555163484503676 | This election has brought my oldest to say he's interested in politics and can't wait to vote. It's also brought my youngest to share with a complete stranger that we don't like Trump because he isn't nice to people and makes his friends fear their families will be torn apart. All of my kids know who they'd vote for and why and I support that. At least they have a reason. Both the funniest and saddest reason in this video was voting for Trump so she could grow up and be the first woman president. Great aspirations though, I'll give her that.
16 | Nicole Ellis Lawrence | 5 | 1555110787842279_1555153561171335 | Stupid propaganda, they go with what they have heard their idiot liberal parents say. In our schools in Tennessee we went Trump. This is pointless.
17 | Rusty Schramm | 2 | 1555110787842279_1555173314502693 | Oh come here n Brad Huckabay you know as well as anyone the minor party candidates don't stand a chance .  That's why they call them "Minor" üòú
18 | Mudabbir Ahmed | 2 | 1555110787842279_1555268761159815 | Sadly all Trump "voters" here are reciting parents talking points!Building Wall, Mexicans out, keeping safe!!Literally they have no ideas what any of it means!Same is true for Hillary ones as well but atleast their reason is that she helps kids & families, not for kicking people out!
19 | Laura Ellen | 2 | 1555110787842279_1555158797837478 | This tells us nothing. Most of these kids are probably afraid to vote for Trump for fear their teacher will verbally attack them OR give them poor grades. Happens. I bet if they didn't have to put their names on the cards the results would be much different. Poor kids.
20 | Marnean Buggs | 1 | 1555110787842279_1555176931168998 | The hatred is real in these comments. Of course the kids will mimic what they see at home, but that doesn't mean that once they really learn the process, they will vote the same way. Even if they do vote the same way, it's their choice. Calling people names because of the candidate they choose to support is really childish.  You don't have to agree with someone's  choice to respect them. It goes both ways.
21 | Jill Thompson McDonough | 2 | 1555110787842279_1555177867835571 | I love that they do this, but I really wish they'd provide these kids with the facts or make them research it themselves. My son was for Hillary. I asked why and he couldn't give a good reason. I set him down and explained the basic pros and cons of both and he said I'd vote Trump, killing babies, lying to dead soldiers families and stealing is not someone I want as a president. Smart kid. We vote Trump in our home ‚ô°
22 | Jillian Horton | 0 | 1555110787842279_1555261954493829 | Except for the fact you can't tell these kids what is actually going on and why they shouldn't vote for one or the other because most of it isn't something you would talk about with a small child. So they are voting for what they hear their parents talk about not actually making their own decision.
23 | Abby Milligan | 0 | 1555110787842279_1555361864483838 | These people on here telling them to explain to 8 year olds sexual assault and late term abortion and Benghazi need to take a step back and remember, these are 8 year olds. Do not start dragging them into adult affairs, all this more than likely was is a lesson in the basics of democracy. Calm down a little.
24 | Sherrie Teyner Williams | 1 | 1555110787842279_1555214691165222 | I vividly remember doing this for the 1976 election, Carter v. Ford.  I actually "voted" for the eventual winner, Jimmy Carter! I'm not sure what made me vote for Carter, since my political opinions were not strongly formed at 7 years old.
25 | Wendy Margarita | 1 | 1555110787842279_1555197764500248 | You would be surprised how many ADULTS go and vote without reading up on the issues!!! Just by what they are hearing on news channels and here say.... its a sad truth. But yes lets get them reading up on issues early on, like high school.

"My client is not a meme. He's a human being. And his rights have been trampled," Cosby's lawyer said.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Deana McDowell Crider | 722 | 1555105394509485_1555106827842675 | I think the victim identifies the criminal, not the other way around.
2 | Frank Craft | 230 | 1555105394509485_1555121904507834 | To all those asking why it took so long for women to come forward: You're exactly the reason why women don't come forward in the first place. Victim blaming and name-calling. They come forward now because other women came forward. Cases like these always follow this course. Theirs finally isn't a isolated story that no one would believe. They found solidarity among other victims. Should we ignore all the pedophilia cases in the Catholic Church? After all, they're from really long ago, and according to your logic, should be dismissed.
3 | Angel Alves | 290 | 1555105394509485_1555111444508880 | Good lord,  they are pouring it on thick.  Since he is "blind" it affects his memory.  Sound like a guilty man trying to get out of something to me.  Blind isn't a defense
4 | Polly Wally | 65 | 1555105394509485_1555114567841901 | COSBY CLAIMS TO HAVE VIOLATED NO ONE.. sooo if that is the case he does not need to see their faces to defend himself.. Besides, Me thinks he is just trying one more manuver to get out of facing reality of what he has done.
5 | Molly Runyon | 50 | 1555105394509485_1555129804507044 | When he did the interview with his wife, he could see just fine. So, nothings changed. Nice try. They can identify him! In a line up, like a police line up, that's all they need. Hey Cosby, call Trump, tell him to use you excuse.
6 | Jennifer Hajdics | 79 | 1555105394509485_1555106857842672 | I can think of more than 30 women who's rights I care more about than Bill Cosby's.
7 | Kristi Carreon | 46 | 1555105394509485_1555121927841165 | why are we so quick to put him away when the same allegations are being brought forth from women against trump and THAT is ok!? this is seriously messed up. both should equally be penalized!
8 | Armando Rodriguez | 36 | 1555105394509485_1555127237840634 | It took many years for Cosby's victims to come forward and speak out yet nobody questioned it. Meanwhile it took many years for Trumps victims to do the same and Trump supporters blame the victims and try to shame them for it even after he brags about doing such things. We as a nation are so lost and confused it's not even funny.
9 | Onica Annika | 26 | 1555105394509485_1555111734508851 | Nah... I was legally blind earlier this year and I could tell who people were if they got up in my face. He just needs to have a screen enlarged so he can see or allow them to come right over to him.  He's still going to trial.
10 | Israel Emmanuel | 27 | 1555105394509485_1555119551174736 | A successful man can't even get old in peace in the United States. I have a question, what took the women so long?? Ok if you believe these women and call Cosby all these names why is your Donald Trump innocent?? I mean there wasn't a tape where Cosby said he loves to rape women.
11 | Wendy Burke-Ryan | 11 | 1555105394509485_1555135751173116 | No, he's not a meme. He's a rapist. He should be accountable for all the lives he's damaged no matter how old he is. Jail would good.
12 | Kevin D. Johnson | 14 | 1555105394509485_1555113411175350 | I was a fan of his. Even though he has not been convicted the number of victims that have come forth telling the same story is damning. I am so sad and angry.
13 | Jeanette Wedsworth | 6 | 1555105394509485_1555119991174692 | He's not s poor man! How would you feel if he druged and rape you!!! Your mom, sister, child? Oh hell NO!!! His lawyer is setting the case that he is old, blind, pees on himself, diabetes, obesity, sleep deprivation!!!!I could go on but get the picture üò°to hell with himüò°
14 | Tamica Hudson-Celada | 8 | 1555105394509485_1555119447841413 | Hes a predator,who hid behind his jovial personality and Hollywood for yrs.hopefully he will die in prison,with a " yuge" jello pop for company.cuz theres always room for jello;)
15 | Thomas Strandbygaard | 3 | 1555105394509485_1555135444506480 | I'm not sure how accurate it is saying his rights have been trampled.... The constitution makes zero promises for how the general public treats you. It's a contract between the federal government and the individual only. In his case, his public persona and actions earned him the place in the meme sphere. If he didn't want to be mocked and memed - maybe he should have considered that *before* drugging and raping so many women that this action could become know as "pulling a Cosby".
16 | Kelly Morris Samons | 1 | 1555105394509485_1555163067837051 | I don't think all these women are lying.  None of them have anything to gain from accusing someone like Bill Cosby of crimes like these. I doubt he even spends the night in jail or ever pays a dime except the hush money he paid a few years ago, but these women should be listened to.
17 | Beth Kaihlanen | 2 | 1555105394509485_1555150324504992 | "I need to see them to know if I assaulted them." So the answer is yes he has assaulted women, he just wants to be sure the right ones are accusing him. Was this supposed to make me feel better/sorry for him?
18 | Mike Fisher | 2 | 1555105394509485_1555119791174712 | Their eyes were shut when he did to them what he did. Now his eyes are shut for good as they have their way with him. Seems fair enough . . . At least God thinks so!
19 | Debbi Constable Nordstrom | 1 | 1555105394509485_1555231701163521 | You've got to be kidding me! When did he go blind!? And the defense said he's" legally blind" now? Um so am I because my eyesight is bad but I wear corrective lenses. I think they are trying everything they can to get this serial rapist free of charges. Stand up and be a man Cosby!!
20 | Jamie McIver | 0 | 1555105394509485_1555154187837939 | His attorneys are specifically speaking to the 13 "witnesses" who have also made allegations against Cosby, but like everyone else, the statute of limitations has expired. They are being identified through photos. Some of these "witnesses" have made allegations from 45-50 years ago whom he hasn't seen in that that time. Everyone knows who Andrea Constand is. That's not the issue. Just like he may not remember the details from 45-50 years ago, these "witnesses" from that long ago can't really be considered credible. This is why we have a statute of limitations.
21 | Sandy Hills | 3 | 1555105394509485_1555202224499802 | And what difference does it make if he's blind now...he had sight when he was busy drugging and committing rape on women!
22 | Jayne Birch | 2 | 1555105394509485_1555179607835397 | "My client is not a meme. He's a human being. And his rights have been trampled," Cosby's lawyer said. If only your client had thought about that before he drugged & raped all of those women. Rape is rape. Being blind, old, rich & once famous should not have any reflection on the sentence.
23 | Jessica Lee | 0 | 1555105394509485_578605872324377 | His rights have been trampled ü§î.... Get the hell out of here! What about the rights of the women he violated???? Smh.... He should be in prison whether he is blind, deaf, dumb, whatever! He should have thought about that before, when he was drugging women and taking advantage of them! P.O.S!!! !!!
24 | Linda Mahrous | 0 | 1555105394509485_578605865657711 | My opinion: Cosby was a swinger and he hooked up with wanna be starlets who would bed the devil to reach their goal of fame. The pot calling the kettle black. Long time passing...money on their minds... they're old worn out has beens......time to stop their whining.
25 | Michael Williams | 1 | 1555105394509485_1555200124500012 | Nice try on his defense Council. Yet, I have no doubts,  that Mr Cosby may have engage in these railed against him.these women have no reason too lie, just to be lying................I also believe the women bring the charges against, one Donald J Trump isn't lying as well, and that his case deserves the same amount of attention, and that yes, he did those thing's leveled against him to.

Just how significant could the Latino vote be in the 2016 election?

NBC Latino breaks it down, and explains the appeal of Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton to Latino voters in key battleground states.

1 | Leonardo Guimaraes | 39 | 1555095807843777_1555107507842607 | As a Legal (American citizen) Latino I'll tell you this: The Obama administration did nothing for illegal aliens and now wants to protect them? At least Trump has its plan: You are either legal or deported!!!!

There is room for more than just two parties

All the minorites combined doesnt even match half of the white men, not to mention all the white women. Whites will decide this election period, and its goin to be Trump by a landslide.
7 | Warren Murray | 0 | 1555095807843777_1555173977835960 | It's obvious that trump has nothing to lose, he didn't think he would make it this far in the first place. He has no problem saying what people want to hear to get his way, which is the same way he built his hotels and landscapes by agreeing to have companies build them while he had no intention on paying many of them. He has abused the bankruptcy and court system using his crooked lawyers to find loopholes and file lawsuits to intimidate his creditors. He will do the same thing to the American people, while he leaves our government in shambles as bush did, he will go back to his penthouse and brag about how he swindled his way to the white house. Those who vote trump or don't vote at all, could eventually receive what they deserve. Be careful what you ask for, you just may get it.
8 | Alberto Ortiz | 1 | 1555095807843777_1555119294508095 | A letter full of vagueness coming from a FBI Director,11 days before election day!!  Isn't it a mere wink to trump? Of course it is."We never thought we were going to say thank you to Anthony Weiner." - trump (10-30-2016).When trump's people have all their hopes on Weiner and on the ‚Äúcourtesy‚Äù of WikiLeaks, 06 days before election day, it means one thing and one thing only : trump‚Äôs people have nothing against Hillary and they are behind. Any doubt ask Kellyanne Conway or Jeanine Pirro. This isn't an opinion, this is a fact; just listen to trump's surrogates.Taking into consideration the fact that we are not shown the trump's Book of Revelation (his tax returns), thus anything coming from trump's mouth against Hillary will be considered a lie.  It‚Äôs very simple : just Open the book!Remember this : "Russia, if you‚Äôre listening, I hope you‚Äôre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.‚Äù - words from donald "Putin's puppet" trump. Is he looking for another ‚Äúcourtesy‚Äù?This is an easy one: This election is about Hillary or the Kremlin's oligarchy. No need to say more.As an American Hispanic, but as an American first, I will vote for who is the target of WikiLeaks, because I will not be an enabler of someone or something that is willing to manipulate and divide us from abroad via ‚Äúcourtesies‚Äù. At the end of the day, who is going to pay the price for all those courtesies? Our children are not expendable. Period.
9 | Sandra Kephart | 2 | 1555095807843777_1555133807839977 | Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person to ever run for President of the United States of America. She has made herself an empire The Clinton Foundation that accepts millions of dollars in donations from foreign donors. Selling off America is what she's doing. She's had 30yrs to help the American people. We take better care of the refugees coming into our country than our own people. Research what they get for free when they come here. It's time to take care of our people first with those trillions of dollars, then we can help others.  Bill Clinton had multiple affairs in the White House while married. Then lied on Monica Lewinsky. Humiliated a woman saying he did not have sexual relations with that woman. That woman saved a dress with his semen on it to prove he was lying on her. He put a woman through that? We need change in America, not another career politician. We have lost all faith in our Government and the FBI. Hillary Clinton should be in prison!

17 | James Graul | 0 | 1555095807843777_1555151691171522 | Obama in his book Dreams of my Father said he chose his friends carefully; the Marxist professors and the structural feminist. He also said that Islam is a religion of peace, that the Koran is holy, and that no one will prosper who slanders the prophet. I contend that on the world stage Islam and Marxism represent the two great anti-Christ forces today. The fact that president Obama is so affectionate to both of these ideologies ought to be alarming to people who have studied Marxism and the teachings of Muhammad. Marxism is still alive as philosophy and its very much alive in the progressive democratic movement. Marxism is dialectical materialism. The materialism part says there is energy and matter but there is no spirit; hence religion is the opiate of the people. The dialectic is that demographic groups are struggling for domination and power. The ones who have power will not relinquish power so it must be taken by revolutionary violence. In the communist manifest we see that these concepts apply in nature. The seed coat is in a struggle with the germ and the coats must be destroyed so the germ can survive. That is why is Marxism you see the raised fist and the constant division. The war on women. Pitting men against women. Racial contention; pitting races against each other. Pitting the worker against the capitalist. Pitting the aged against the young. The idea that one is taking from the other and the remedy must come from violence too achieve justice. Marxism is about rage and anger. It is about one group hating another group. Marxism is alive and well in the Black Lives Matter movement which has nothing of the spirit of Martin Luther King and pits black people against the police as they chant "pigs in a blanket fry them like bacon." BLM reeks of Marxism. What is Marxism really? It is a materialistic philosophy that is hostile to religion and exacerbates tension between people and magnifies civil unrest. It promises a one world workers paradise through revolutionary violence, which is a false imitation of the coming kingdom of heaven on earth. It must be alive because we have many Marxist professors in our universities. It disguises itself with words like progressive, or socialist but Marxism is Marxism. It was one of the goals of Marxism to get into the universities and the train up media and teachers in Marxist thought. Obama in his book Dreams of my Father said he chose his friends carefully the Marxist professors and the structural feminist. Obama's mentor was Frank Marshall Davis who is mentioned affectionately 22 times in his memoir. Davis was a card carrying communist who hated Winston Churchill, loved Stalin, and was for the advancement of the Soviet Empire. Both Clinton and Obama were students of Saul Alinsky who wrote the manual for community organizers; Rules for Radicals. This book teaches how to use the civil rules of a community to turn the community on it's head. How to seize power. It uses division to conquer, and demonizes authority and who the book was dedicated to should tell you all you need to know. The book was dedicated to the first rebel Satan. Yes Obama wrote the book Dreams of my Father but his biological father abandoned him early in life. His mother handed him over to her mother. So who were the fatherly influences in Obama's life? As I mentioned it was Frank Marshall Davis who was for the destruction of the west and Saul Alinsky. What brings Marxism and Islam together? They both hunger for the destruction of both America and Israel. They both want to bring down the miserable house of the West. So they are temporary bedfellows. In the early nineties the Muslim Brotherhood issued a strategy edict on how to bring down the ‚Äúmiserable‚Äù house of the west. They would use immigration as a tool of Jihad and simply outbreed the infidel once inside his country. You can look to Europe and the no go zones in France and England to see how successful they have been in Europe. President Obama has great affection toward Islam and says no one will prosper who slanders the prophet (Muhammad). He constantly refers to the Koran as holy. What does Islam say about Jews? 1. Bukhari (52:177) - Allah's Apostle said, "The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say."O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him." What does Islam say about Christians? Quran 9:30 ‚ÄúAnd the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah; and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah; these are the words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may Allah destroy them; how they are turned away!‚Äù There is only one book that is holy and that is the bible and any teaching that would teach a different gospel than the one Paul preached is accursed. Paul taught God as father, Jesus as son, Jesus crucified for our sins and Jesus resurrected, all things emphatically denied by the Koran. Paul said even if an angel brings you a different gospel and that is what Muhammad said. Muhammad said an angel gave him his inspiration. The angel Gabriel in fact. The same Gabriel that announced to Mary that she would bear the son of God. That has to be ironic cause Islam denies Jesus as the son and anyone who would call Jesus the son of God that Allah should destroy him. So Islam hijacked and corrupted much of the bible. Now Marxism and Islam each have a different idea of what the New World Order will be but for now they will be partners to bring down America and Israel. Clinton is for open borders and the diminishment of America as a country with language, culture, and borders usurped. People are being deceived by our leaders and saltless saints are ignoring the truth. Obama lit up the whitehouse to celebrate ungodly marriage. He proclaimed a gay pride month. How can one have pride in mortal sin? He said a man and man is as admirable as a man and a woman. Jesus said one man and one woman should become one flesh. He never said a man and a man should be one flesh.  That is not just spiritually awful it is biologically insane. Sodomy is insanity. Or as Muhammad said that a man can become one flesh with four women. And both bigamy and sodomy are blasphemous. President Obama hired Kevin Jennings as deputy safe school czar to bring homosexual propoganda into our classroom; Jennings wrote the introduction to the book The Queering of elementary Education. Do you really want your elementary kids queered. Shameful. He also issued and edict to mandate that schools allow children to determine their own sex or they would lose federal funding. Now the lesson plan becomes for children that their gender is fluid and they can choose their own sex. Such rot. And people have either reprobate or deceived minds that think this president is cool. Not in God's eyes. What does the bible say about people who imposter their sex. It is forbidden. So is homosexuality. And Obama promotes it all. I am just giving my opinion after careful thought and prayer. You are welcome to agree or disagree with me. But I hope you can see I have given this careful and prayerful thought. I have done my due diligence.http://www.free2pray.info/communism.html

It is a sad day in the United States of America when the news media only tells one side of the story. NBC, and CBS are a huge disappointment to the general public.
2 | David Tibergien | 281 | 1555025624517462_1555028747850483 | The candidate & his campaign should face tougher questions on why the KKK, Neo-Nazis, and White Nationalists are attracted to Donald Trump.

Yet Clinton loves taking money from the Saudis and you love her. He is not, nor has he ever been labeled a racist until he runs for president and wouldn't you know, it comes from all the sissy libs playing that tired old card.

10 | Taylor Seitz | 12 | 1555025624517462_1555083867844971 | It really doesn't matter whether or not Trump rejects the KKK's endorsement. The KKK certainly doesn't care. They know that, no matter what he says on the campaign trail, his racist, homophobic, xenophobic policies will greatly benefit their deplorable mission to restore white supremacy; they would not have endorsed Trump otherwise. The Trump campaign claims "their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign." Yet polls show at least 31% of their supporters actually do share most of their views. Clearly, they know that a victory for Trump is a victory for white nationalism. It is imperative for all sensible, patriotic Americans to stand together against the vile scourge of white supremacy that plagues our democracy.
11 | Patricia Foulk-Reynolds | 5 | 1555025624517462_1555039857849372 | Panther representative and a kkk leader were in a head to head interview and both said they donated money and endorse Hillary. I have no faith in media to tell the truth.#CatherineOBrien.Look her up and hear how sick our government is. Her story includes republicans and democrats. Bush Hillary and pentagon.
12 | Johnny Williams | 5 | 1555025624517462_1555125884507436 | I wonder why the KKK, Neo-Nazis, and White Supremacist groups all backing and voting for Donald Trump? Because in Trump slogan "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN" is code for make America white again with all other colors falling at the bottom of the totem pole.
13 | Vicky Jarboe | 2 | 1555025624517462_1555093314510693 | The demicrates are just grasping at anything that they think will stick.Sorry I asked a young  Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a ‚Äúmisogynist, a racist and a bigot‚Äù. Here is her answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.  Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.  Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.  Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.  Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.  Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.  Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?  Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration.  I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.    Because I fear for my family‚Äôs safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues ‚Äì which is a threat to our way of life.  Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration.  Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.  Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.  Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.  And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.
14 | Danny Healy | 6 | 1555025624517462_1555055437847814 | Time to, get real and be honest.

15 | Lynndy West | 22 | 1555025624517462_1555028987850459 | An analysis of Trump's Twitter account revealed that his racism is no accident. Donald Trump has retweeted white supremacists 75 times since his campaign began.
16 | Kelley Storey | 1 | 1555025624517462_1122439957811259 | Sorry but a little to late to reject your make America white again friends!  Just like last weekend was a little to late to be trying to win over African Americans.  You encouraged the white supremacist.  You threw your number one black  supporter out of your rally and called him a thug.  Way too late to change your status!
17 | Matt Argyle | 2 | 1555025624517462_1555066254513399 | He hasn't denied them at all before this. Assuming this is a real story. If he's doing it now its just one of his last ditch efforts to con his constituency. (that means the people who vote for him for you supporters of his)
18 | Bridget Barber | 2 | 1555025624517462_1122431444478777 | Trump has NOT openly rejected the KKK!!! His campaign is not him. Just more sheep ok with his racism and ignorance and justify it with ignorant information and words that resemble Donald. Full of nonsense and lies.
19 | Anthony Figeroux | 0 | 1555025624517462_1668889426735209 | Of course his campaign denounced them because it's too close to Election Day. If he elected he's going to embrace them with open arms. It'll be beneficial for whites so can't be mad at whites for supporting Trump. I believe blacks knew this day would come. Question is are we ready to die.
20 | Barbara A Yelvington | 2 | 1555025624517462_1555050277848330 | You can reject anything you like Trump but the reality is your platform resonates with a certain level of people.. I thank God they do not endorse Hillary!!

If the KKK supports Trump, then are they not expressing their democratic right in as much the Black Panthers support attacks against police of which little is said as it may be politically inappropriate to do so.

5 | Shikaro Awori | 107 | 1555008294519195_1555021581184533 | Wow. The excuses and ignorance in these comments are astounding! White supremacists have been burning black churches in the south long before Hillary ran for president, even prior to her birth! So how the heck is she responsible for this?
6 | Gary Warren | 71 | 1555008294519195_1555016807851677 | I bet this was a Hillary supporter , only idiots would believe someone is going to burn a church down and than put who they support on there( like that does your vote good).
7 | Alex Hammer | 57 | 1555008294519195_1555018471184844 | Funny how the FBI is messing around this election regarding the clintons either emails or the pardon that the PRESIDENT at the time Clinton gave;But refuses to investigate the russian connection with putin, the call for Espionage to be conducted by Foreign entities by Trump, the violation of the Cuban embargo by trump.I think maybe President Obama should order the IRS to release trumps taxes for the past 20 years (for the noninformed hes allowed to do). #POTUS #election2016 #hillary #Hillary2016

9 | Mustapha Konneh | 47 | 1555008294519195_1555019261184765 | After observing Trumpism for about two years, I have finally come to this conclusion: Trump's America is The United Hate Of America while Hillary's America is The United States Of America. The choice is clear, let's choose Unity over Hate....!
10 | Marie Garside | 33 | 1555008294519195_1555015697851788 | Shocking and extremely sad to think that something like this can happen.  Trump has emboldened some violent people when he refused to disavow the KKK.
11 | Keith Mikell | 21 | 1555008294519195_1555022454517779 | This is a setup. A diversion. Don't fall into it. With the kkk stuff yesterday and this today, it's all to cover Hilary's bs. They are scratching for the life of their campaign as of this point.
12 | Patrick McClintock | 7 | 1555008294519195_1238868446181159 | I can't believe the FBI is going to take time away from their important mission of going through HRC's e-mails to investigate this act of terrorism.

15 | Michael Anderson | 11 | 1555008294519195_1555046627848695 | This is nothing more than Hillary shills trying to frame Trump for inciting violence. The only people that hate Christians are the establishment democrats.
16 | Melanie Parish | 26 | 1555008294519195_1555010457852312 | Paid liberal protestor. They are desperate to undo the latest fallout from Hillary's email FBI criminal investigation

18 | Tim Stangl | 9 | 1555008294519195_1555030964516928 | What would Trump or his supporters gain from this?  What would the demwits and HRC gain from this?  Sometimes you have to look between the lines and figure out what is happening use simple logic and stop believing everything just because the tabloids tell you what to believe. I have no idea who did this I do however know who has something to gain out of it.
19 | Henry Akatsuki Uchiha | 12 | 1555008294519195_1555019844518040 | Some of the comments here are absolutely ridiculous the fact of that matter is whoever did this committed a crime it doesn't matter who's voting for who plus this presidential election has become chaotic over two idiots I'll wait on the hate comments but it's the reality of things
20 | Amy Mullen | 10 | 1555008294519195_1555035077849850 | The most fascinating aspect of this story is how many people are sure they know what happened.

I wish I could speak so recklessly and get away with it.

22 | Sonya Boyd Collier | 1 | 1555008294519195_679718548863304 | The news is always quick to do a story before facts when they can blame Trump supporters!! They just can't wait for them to have a suspect in custody or a suspect period!! This is more media brainwashing and another way y'all are trying to persuade people to vote for Hilliary!! For all anyone with a brain who can think for themselves is concerned it could also be a Hilliary supporter trying to sabotage Trumps chance of winning!! That is why facts are important. Since it hasn't been proven one way or another it is an opinion!!
23 | Peter James Wambold | 1 | 1555008294519195_1238899212844749 | Who the FK would go such a thing then attach someone else's name to it?Prosecute to the fullest extent of the law, I'm sure trump or no one else would condone . Attempt to cause damage to trumps brand
24 | Nick Clemens | 2 | 1555008294519195_576182892567699 | This was also probably funded by the Clinton campaign to paint trump supporters in a negative light lol you honestly never know these days Kegan Rounds
25 | Chris Richardson | 4 | 1555008294519195_1555051421181549 | This seems like BS. It doesn't even make sense to burn a black church and then put vote Trump! This would never benefit Trump or his supporters. It makes a lot more sense that someone did this to perpetuate hate! They wanted to burn the church and have you blame Trump supporters. Which it seems all of you bought hook line n sinker. But this just screams setup!It could've been some really racist guy but I doubt he's a real Trump support. Besides 80-90% of the violent acts have been caused by ignorant kids that are Hillary supporters not from your average middle class working middle age white Trump supporters. A few yes but not most not even close.

WroteTHE STORY OF HILLARY IN A NUT SHELLA "MUST READ"To all of us, who are glued to the news, watching the election, the story unfolds as written by its author, Hillary Clinton.  She just couldn‚Äôt sit still and mind her own business.  After leaving the White House, she could have had a wonderful life.  She and Bill could have made millions in honest and decent ways.  Instead, the temptation to make hundreds of millions was too hard to resist.  She started to sell her influence, probably a little at first and it grew.Eventually, the Clintons started to get some huge payments with her run against Obama with the likelihood that she would run a better campaign later.  As Secretary of State, there was more influence to sell through the Clinton Foundation and through payments for speeches.  She probably prompted some of the largest payments into the multimillions by telling her donors that she was going to run for the presidency.  It worked.  Why else would Saudi Arabia donate more than $25 Million?  These donors were gambling, they played the odds, and Hillary had to play the part.  She had to run for president.  She would have been as good as dead if she didn‚Äôt even try. So, there she was, not knee deep, but over her head with Bill and even involving her daughter, running a criminal enterprise selling influence.  She was on a path which she could no longer abandon. This middle class woman was no innocent victim.  Her greed and her ego were in step with the pragmatic need to run for president.   As she and Bill were experienced presidents, she knew all the tricks to get into office, and she knew all the mischief she could inflict once she became the Queen of the kingdom.  She set this whole thing in motion, and just like the murderers we watch on Forensic Files, she thought that she was smart enough to get away with crimes about as serious as murder.  She rationalized just as criminals do.As with other criminals, once she was used to running her influence selling organization, after a while, she thought that she would never get caught.  After all, Bill had been the President of the United States, and his and her prestige put them on a platform of impenetrability.  Unfortunately, for her, like most criminals, she could not anticipate every turn, every person, every nook and cranny.  She probably would have gotten away with her crimes if she would have stayed as private as possible, but she just couldn‚Äôt just leave it alone.  She had to go public by running for the office of the President of the United States.  She had to put herself under a microscope.Now she is getting caught.She didn‚Äôt anticipate her mistakes or that someone like Donald J. Trump would come along to expose her criminality.  While we are watching the election, seeing the beginning of the rise of Donald J. Trump, we are also going to see the decline of Hillary Clinton and what has literally turned into a crime family.   She is desperate.  Her back is against a wall.  She has about half of the population and most people who matter totally involved.  One problem she has, though, is that her mentality has evolved and grown.  Once a person strays far from the path of decency, her criminal mentality leads to more and more actions which are off the wall.  She arranged for violent protestors to attend Trump rallies.  She probably arranged for false testimony from Mr. Khan and the women who claimed Donald J. Trump groped them.  She had no hesitation in labeling a decent man to be a bigot and a racist.  She did so well that almost half of America thinks extremely poorly about Donald J. Trump.  She was getting away with all this, too.Alas she made one mistake which was the beginning of her downfall.To make sure that there would be no criminal charges against her, Hillary orchestrated the payment of more than $675,000 to one of Director Comey‚Äôs trusted agents.  Due to Wikileaks, she got caught on this one.When James Comey decided to not prosecute, I had suggested that, in time, he would be ultimately seen as an American hero, the kind who used to be played by Jimmy Stewart.  He is probably a decent honest man who delegated responsibilities to his trusted men and women, and who believed what they reported.No doubt, Agent McCabe‚Äôs wife received this sum which is huge for an FBI agent, and then, Agent McCabe used his influence to wiggle his way to manage the investigation of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails.  It is no wonder she had such confidence that she would never be caught.  She had infiltrated the FBI  Now, we are just past the point in the typical Forensic Files case where the police have heard allegations of unimaginable criminality from a prior president (and wife) of the United States.  The police and almost half of America could not believe that someone with all that stature would become a head of a master criminal enterprise.  Their imaginations just couldn‚Äôt recognize something as ridiculous to be something which is tragically true.  Now, James Comey knows that she infiltrated his organization and corrupted one of his most trusted agents.  Once the police know who committed the crime, or in this case that there was a crime, they get on the path to prove and prosecute their case.  For so long, Director Comey was fed lies and he relied on the false information provided by Mr. McCabe.  Now, we are at the point where the police are looking at Hillary‚Äôs emails like a pack of hounds.  They are seeing the dark side. Now that Director Comey knows of the bribery, the bloom is off the rose.  She is exposed.  The police know that she is guilty.  Now, they are moving at rocket speed.  I am sure that Agent McCabe is no longer in charge of the investigation.  Other agents, honest ones, are hitting it as fast and as thoroughly as possible.Now, it is just a matter of time.  The FBI are on to her, and she is so guilty of so much, she will be exposed, hopefully before the election.  After all, she wants all the evidence put ‚Äúon the table.‚Äù  She may get her wish.I doubt that they will be able to get things together fast enough, but there is a possibility that she will be charged and arrested before the election.Now, Hillary is able to put her mind out of reality when she performs her rally act, but there must be moments in the day when reality clicks in and she gets frightened.  She must be waking up at 2:00 o‚Äôclock in the morning in a cold sweat.  She knows that Mr. Comey knows.  She knows that she is going to get caught.  Her only hope is to become president fast enough and control the process.  Mr. Comey is a true American hero who will pull the plug before that can happen.  In fact, his annoucement last week may have done the trick.Donald J. Trump is right.  This is worse than Watergate.  This is unbelievably worse.  This is an American tragedy, which even Shakespeare couldn‚Äôt have written.As lawyers say, ‚ÄúThe truth will out.‚Äù  Hillary Clinton is a criminal who has grown to a level we see only in comic books.  At this point, her goose is cooked.Watch her at her rallies as she plays her part.  Too bad that she has so many surrogates (some completely innocent) who speak for her.  In this regard, we will see if the Obamas continue to support her.  How did she get them to join her campaign?  Will we find that she corrupted them, too?One way or another, this is one of the greatest stories in American history.  Thankfully, we have Donald J. Trump to fix so much at this point.[If you appreciate this post, please do what you can to spread it.  Share it, Tweet it.  Email it.  Please get this word out.]

I love the little details that certain people just know....FREEDUMB!  What I hadn't realized until a couple of days ago was that when they couldn't prove "gross negligence" (which would have been a crime) Comey couldn't say she was "innocent" (because the Republicans would have exploded)...so he basically made up "extreme carelessness" which is not a thing and said she was "guilty" of that....lol.

19 | Matthew Shallar | 0 | 1554985447854813_1748195872108452 | We, the people of this country, matter... there is too much corruption, conspiring, and illegal activity associated with the Clinton cartel to make everyone understand that the crooked DNC and their ordained candidate, Hillary Clinton, do not believe this. They have disenfranchised too many in their own party to now play "let's be friends." Obama himself threw Hillary under the bus when he was running against her and nothing's changed since that time... she is still the same crooked person he spoke of during his campaign. Baseball cap or not, Hillary Clinton, and the Clinton brand, is bad for American politics, we, the people, and will only fail this nation like she's done so many times in the past. A vote for Hillary equals a vote for the destruction of this nation.

The family of an elderly Alzheimer's patient say photos taken inside a New Jersey care center show their mother was left to sit in her own feces with excrement smeared across her face.

1 | Stephanie Sumner | 1748 | 1554968407856517_1554970544522970 | As someone who has cared for the elderly, this angers me SO much! If you don't want to work with the elderly then DONT! Many of us actually ENJOY caring for them and take pride in our job...
2 | Marissa Peart | 1264 | 1554968407856517_1554971591189532 | This is what happens when nursing homes give one cna 15 people to care for. If you never worked in a facility you would never know. Dementia patients dig inside their diapers all the time and will put feces everywhere and you only notice it after you've finished handling your other patient down the hall. This is a staffing issue. I enjoyed my job but it's a crazy amount of work for minimum pay. I do not condone this behavior but I understand how it happens.
3 | Zenobia Craig | 426 | 1554968407856517_1554969797856378 | This is why I will never put my parents in a home! I will sacrifice everything to take care of them myself!
4 | MarLisa Rice | 378 | 1554968407856517_1554969364523088 | If you don't want to care for the sick and elderly then FIND A NEW JOB!
5 | Gina Marie Ashby | 290 | 1554968407856517_1554974027855955 | It's the state that's at fault.. the states don't care about our elderly if they did then CNA's wouldn't have to take care of up to 16 people. Furthermore nobody wants to be a CNA anymore when you take care of a human being for $9 an hour you can go flip burgers for $13 an hour come on, all states are at fault
6 | Andrea Payne | 133 | 1554968407856517_1554975414522483 | I learned when my mother was in a nursing home that the residents who don't get visitors often are the most mistreated because no one outside staff drop in to see it or complain. Prayers for this lady and her family.  No one deserves this.
7 | Deborah Willoughby | 79 | 1554968407856517_1554987721187919 | I've been a nurse for 30 years. I think I'm qualified to say quite bluntly nobody wants his job. Next to nobody and those that do I admire you. It's hard back-breaking work with little return on your efforts. Can be very depressing and cause irritability. I'm not saying it's right. But it is what it is. They run the CNAs into the ground.
8 | JoLynn Scopelitis | 102 | 1554968407856517_1554974871189204 | This problem is huge in our country and its only going to get worse. Start by paying people a decent wage and screen people carefully. For the amount of money these places get from each patient it's horrible how they are treated. Also they are horribly understaffed. It really is an outrage. If you see abuse of any kind contact an ombudsman in your area. They can help and its a start
9 | Richard Feliciano | 63 | 1554968407856517_1554977181188973 | It's sad that our elderly aren't treated with respect. when my mom had her stroke she wasn't in a nursing home she was in a rehab center and I  found her in the same condition in her own feces on the floor and the nurses blamed it all on understaffing.. the whole time my mom was there she was weaker and weaker every day. Mind you this is supposed to be a rehab center. The center is called Cardinal Cooke on 105th and Madison in Manhattan. The place look great for people that aren't  elderly. But for the elderly the place really sucks and is full of neglect. The first week I took my mom home she was walking 25 feet everyday. When my mom was in that place. she barely walk five steps. Thank God we gave my mom to therapy she needed our selves and is much better now. We really need to watch where we put our parents and elderly because no one will take care of them like we will
10 | Sarah Smith | 32 | 1554968407856517_1555018127851545 | I worked in a nursing home facility while I was in nursing school and I saw things like this happen more often than it should unfortunately. People should really do their research on where they send their loved ones. My best advice is to check in on your family members regularly and have a active Role in their health care while they are there. Look over your family members and complain as much as you have to and make surprise visits. Don't show up the same time every day. I can only speak from my past employer and where I work now( which is a wonderful facility) the patients who are the best cares for are the ones with active families.
11 | Karen Carder-Wagner | 52 | 1554968407856517_1554973577856000 | This is horrible! Governor Christy won't sign the bill to improve the care of the elderly in NJ.  He's part of the Trump team.... what do you think is going to happen to other things like Medicaid. There will be no support.  Guess you should just pray you don't live that long!
12 | Monica Griesemer | 22 | 1554968407856517_1554985141188177 | So very sad but I know it happens often.  Taking care of the demented is a very difficult job.  Please always thank those caregivers and do what you can to make their jobs more rewarding.  Its not the McDonalds workers that need to make $15 dollars an hour, its the certified nurses aids that work in nursing homes.It's also essential that family visit often to keep track of things. They r the eyes and ears for those that are unable!
13 | Angie Watkins | 25 | 1554968407856517_1555043341182357 | I've been a nurses aide for 12years. I honestly feel bad for this woman. However dementia patients do fall they forget what they're doing and are confused, even if they've been taken to the bathroom and cared for. They can soil themselves minutes after they've just been taken care of.  We cannot be in every single patients room every five minutes it's impossible. The issue is not just this facility but the whole country. Our states say it's okay for our staff to patient ratio be what it is. There's more hard working caring stnas than there is not caring ones. Place the blame where it belongs our crappy states and bills.
14 | Jen Jones-Melton | 21 | 1554968407856517_1555005261186165 | This is what is wrong with this country. We pay athletes millions of dollars to play a game and pay people who are in charge of the well being of helpless human beings squat. We place the largest value on entertainment and self-gratification instead of on the care of living beings who cannot advocate for themselves. My Grandpa spent almost a year in a nursing home and if we, the family, didn't go in at least every other day, which we did, he would not have gotten the care and upkeep he needed. It isn't always the fault of the staff, most often they are understaffed and underpaid.  But sometimes the staff are just cruel and/or lazy. The checks and balances concerning nursing homes is a joke. We need much stricter guidelines and accountability...not to mention a revamp of pay, training and requirements for everyone working in these types of facilities.
15 | Rabab Qaissieh | 19 | 1554968407856517_1555024874517537 | Why leave your parents to a care center in the first place??? Didn't they take care of u when u were both little children? Didn't they change your diapers and cleaned your feces? Didn't they take care of u? Nursed u? Send u to school? Feed u? What kind of culture is this? What a reward u give to your parents?
16 | Von Finney | 25 | 1554968407856517_1554974194522605 | Nursing homes are like jails for the elderly. They get the same kind of treatment. The other unfortunate thing is that they pay very little for the expected work so it attracts some of worse kinds of people, to work under conditions that no kind of acceptable care is given in favor of maintaining a higher profit margin. If only more people would visit their loved ones more often, pressure their political leaders to do something about it.  People with a real passion to help others cannot afford to work in nursing homes, so they don't.
17 | Kaelin Eileen | 21 | 1554968407856517_1554981371188554 | I'm not excusing the behavior of the staff or the quality of the facility - however - this raises the issue of end of life care. If you or your family member are thus far gone, what quality of life do you have? Even in the best of environments, is this how you want to live? Completely unaware and incapable of any function? We need to consider expanding end of life care. I would much rather my family members or myself be at peace than like this.
18 | Karla Marie | 4 | 1554968407856517_1554980087855349 | So sad the way our loved ones are "cared for" in these homes. My poor Grandmother took a fall and had to be rehabed in a long term care facility. Needless to say, she lasted 1.5 months. She was not able to speak due to a tracheomty that was done before going to said facility, she had poor eyesight, and she had trouble hearing. My sister and I would visit her everyday. She wasn't able to call for help, because her call button was out of her reach. They would only check on her every two hours to see if she needed to be freshened up. Her hip had broken so she wasn't abe to use the restroom. I know she laid in her own feces for more than a "few minutes" one day we went to visit. The so called care our loved ones get while supposedly being in "the best place for them" is a crime. She passed away in the very place that was supposed to "help" her. I believe she "willed herself" to die. The thing that bothers me the most, is she was very alert to what was going on around her. She didn't suffer from alzheimers or dimentia. She was well tuned in.
19 | Sandy Torrie Higgs | 12 | 1554968407856517_1554977424522282 | When my aunt was in supposedly one of the best convalescent homes in my city, I found her lying in her own waste. I marched to the nursing station and raised heck. I told them in no uncertain terms I better not find that again. It's a shame that this happens, especially when patients pay between $4,000-$6,000 per month.
20 | Barbara Williams | 3 | 1554968407856517_1119288801474225 | This happens everywhere in nursing homes. My father had Alzheimer's and was in a nursing home for 4 years. I can't even count the number of times this happened to my dad!!  If they would actually hire more aids and nurses for these facilities then maybe just maybe this would not be such a problem.
21 | Keisha Sewell | 3 | 1554968407856517_1555034574516567 | Understaffing due to greed has caused this elderly senior to endure such horror. This is horrific. According to this report, the owner for this facility is one of the wealthiest man in New Jersey. This makes me sick because they could have done more to prevent this from occurring.
22 | Joanna Lidia Mirage | 4 | 1554968407856517_1119301168139655 | The problem is that those facilities are for profit only ! The abuse of patients equal the abuse if workers. Insane amount of work mentally and physically draining for minimum wage , nonstop stress and pressure from greedy owners is making workers focusing more on their own survival then real care for the patients. So called rehab centers will put your parents on a wheelchair in no time ! It's easier to actually taking care of person on a wheelchair then on top of the extremely hard work focusing on rehabilitation and walking them around ! Workers simply have no time for it ! Those places are hell for everyone except owners and their bank accounts! Once you work in such a place and see the madness you seriously rather terminate yourself at the old age then end up there.... this system is evil !
23 | Kellie Wilson Self | 8 | 1554968407856517_1555007601185931 | I made sure my mother had a telephone in her room. I also stopped in EVERY day on my way to work. My husband was also very good about dropping in to visit. You have to stay on top of your loved ones situation. You can't just put them in the home and then not keep up with everything. I'm an only child and worked a full time job while walking with a cane because of a hip issue. It can be done. Oh and that telephone was like 30.00 a month. A small price to pay because it literally saved her life. She was able to call me when she couldn't breathe (she was end stage COPD) and they were not paying attention to the assist light. It even got ugly a few times. But for the most part the staff knew they better walk a chalk line with that resident. Also... make the administrator give you their contact info. If you have to be awake at 3am because somebody isn't doing their job. The the administrator needs to be awake also. They will get tired of you calling and do something! Also.... Medicare.gov. Look at the ratings. They're fairly accurate. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
24 | Eileen Mari | 0 | 1554968407856517_1609386452689845 | Unfortunately this is not uncommon in nursing homes , it happened to my dad they didn't move him after surgery consequently he developed a stage four bed sore and several others , the infection caused sepsis and he passed away,It's been 6 years and I still miss him every day
25 | Eleanor Richards | 3 | 1554968407856517_1119320894804349 | Not only in New Jersey they are all unstaffed the is why I took care of my mother when she had Alzheimer's. It took 11 1/2 years away from me and my family but I have no regrets I new she was taken care of.

5 | Eddie Local | 0 | 1554908137862544_1554985511188140 | well, I will just go back in time to before they had DNA testing and take a swab of her inside cheek before she left and then do a test of the skeleton. Wait if I could go back in time I would tell her to take more gas.
6 | Stan Gilbert | 2 | 1554908137862544_1554927361193955 | That's odd WE aren't worried about how she died, she'd dead, what does it matter all these years later how or why, or even where. Leave her memory and legacy intact. Some would rather believe she died doing something she loved until it went terribly wrong, rather living abd dying of whatever on Gilligan's Island.
7 | Robin Barron | 20 | 1554908137862544_1554910547862303 | As a women Amelia Earhart would be a role model for our daughters. NEVER HILLARY! -Hillary has no concern for women and children! Wikileak emails showed that Huma and Hillary knew about Huma husband Anthony Weiner sexing with underage girls, yet did nothing: So it would not come out in the news and hurt Hillary when she was Secretary of State. Allowing Anthony Weiner to abuse girls! Hillary is no friend to females!-NEVER HILLARY!
8 | Amy Charles | 0 | 1554908137862544_1555013734518651 | Am I the only one annoyed by this? Speculation... now. All of a sudden this COULD be her... stop posting it every day until they know if it 100% IS or ISNT. Plus, (clearly these people haven't done their research) how'd they end up so far from where they were supposed to be heading? She has remains but her navigator just vanishes in to thin air?? . . Just stop already with trying to gain publicity with these false accusations! It's stupid that you'd allow an article that makes no sense, to be published!
9 | Sheldon Oots | 22 | 1554908137862544_1554935787859779 | Brian Williams has confirmed these findings, he was there.
10 | David Rutman | 7 | 1554908137862544_1554922841194407 | I will never understand why a brand of luggage was named for Amelia Earhart, who is famous for being lost
11 | Alexis Mendez | 1 | 1554908137862544_1554922957861062 | Sorry, but that can't possibly be her. She got lost 1937 and a skeleton found in 1940?? No way! :)
12 | Frank Mullins | 4 | 1554908137862544_1554921054527919 | I'm surprised nobody said she had too much information on Hillary or Trump sexually assaulted her
13 | Nick Deatherage | 2 | 1554908137862544_1554923181194373 | And Hillary just ignored her distress calls and let her die! Trump 2016!
14 | Richard Ortiz | 1 | 1554908137862544_1554953251191366 | I don't know if this is true or not little convenient that comes up during the election ain't it
15 | Jill Krynicki | 0 | 1554908137862544_1555167011169990 | Jen Byer, I thought this was interesting, given the fact that Isabella chose to dress as Amelia for Halloween this year.

The race for electoral votes is getting tighter.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Troy Parmentier | 480 | 1554882081198483_1554891121197579 | At this point there shouldn't even be a question on who to vote for, I mean really. You need your head examined if you can't see how sick and twisted the Clintons are.
2 | Katherine Kelly White | 323 | 1554882081198483_1554891584530866 | Notice how Trump followers comments are either sexist, racist or just plain vitriolic. Are these the people you want to feel powerful in your country? These are people that would be shunned in a decent society.
3 | Melchizedek Hughes | 230 | 1554882081198483_1554883234531701 | Go out and vote for Hillary! who cares about corruption, being investigated by the FBI or deleted emails? We need her so we can fight and start a war against Russia unlike Dfump! #LiberalLogic #DraftOurDaughters #ImWithHer
4 | John Nichols | 84 | 1554882081198483_1554890321197659 | She won't win Michigan.. She didn't even win it in the primary. I used to vote Democrat. But this liberal Bologna has gone to far. The whole system is corrupt. I feel partially to blame, with the way I have been voting. My Eyes üëÄ are wide open.... Take care of home first! Thats the rule we all live by. Why can't we do that when it comes to our country??
5 | Joshua Ricker | 60 | 1554882081198483_1554886917864666 | "I'm sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior of people who support Donald Trump," Clinton said last night with anger in her voice.Well.... you better get used to it. Especially if you win Tuesday. We will never accept you as our President. You and your husband are nothing but criminals and will be treated as such. You will never bring this country together because your existence in the political arena is a major reason we are divided in the first place. We will never get behind you. We will treat your proposals and ideas the same way you would treat an 8 month old fetus... we will rip them apart every time. You will go down in history as exactly what you truly are, nothing but a nasty disgusting excuse for a woman.
6 | Joshua Houchens | 62 | 1554882081198483_1554884624531562 | There is a reason the Democratic Party is corrupt. A big part of the reason for this corruption is they were founded on hate and many of those hate policies have evolved into what we see today. Most Christians are Republican not because of Donald Trump's character, but because of the Republican policies. Satan will use someone's past to distract people from what matters in order to destroy the future. Before voting, please research socialism and how it has never worked. (Many countries are currently dying and starving from it.) The current Democratic policies reflect socialism, along with all of its detrimental effects. Please pray before you vote.
7 | Regina Dear | 25 | 1554882081198483_1554898217863536 | He must be so proud..."Not all Donald Trump supporters are white supremacists, but all white supremacists appear to be Donald Trump supporters. The Ku Klux Klan gave their blessing, officially endorsing Donald Trump on the front page of their latest newspaper edition. You must be so proud, Republicans. Just today, Congressman Paul Ryan admitted he already voted for Donald Trump in his home state of Wisconsin. That‚Äôs a racist, misogynistic stink that won‚Äôt wear off in 2020, Congressman. Even if you can‚Äôt bear to say his name out loud. "...
8 | Elijah Wright | 14 | 1554882081198483_1554898881196803 | 'Tis ''tis ''tis Donald complains about poll and now there getting tighter and some cases Donald is up and now Donald is quiet on polls being rigged. Hence the reason I pay polls no attention. Get out and Vote Hillary no I don't like her, but given the other she's better.
9 | Katherine Kelly White | 18 | 1554882081198483_1554900621196629 | Republicans voting for a guy that hates them, he thinks they're LOSERS, is he right?He's never contributed to their well being with taxes, used their money like a feckin parasite now he's insulting their intelligence by assuming they don't have any. Shame Shame Shame
10 | John Sherrod | 11 | 1554882081198483_1554900751196616 | The electoral votes should not matter. It is the public vote that should count but it never has. Gore lost to Bush because of this. He won the public vote but Bush won the electoral college. Your vote doesnt mean jack.
11 | Andrew Johnson | 11 | 1554882081198483_1554903251196366 | Ok I find this heading very funny. First - make sure to vote no matter what anyone says. - now, If you give Trump all of the toss ups (best case for him--worst case for her) Hillary is 274 to 264 he still loses. With recent polling of 4 million voters in Florida (who already cast votes early) Hillary is leading in FL. Probability lessens even more for Trump - giving him all others he's only at 235 then to her (then) 303. Very slim he could pull this rabbit out of his rear. Now I'm not saying he couldn't win but if I was betting I'd bet she wins.
12 | Mike Keniley | 17 | 1554882081198483_1554899051196786 | The thought of a #WHINEYLITTLEBITCH in the White House (if he would even bother to live there) scares the hell out of me...OUR WORST NIGHTMARE! Vote your best interest and support the Middle Class...Vote for Hillary Clinton as OUR PRESIDENT!
13 | John Nichols | 3 | 1554882081198483_1554890794530945 | BS ... your own maps disagree with this nonsense ... you're doing nothing but capitulating to Trump's nonsensical claim that you people have rigged the election, thus rigging the election for him ...Journalism is about honesty, not ratings ... It's why Chuck Todd isn't a credible journalist NOR political scientist ... he is nothing more than a hack, just like his "sainted" predecessor ... he tried to say that 2012 would be razor thin, and then, when it wasn't (and it WASN'T) he insisted he was right, all along ... ZERO credibility ... NADA ...
14 | Alex Warrington | 32 | 1554882081198483_1554883181198373 | What?! NBC isn't fluffing up Hillary today?Are you guys feeling okay?
15 | Hulk Thuto | 2 | 1554882081198483_558957870895599 | I'll be starting a prayer from tomorrow till Tuesday for madam Hillary Clinton's victory...I can't imagine the powerful and important country in the world being ran by an #idiot
16 | Mariama Samateh | 2 | 1554882081198483_1204428742925479 | The race is not tight at least not in Florida were 28% of Republicans know that Trump is demented, could not stomach voting for him and are voting for Clinton. I guess the hidden voters Trump talks about are actually Republicans flipping their votes at the polls for Hillary. This is going to be a landslide for the Dems.
17 | Todd Huff | 3 | 1554882081198483_1204325882935765 | It is getting closer but close still wins it. It's sad that we, as Americans, are forced to choose between two terribly flawed candidates. Clinton has her flaws, as I am sure every politician does. Very shady, certainly questionable, not criminal until proven guilty though. Trump has somehow been able to say/do some very nasty things. It shocks me that people are so forgiving and feel that he is the type of person that should represent America. Hopefully we have better choices in four years...

Allegedly both known associates have been cultivating Trump for years to be an unwitting Russian operative, providing him with secret information about the U.S. and his many opponents in business and politics. A top CIA official revealed secret information which he viewed as "Very Serious" outlining this long standing relationship that Trump has with the Russian Government. Allegedly the Russians haveprovided Trump with hacked Emails of top U.S. government officials, loans, and quite possibly a wife. Senator Harry Reid after being made aware of this information demanded that the FBI make both Democratic and Republican members of Congress aware of this ongoing development.BREAKING NEWS: The FBI is reported to be investigating Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump in connection with two close associates of his who have close ties to Russian government officials.

19 | Silva Braga | 3 | 1554882081198483_1554893641197327 | Insanity admit accept a candidate with dozens of notes in a very serious negative certificate and more outrageous to think that will command a nation knowing that is the product of a conspiracy being the puppet together Putin, TRUMP, FBI. A demoralizing for the FBI.
20 | Walker M Jones | 8 | 1554882081198483_1554894031197288 | So trump can make fun of disable people brag about how he don't pay taxes is racist an try to lie about how he views other race of people who are non white caught saying a lot of awful stuff an this is the Republicans choice for president that's horrible.You that votes for him are terrible keep thinking your grass so green cause all those supporters seem to be all the same idiots
21 | Henry West | 1 | 1554882081198483_558857170905669 | People really need to just stop bashing the "other" candidate. Almost all the people that have read the comments here, have already decided on who they are voting for. Short of an indefensible huge bombshell of a scandal, the voters aren't going to change their minds. At this point in the election, leaving a comment on how "bad/evil" a candidate is, is just trolling for people to rally with or pick a fight with. Either way it's just pointless and even a little sad.
22 | Joe Wenal | 1 | 1554882081198483_1554893111197380 | Is it possible for anyone anymore to realize that they're wrong or they've been fooled all I ask is do your research people research huma and her background where she's from how she got here and what her other job is research Benghazi research pay for play look at the people she put in high ranking security positions with no experience that have also donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to her we used to have common sense what happened to it don't you people know a bribe or a payoff when you see it Howard Democrats okay with the fact that her foundation collected millions of dollars for Haiti relief disaster fund and promise to build a hospital and hasn't laid one single brick in years. Just take a second and Google some of this stuff Google the Muslim Refugee crisis in Paris Germany and Australia and if you guys can give me a legitimate sensible answer of why that won't happen here after it happened in all those other countries I'll vote for Hillary
23 | Elijah Wright | 2 | 1554882081198483_1554906794529345 | Ok NBC you reported 24/7 about Bill Cosby rape allegations 30-40 year old allegations and one 14 years ago that was settled out of court.But you're quiet on Donald Trump allege raping of a 13 year old girl. Why is that? So again emails not important, than a him raping a 13 year old?
24 | Davis Emeribe | 4 | 1554882081198483_1554892501197441 | This is what CNN is hidden for the people to know, hillary Clinton make bill Clinton to refuse to acknowledge his son just because the mother was a black, any black that vote for hillary Clinton is an idiot and a fool, all they needs is black votes blacks life's don't means anything to them or matters to them, how long can we be used like a peace of paper, if you are a black then think about this, refused to be used, say the change begins with me and Trump is the change and not Clinton
25 | Dan Miller | 2 | 1554882081198483_558816174243102 | We are going to see a very slight shift of states that were Pro Hillary going pro Trump including Battleground States this will be amazing to watch between now and Tuesday

2 | Tom Stowe | 2 | 1554862734533751_1554865461200145 | I'm pretty confident airport traffic will not bother me this Thanksgiving. Not unless the planes run out of fuel in my area waiting to land, because of an airplane traffic jam.

1 | James Laubhan | 134 | 1554823387871019_1554829787870379 | The office of President of the United States requires a person of certain political training, experience, and temperment for this complicated job. From the start of the 2016 Presidential race, only one candidate has had the neccessary qualifications and dedication for this post and that's Hillary Clinton. America is a great country and will continue to be so under Hillary's guidence. At least she will be a serious leader and not a joke like that other fool. Anyone who can't see that difference should join Trump on the otherside of his wall.
2 | Alan Finch | 124 | 1554823387871019_1554827784537246 | Basically Clinton gets all of her money from "donors" she doesn't make money like Trump! she just has her greedy hands out begging dictators for cash..
3 | Johnny Grigsby | 112 | 1554823387871019_1554824231204268 | A Trump victory would result in a worldwide economic collapse in a matter of hours.
4 | Charley Faulkner | 43 | 1554823387871019_1554859124534112 | Trump winning would send our economy into a free fall. I don't understand how anyone could see that as a good thing. It's like Trump supporters have a sick desire to see the world burn smh.
5 | Patrick Boyer | 61 | 1554823387871019_1554826597870698 | ANYONE WITH COMMON SENSE, 30 seconds of listening to orange jesus, can tell he is a stupid idiot.
6 | Frank Joseph Buypal | 60 | 1554823387871019_1554827887870569 | More like because of Clinton's corruption that has caught up with her. A Clinton win means years of criminal investigations by the FBI and congress that would lead to a constitutional crisis
7 | Brian O'Mara | 39 | 1554823387871019_1554832444536780 | Great news that Trump will drain the swamp in Washington DC!! We need to elect an outsider to change America once and for all!!

9 | Michael Thomas | 13 | 1554823387871019_1554842794535745 | So Wall Street is shaken by Trump.  There's something to be said about that.....and it's a good thing for the lower and middle class often exploited for Wall Street's bottom line.
10 | Michael Carabetta | 4 | 1554823387871019_1554954564524568 | Number 1, there is no proof that the market is moving because of trumps nearing victory, or hillary's upcoming prison term. This article is not based in facts it's written to push a liberal agenda. Number 2, Hillary is not allowed to hold office due to her email scandal and exposing national security secrets  18U.S.code 2071. Look it up if you think I am lying. Number 3, get your heads out of liberal news stations and do some research for yourselves. All of you that commented here did not read the article and your dumb is showing.
11 | John Potter Sr. | 3 | 1554823387871019_1554953437858014 | That's what they get for nominating a bifgot/racist to be part of the repuhgs party.

12 | Kevin McHugh | 1 | 1554823387871019_1554932721193419 | As people began to understand just how flimsy the US currency is, particularly with this administration's answer to economic woes being to fire up he presses and just print more money, they begin to understand just how close we are to a crippling inflation, they flock to other means of protecting their assets, including gold. This started LONG before Trump announced his candidacy.

15 | Jon Smith | 5 | 1554823387871019_1554843947868963 | Lol they are scared like the world is scared!!However--This election is basically over. 20 million people have already voted. They voted in early voting locations.You won't change 18 months of nasty Trump behavior or political campaigning in 6 days-- no amount of WilkieLeaks will stop this elections trajectory at this point. All that FAILED for republicans and Trump.3.5 million voters in Florida alone. Texas is setting records for early voting--double of what it has been throughout history.Fact is polls are gauging what once was! You're not going to change anybody's mind at this point. You're not gonna change those votes that were cast last week.Trump has one path to the White House and it is a slim one-- sweeping all the battleground states. That is historically unlikely.It's all over now except for the voting. The end college tally will be close to Clinton 294 to Trump 244-- 270 is needed; if Trump loses Utah, Florida, and other states that have been factored into him as leaning red-- the loss will be even greater for him.Math isn't a stong subject for Trumpanzies but it is UNAVOIDABLE at this point
16 | Chad Hamilton | 1 | 1554823387871019_1555078321178859 | People are fools to think that EITHER candidate would cause the collapse of the nation's or even worldwide economy. If it is going to happen it will happen no matter what puppet we have in the Oval office. Imo, we stand a stronger chance of that happening and a lot more with Her in office.
17 | Richard Main | 0 | 1554823387871019_1555149474505077 | Doesn't matter if Trump or Hillary wins, the smart move is gold because both of them are going to print more money and devalue the dollar and cause inflation. No one will want to invest in anything anymore because you'll be taxed to death and ostracized.
18 | Lea Andres | 0 | 1554823387871019_1554906791196012 | They should be more worried about the fact that Chelsea Clinton's father-in-law is a convicted felon! Through a series of Nigerian email scams and Ponzi schemes, Ed Mezvinsky, Chelsea Clinton‚Äôs father-in-law embezzled more than $10 million dollars. In 2001, Ed Mezvinsky was convicted of 31 (out of 69!) charges of fraud, and served five years in federal prison. His fraud charges included bank, mail, wire, as well as other offenses involving financing bogus oil development and other trade deals in Africa. But don‚Äôt think Ed doesn‚Äôt keep it in the family. In addition to his law clients and friends, he even bilked his own (now deceased) mother-in-law out of money. To date in 2015, the Fraudster still owes over $9.4 million in restitution to his victims.   No wonder you never see them at any town halls or on the campaign trail! Just imagine the shady stuff that will go on if Hillary gets elected and her in-laws have access to the White House! You know what they say, "birds of a feather, flock together"!!!

21 | Jeff Hobbs | 2 | 1554823387871019_1554842577869100 | To become a Federal agent with the FBI, they are at the top of their class in college. They are forensic scientists, scholars, PHD's, Lawyers, accountants...They know criminals when they've seen one. And as Americans, they've all taken THE oath to defend America by its enemies- foreign and domestic. They are taking a stand- not against Trump, but staging a coup against the Clinton corruption machine, with evidence, and standing behind their leader, Comey, and he's taking a stand with them. Who is with them? Are you? #ImWithTheFBI
22 | Martha Mayer | 0 | 1554823387871019_1554953584524666 | If you don't want the truth about Hillary don't read it. A Lie Named Hillary .. I oppose her because she cannot tell the truth to save her life. Any public servant who has the gall to issue a list of terms the press cannot utter, as if disposing the corpse of free will, is helplessly deluded and a petulant child. Sorry, Hillary, but no one owes you anything; especially the nation you proclaim to serve with nothing but the benevolence of blind ambition. If your candidacy cannot survive without the aid of deception, division, and the fabricated catcalls of ‚Äúsexism‚Äù to demonize your critics, then please tell us why America needs you? Better yet, please explain how you‚Äôre even worthy of the job? A leader doesn‚Äôt need pollsters, a panel of advisers, two news conferences and a room full of media drones just to announce whether or not she used an unauthorized server to conduct official government business and therefore deleted emails in an attempt to avoid prosecution. A leader would never break the law in the first place. And a leader doesn't shout, "At this point, what difference does it make" when four lives are lost in the wake of her unmitigated failure. Any self-respecting adult with an ounce of integrity would simply admit the truth. Excuse me, any self-aware child who knows the difference between right and wrong, life and death. She was thrown off the Congressional Watergate panel for lying and she hasn't stopped lying since !!!!!. And some people want her as our President - she can't  & won't even tell the Truth as Secretary of State - and remember all she has done there to pad her financial pockets and political career - That should never have begun.If I‚Äôm hiring someone to run my business, placing my future in foreign hands, I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican, a man or woman, white or black. I want the most qualified candidate whose character speaks for itself and whose ideals can stand on the merits of their own wisdom. That‚Äôs common sense. Are you going to have the audacity to tell me what I can and can‚Äôt ask; what verbiage is acceptable? If your resume and vision are truly best for the entire nation, not just one party, gender or race, either should be able to withstand the most blistering questions and exhaustive scrutiny. In fact, you should welcome any and all discourse to discredit your detractors and display your competence. A leader unites, empowers and inspires by example, not by excuses or endless blame. Tell me the national debt is a record 19 Trillion and that Barack Obama has raised it more than the first 43 presidents combined. Admit that an estimated 94 million Americans are out of the workforce, nearly 50 million are on public assistance, and that the economic recovery is a sham. Admonish Iran as a destabilizing force of Islamic radicalism that must never be mentioned in the same sentence as ‚Äúnuclear power". Recognize the reality every civilized nation has immigration laws and that American sovereignty, the safety and security of her people, supersedes any political ploy to stuff the ballot box beneath the hollow cries of racism.Yes, just like generations of legal immigrants before your candidacy, respect is given when trust is earned. If you are incapable of acknowledging simple, documented facts - solely because it‚Äôs easier to hide behind a propaganda platform that cajoles and incites an expendable public - you're not interested in solving anything, let alone serving the American people or any notion of truth. You and the likes of you are the cancer killing the country I love. You‚Äôre the lie my forefathers warned us about. Hillary Clinton has a long and inglorious history of alleged document tampering and questionable legal maneuverings.. AMERICAN VOTERS WE NEED TO KEEP HER OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.. SHE BELONGS IN JAIL - PLEASE - PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE !!!

You can't keep printing money with nothing to back it. We are $19 trillion dollars in debt. Interest rates will rise and the DOW will fall. Welcome to Economics 101.  It's inevitable and the world knows it. Stop trying to blame Trump.

1 | Tammy Weaver Owens | 831 | 1554780761208615_1554788694541155 | So it's dark and dangerous to point out Bill Clinton rape allegations but fair game to point out allegations against Trump?  Do liberals even read their own crap stories?
2 | Annie C. Galloza | 993 | 1554780761208615_1554783857874972 | The only thing that hurts HilLIARy Clinton is the TRUTH!!! She sounded like a lunatic yesterday!!! She's such a hypocrite! She spends every minute of her rallies bashing Trump, ZERO policies, and then she calls Trump dark and dangerous?! H--->Hypocrite!
3 | Rob Maynard | 598 | 1554780761208615_1554784674541557 | But didn't the DNC pay people to start fights at Trump rallies?Didnt Donna Brazile feed her debate questions so she could cheat?Doesn't she use pay for play tactics and didnt she use them to sell out the State Department to the Highest Bidder.
4 | Joey Chris | 304 | 1554780761208615_1554783821208309 | So Bill Clinton is a rapist, but Trump isn't? Where's the intelligence in Trump's supporters?
5 | Joe Barry | 215 | 1554780761208615_1554786601208031 | IF she was honest she would have started the debate with saying she was given the questions in advance of the debate. But because we all know she is NOT TRUST WORTHY, this is just 1 example of her true self, not mentioning 33,000 other acts of deception
6 | Anne Proctor | 167 | 1554780761208615_1554807757872582 | Why has no one brought up Trumps upcoming rape case of a 13 yr old with his convicted pal Epstein... Where they paid young woman to go out in the streets and find vulnerable children for them to rape and bear for fun. Trump saying Epstein is a great guy .. He loves young beautiful woman as much as I do. You all think that's ok.. Hillary Clinton may not be perfect but she certainly isn't a filthy dirty scumbag that Trump is. Now he thinks it's years later and he has a right to be a rapist of children... I'm sickened and appalled.. If Clinton did rape anyone it was an adult.. But all those woman wanted to be a part of the limelight.. These children had no idea who trump and Epstein were they were dragged and tied and abused
7 | Mary Barber Frushon | 126 | 1554780761208615_1554810227872335 | Odd that Hillary argues Donald Trump doesn't have the judgement to be president, yet she is under FBI investigation for the second time.
8 | Karen Gold | 142 | 1554780761208615_1554798477873510 | We can do this, if we stay focused. We must turn out on November 8th! Don't allow the politics to make you take your eyes off the prize. We must...üíôELECT HILLARY CLINTON PRESIDENTüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôand Send the GOP back to where they came from!!!!
9 | Monica Orozco-Zabala | 104 | 1554780761208615_1554810557872302 | As far as I know one of the candidates for the presidency of the United States will be facing rape charges in court soon. There are at least a dozen women that have come forward accusing him inappropriate sexual behavior, he went on national radio and admitted he walked into a dressing room full of teenage girls that were half naked because he owned the pageant and also heard talking about his actions when he likes a pretty woman. So in my book this man is the rapist.
10 | Denis Drahus | 68 | 1554780761208615_1554811944538830 | Bill Clinton wasn't/isn't just a rapist but Hillary aided him not being prosecuted by threatening the rape victims!! So what the hell is she pointing her finger at!!

Trump 2016!

16 | Jody Parker | 37 | 1554780761208615_1554804581206233 | Hillary Clinton until they reopen the FBI case would not pose on stage with American flags. As of recent I have not seen her giving a speech where she has not had American flags behind her. This woman is a sociopathic pandering criminal nightmare for this country. And more than resembles the personality cult that Hitler was born from
17 | Heather Wade | 36 | 1554780761208615_1554802457873112 | She was furious and that goes to show her temper and how easily she is upset. Do we really need someone who gets bothered so easily in our white house being our president and having the responsibility of our people in those hands? Hell no we do not.
18 | Amanda Murdock | 19 | 1554780761208615_1554797104540314 | I am not a Trump supporter. Neither Trump nor Bill Clinton have been convicted of rape so when Trump opponents call him a rapist and when Trump supporters call Bill Clinton a rapist it makes me glad that we have an innocent until proven guilty justice system. Not calling the women accusing them liars but just because you dislike someone and couldn't put it past them to do something so horrible it doesn't make them guilty of rape!! So the next time you call Trump or Bill Clinton a rapist just remember the men who have had their lives ruined because of being falsely convicted of rape by the testimony of a liar!
19 | James Laubhan | 28 | 1554780761208615_1554813254538699 | The office of President of the United States requires a person of certain political training, experience, and temperment for this complicated job. From the start of the 2016 Presidential race, only one candidate has had the neccessary qualifications and dedication for this post and that's Hillary Clinton. America is a great country and will continue to be so under Hillary's guidence. At least she will be a serious leader and not a joke like that other fool. Anyone who can't see that difference should join Trump on the otherside of his wall.
20 | Michael Padilla | 39 | 1554780761208615_1554798894540135 | Hillary Clinton is full of it. How does she even know that those protesters are Trump supporters? Not the Green Party (who despise her too). Or the Libertarians. Or just people like me who are undecided but never Hillary.
21 | Naomi Martinez | 11 | 1554780761208615_1554823527871005 | Hmm and Trump's court case is scheduled on December 16th for raping a 13 year old girl ü§î. No one takes these Trump supporters seriously üòÇidiots

23 | Jeff Hobbs | 15 | 1554780761208615_1554794717873886 | To become a Federal agent with the FBI, they are at the top of their class in college. They are forensic scientists, scholars, PHD's, Lawyers, accountants...They know criminals when they've seen one. And as Americans, they've all taken THE oath to defend America by its enemies- foreign and domestic. They are taking a stand- not against Trump, but staging a coup against the Clinton corruption machine, with evidence, and standing behind their leader, Comey, and he's taking a stand with them. Who is with them? Are you? #ImWithTheFBI

25 | Florence Vasilatos Zuder | 8 | 1554780761208615_902782486532100 | Alleged! And she's not! And trump has 2 rape allegations and many assult accusations! Not only has he probably done these and many fraud allegations...he's brainless!  Bill was a rhode scholar, did these consensual affairs, acts but our country was thriving. ... But he's not running for president. This very fit intelligent and talented women is! I'm with her!Trump will lose...Can't wait for him to get lost!!

2 | Jon Wilken | 260 | 1554721017881256_1554726494547375 | If we had appropriate background checks and appropriate gun control laws, these cops families wouldn't be planning funerals today. "Gun control" doesn't mean "take your guns away". It means keeping firearms out of the hands of CRIMINALS like the ones who just killed these two cops.
3 | Karen Baldwin | 110 | 1554721017881256_1554763731210318 | They will find the killers and lock them up immediately but when a black person is ambushed by the police on video the police take vacation with pay and people defend killing a innocent black person .. The truth is the truth üíØ

But I'm intelligent enough to know he didnt do it. Ok...so...white people here's a question. When cops were getting killed before Obama got in office, was it his fault then??? Just a question.
7 | Brian O'Mara | 71 | 1554721017881256_1554730044547020 | I blame the Obama Administration for not helping to stop this years deadly Police killings!! We are losing more good Police Officers this year than ever before in our history...and Obama is nowhere to be found!!
8 | Lisa Allen | 28 | 1554721017881256_1796871647250292 | They probably deserved it. They should've complied. The shooter probably feared for his life. What? This is what everyone says when a cop shoots an unarmed person but now when it's dead cops every sings a different tune. Just sayin.

Yet, I have heard, "immigrants, illegals and blacks are the problem." Hmmmm, you might want to rethink that. Most of the shootings of cops, killing and mass shootings are not from Muslims, immigrants, blacks or illegals. You see, it is the evil in one's heart that makes him/her bad, not their religion, race, or financial background. It is all a matter of the heart. Stop the ignorance and bias across America!

While Democrats' agitation is palpable, it's driven more by anger than panic at what they see as unprecedented and appalling meddling by outside forces in the election.

He is constantly rallying and packing the house. He is always having to defend himself against all the bogus allegations and the bias reporting. She is under FBI investigation, it's not a cake walk.

7 | Jill Daw Respass | 100 | 1554526701234021_1554551937898164 | NBC is nothing short of a Clinton news machine. This is the final nail in the old hags coffin. Now that Comey has finally gotten a backbone and realized that he needs to do his job perhaps now the real truth will finally be revealed. It's about time that all of the lies are misdirections stop. I for one never bought a single one of what she was trying to sell. She is a devious self serving deceitful poor excuse for a woman. The truth is always revealed.

11 | Allen Flath III | 43 | 1554526701234021_1554580661228625 | If you don't want the FBI involved in the election: don't elect a candidate being investigated by the FBI.If you don't want people accusing you of rigging elections: don't elect a candidate that rigs elections.The only outside force the Democrats should be angry with, is the voices in their heads that compelled them to elect Hillary Clinton.
12 | Ro Spez | 38 | 1554526701234021_1554551684564856 | Trump will have no problem  with getting the 270 electoral votes, just media talk!

17 | Steven Smith | 46 | 1554526701234021_1554527394567285 | Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United StatesFrom the Los Angeles Times editorial board: "The reality is that Trump has no experience whatsoever in government, interacting with the machinery of state only as a supplicant. He has shamefully little knowledge of the issues facing the country and the world, and a temperament utterly unsuited to the job. He is a racist and a bully, a demagogue. He has proposed killing the families of terrorists, a violation of international law so blatant that a former CIA director predicted that U.S. troops would refuse to carry out such an order."http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ol-donald-trump-unsuited-to-be-president-20160302-story.html

20 | Alan Brown | 9 | 1554526701234021_1944332512460953 | Outside meddling. That's rich. NBC News and other news agencies have done everything they could to help Hillary in this election. The bias in the media has never been more obvious than it has been in this election. NBC News as well as many other news agencies are nothing more than propaganda machines for the Democratic Party. Real journalism is dead. As far as the hacking is concerned, it's laughable the Democratic Party is complaining the Russians are trying to influence the election since the hacks have exposed the fact that the party itself has tried to influence the election in many unethical and illegal ways. If our so called journalists would do their jobs, we wouldn't have to find out these things from Wikileaks.
21 | Dan Miller | 24 | 1554526701234021_1554536774566347 | NBC no it is not stable the Clinton Foundation is in Desperate mode at this point. There's some of her original EC states are going to switch to Trump and she will actually lose Electoral College votes and lose the Swing Vote States because of her latest corruption investigation
22 | Mikey DaBull Lepine | 15 | 1554526701234021_1554536851233006 | Outside forces?? She's hated for being a total scumbag. Liar, cheater, manipulator..poor ones at that even.. if you want to politics, learn to lie and cheat well at least.. sheesh.
23 | Coulter Roe | 12 | 1554526701234021_1554570177896340 | To all Trump supporters out there, you can thank Hillary Clinton and Obama for the success of Operation Neptune Spear and the death of Bin Laden.

What a weak news sorce are you scared to put your big boy pants on suck it up that you where wrong and report the truth!!!! Trump100%vote
25 | Joe Abbott | 6 | 1554526701234021_1944265125801025 | The only outside force that's meddling is you. I also notice that you're not showing all of the facebook emoticons on this flim flam article. You really have zero credibility to run an advertisement like this because your phony article is an ad with no facts. It's subjective and emotional, not objective and logical. It is manipulative advertising.

3 | Vicky Fitzmaurice | 92 | 1554476141239077_1554484487904909 | He was adopted by missionary types who basically abused and abandoned him, and screwed up on getting him naturalized . And there are thousands like him
4 | Jeannie N Sartin | 70 | 1554476141239077_1554506694569355 | America created him. He was adopted, mistreated, and then abandoned by Americans. His antisocial activities are a direct product of American influence. And now they want to return him to a country he doesn't know, where he doesn't even speak the language. It's such garbage! American born citizens commit these crimes every day, should we send them to a country they don't know and don't belong to because of it? It's basically the same thing. He might have been born in another country, but it is no more his home than it would be to someone born in the US.
5 | Ronald Goff | 27 | 1554476141239077_1554493447904013 | It sounds like he had more than his 2nd and 3rd chances. How many more should he get? He obviously hasn't changed his ways.Let's get rid of a problem before it gets worse.
6 | Shannon Malcom | 16 | 1554476141239077_1554511014568923 | His adoptive parents should be penalized, not him. It's not like he snuck over here, he was brought here as a child and understandably considers this his home. My heart breaks for him. These parents weren't for - that's not his fault or the fault of his children. Sickening.
7 | Gina Lea Helwig | 36 | 1554476141239077_1554484044571620 | He's been here sinse he was 3....he's ours. He's an America.
8 | Kate Noonan | 14 | 1554476141239077_1554512067902151 | Yes, he has committed crimes. Crimes that he has been punished for. He has served his time. He was brought here at the age of 3, taken from the only country he knew at that time, and adopted. The adoptive parents didn't do what they were supposed to do,  which was get whatever documentation needed for him to become a citizen. So now, he has served his time and paid for his crimes, and he has created a beautiful family and (in my eyes) is an American. The fact that he is being deported to a country he knows NOTHING about is deplorable. My heart breaks for him and his wife, and their kids.
9 | Thisaphone Sothhiphakhak | 3 | 1554476141239077_1554553481231343 | Same thing happened to me when I was 18 I was aiding abedding marijuana misdemeanor I was driving my friend had weed. I was in the work house for a,month. I got it expunged.  20 years later ice knocked on my door shackled me put me in detention for a month, I hunger strike for 14 days. they put me in solitary its not like in the movies you don't even get a toilet its a dungeon that they pump car exhaust from the garage you don't get a bed cold dirty floor. If a serial killer kept their victims pretty much the same. All you hear is,screams from others in the same situation going insane. you have to beg for water. I'm a metal head so this is what I listen to but living it now. I  got out due to pure resilience and 5k for a sleeze ball and  lawyer and 10k bond. After they let me out they gave me my belongings in a sealed plastic bag I tried to open it ice agent threatened to shoot me said no you can't open that til you get outside sign this I looked at the paper it stated i hear by signing have received all my belongings, I couldn't leave unless I signed it. Sure enough after being escorted outside the federal building by an armed guard, I opened the bag no ID. i had two more hearings but couldn't get into court without proper ID. so one year later still stuck. I came here as a child legally refuge my father fought secret the secret war in Laos for America. He died of Brain cancer before finishing his citizenship papers when I was 13. No easy answers.
10 | Kate Steinberg | 15 | 1554476141239077_1554514151235276 | They found him because he was applying for a green card. So... if you want to become a citizen, and apply to do so legally, you'll get deported. (Keep in mind, yes he has a criminal history, but he's served his time + has untreated emotional trauma)
11 | Carlos DeLeon | 34 | 1554476141239077_1554482371238454 | He's been here since he was 3 ? He's an American. Give him some US prison time instead.
12 | Kieran 'Kiwi' Bailey | 10 | 1554476141239077_1554529774567047 | I'm still surprised that citizenship isnt somehow part of the adoption deal. Considering how much paperwork goes in to the adoption process, you would think they'd include it in.
13 | Judy Cunha | 6 | 1554476141239077_1554519634568061 | Then we blame him for having issues. This, in my opinion, is his country. Right or wrong I think he's being abused and abandoned again. Something is so wrong with this. Cruel and unusual punishment.
14 | Sarah Kattau | 7 | 1554476141239077_1554512941235397 | NBC, what an idiotic lead. The story is that this man should be a citizen. Period. Yes, he has also committed crimes, but he should not be deported for it. That shouldn't even be an OPTION. He is American.
15 | Lalaine Lambo-Jolly | 1 | 1554476141239077_1554938251192866 | Mr. Crapser, don't worry. South Korea is actually a nice country. Lots of opportunities. Look on the bright side. You can establish your English as a second language business, for instance.
16 | Vanya Schoonover | 1 | 1554476141239077_1554882971198394 | Does the system try to punish the victim?Because he is the victim in this case:brought to this country against his will,abused,neglected as a child and now being punished for not turning right?This person needs help not deportation!
17 | Andrea Witkowski Uherka | 2 | 1554476141239077_1554489534571071 | This is sad but I know it happens as it did to my cousin adopted as an infant then deported after becoming a felon and being released from prison.
18 | Torrence Moss | 3 | 1554476141239077_1554644327888925 | He is not the poster boy for American citizenship. Yes, he was abandoned by his adopted parents. Yes, the foster care system  failed him, like so many others. But that is no reason, only an excuse and poor excuse for all the bad choices he chose. He chose not to take the path of citizenship. He chose to commit crimes. He was informed when filing for a green card the consequences of criminal activity.  He could have been deported years ago and yet he was allowed to stay. He abused the priviledge and now must pay the price.
19 | Michelle Mello | 1 | 1554476141239077_1554887147864643 | If he did his time after all of his crimes he should not be penalized being sent back to Korea he's brought here as a child and adopted let him become a citizen and if he continues to disobey the law then continue putting him in prison for breaking the law
20 | Willis M Parker | 1 | 1554476141239077_1554946247858733 | Did he break our laws? Is he here legally? He should be dealt with according to our laws Then he can start over and do it right.. We all have stories where we have been down and got no pity.
21 | Lukas Yoonshik Bong | 0 | 1554476141239077_1555053734514651 | To folks that believe Adam Crapser should be deported: Please do some research first. Adam is not a felon as he didnt commit any felony. The article below might help as well. He was abused, abandoned, and had to struggle to survive from the moment he was adopted.https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/us/adam-crapser-deportation-south-korea.amp.html
22 | Chun Man Ng | 0 | 1554476141239077_1555214491165242 | He should sues the federal agency, his adoptive/foster parents and anyone else involved in him being brought over here to be abused as a child, then take the $ and goes back to South Korea to live and hopefully recover and be a good father!
23 | Tasha M. Wiggins | 0 | 1554476141239077_1554995357853822 | My problem with this story is: Americans adopted him didn't file citizenship paperwork then abandoned him to the state years later. He was a ward of the state for years and they also did not complete citizenship paperwork. Sounds like the error was doubly made on America. The solution is to send someone to a country he has not been in for over 20 years and doesn't know? That makes sense? We're not talking illegal immigrants. We're talking about people who went to another country and adopted a child and didn't fulfill their part of the contract.
24 | Joshua Rowland | 0 | 1554476141239077_1555126367840721 | Maybe he should of thought about all of that while breaking the law. He probably got into trouble again and they said enough is enough. I felt bad foe buddy until I found this out.
25 | Joe Bourguignon | 0 | 1554476141239077_1554864291200262 | Here we go again. At what age do you stop blaming your foster/adoptive parents and take responsibility for your self? Making sure you have the correct Immigration documents in-process or completed? If you do not have the Naturalization completed, you are not a citizen. If you did nothing, from the age of 21 (or 18, if you consider that the adult-age), then you share that burden of responsibility. You got caught! 'albeit almost 30 years later, but you got caught, and you are not legally authorized to remain. Time to go. IF the US CIS allows you to process your application for citizenship at this junction of time, you should be VERY grateful.
