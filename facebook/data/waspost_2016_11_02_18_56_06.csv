1 | John Bellenis | 1 | 10154795066559729_10154795176729729 | A win is a win! Barely or not. The Dems have to mobilize their base and get new voters to the polls, it's going to be close and if it means offering rides, explaining the importance, whatever it takes. . .
2 | Rafi Elsha | 3 | 10154795066559729_10154795198139729 | No matter how corrupt Clinton is the media is doing everything to get her elected. Huh corruption #Draintheswamp Obama go to work instead of campaigning for crooked Hillary with our tax money.:.;
3 | Scott Gibbs | 16 | 10154795066559729_10154795077064729 | The idea of a con-man snake-oil salesman reality TV star actually winning the presidency is so absurd that I honestly don't know how I'll react if this idiot wins the election. I'm not a fan of Hillary Clinton but, come on, this one seems like such a no-brainer.
4 | Ric Bucklew | 2 | 10154795066559729_10154795125654729 | The six toss-up states are Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, New Hampshire, Arizona, and Utah. According to NBC, Trump could win all of those and still not have enough votes to win the White House, and Trump‚Äôs victory in those states is far from a sure thing although Arizona and Utah do lean more towards Trump than Clinton.

Likely voters think Trump is more honest and trustworthy than Clinton, 46 to 38 percent.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Renita Kruger | 69 | 10154793901654729_10154793930599729 | The choice is clear: someone who used a private email server while Secretary of State or a white supremacist, racist, sexual predator, bankrupt, who will give tax breaks for the rich, doesn't believe in global warming, defrauded thousands of people, owes millions to Russia and is a ignorant lunatic!
2 | Sean Larabee | 45 | 10154793901654729_10154793968814729 | The fact that Donald Trump is seen as more honest than Hillary Clinton by an 8 percent margin defies the imagination. I have often defended the citizenry of our nation as people have attacked their intelligence, but for crying out loud what a bunch of imbecilic rubes. Trump lies about things he said 5 minutes ago, that are on video!! All the time and constantly and there are people that think he is honest?!! Defies the imagination it really does.
3 | Gabriela Arellano | 1 | 10154793901654729_10154794435549729 | The FBI should shut the f#k up and indict her after elections, if she gets to be president and they find decisive proves against her. Then the VP will assume the presidency. But launching all this news before election day influence not only who is gonna be the president, but also lots of many other official positions that can be ridiculously lean towards republicans just for FBI's loose lips.  A republican system of government has its resorts to deal with presidency vacancy. I rather follow the rules than steal from Democrats all the other official charges that are there in the ballot.
4 | Vee PM | 8 | 10154793901654729_10154793923854729 | I asked a young Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a ‚Äúmisogynist, a racist and a bigot.‚Äù Here is her answer: **  Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think. **  Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist. **  Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race. **  Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist. **  Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right. **  Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country. **  Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe? **  Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers. **  Because I fear for my family‚Äôs safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues ‚Äì which is a threat to our way of life. **  Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them. **  Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it. **  Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries. **  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.**  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success. And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary DOES than by what Trump SAYS. (Copied and pasted)
5 | Vinnie Moran | 7 | 10154793901654729_10154794041224729 | This is just complete bollocks. Are people this stupid? Or has TV news failed to cover Trump's dishonest business practices enough? The latter makes sense, although there's no denying there are an amazing number of idiots who mistake crude vulgarity for honesty. And why don't the polls include a question on how people feel about the Klu Klux Klan and white supremacists being enabled by Trump's rhetoric!
6 | Lynn Rud | 1 | 10154793901654729_10154794696389729 | Lolol..ok, then..whom did they poll? Inmates? Or the mental institutions? Because there is no way in hell people of sound mind and any semblance of intellect can say he is more "honest and trustworthy".....
7 | Kathleen Martin McGill | 1 | 10154793901654729_10154795125489729 | The GOP controls 68 out of 98 partisan state legislative chambers, 31 of 50 state governorships, the House and the Senate in Congress...and until Scalia died, the Supreme Court.  They are fighting dirty for complete control of our entire government from shore to shore.  It is not democracy - it is Republican dictatorship.  If you don't like the direction the country is headed in...blame the Republicans...they are driving.
8 | Tony Thompson | 1 | 10154793901654729_10154794527624729 | Lol.. Hilarious. Proves that some Americans have a warped sense of character and America seems to have a problem with women being strong and having power.. If Obama had said or been accused of half of the shot that trump has been accused of, u know that Hillary would be ahead in a blowout.. This is truly a melanin/gender bent society.. It's pretty crazy to watch this thing pathetically unfold.. Emails Vs lawsuits, mysogyny, racism, xenophobia etc etc.. It's amazing what type of pass trump is getting from the blind and comfortable 40%... Pretty pathetic shit!!

12 | Simon Anderson | 16 | 10154793901654729_10154793921954729 | An 8 point lead on honesty? If trumps mouth is moving, he's lying.
13 | Adrian Leung | 2 | 10154793901654729_10154794172624729 | Our education system really needs a reboot and even though Clinton has her issues, Trump is a pathological liar, who lies about his lies!
14 | John G Schickler | 3 | 10154793901654729_10154794123909729 | Shows how easily people are mislead when lies are repeated over and over. Thump has lied about everything in his life and his beliefs yet stupid people think he is honest.

With Hillary, there have been allegations of lying; with Trump, there have been videos and recordings that PROVE he is a pathological liar. November 8th will answer one question...has the American epidemic of stupidity taken over the majority of Americans? If we wake up on November 9th to a President Trump...then we will know that it has, indeed, taken over the majority. The only vaccine America has against the epidemic taking over the majority...is a vote on November 8th for Hillary Clinton. So get out there...and vote for the future of your children, for the future of ALL America...vote for Hillary Clinton. (Disclosure: I am a registered Non-Partisan voter)

24 | Joanne Cronrath Bamberger | 1 | 10154793901654729_10154794814989729 | That's because of how the media sucked up to Trump & attacked Clinton for most of campaign

Trump showed flashes of a cohesive closing argument in the final stage of a presidential campaign that is tightening with six days left.

1 | Rhonda Worley-parsley | 12 | 10154792165479729_10154792601069729 | I don't call saying that Clinton will let in 650 million people into the country "on track." I know he thinks that people like "big numbers" but it really does not take a math whiz to know that he is totally off base.
2 | Sue Carpenter Sheerer | 2 | 10154792165479729_10154793739214729 | Maybe for once the American voters ought to think beyond both of these scandals and ask yourself who has the better platform?  Do you want to give  illegal immigrants a free ride and make them US Citizens, while we can't support our own American veterans?  Do you want to risk the influx of ISIS into our country because we didn't properly Vet incoming refugees or immigrants from Muslim countries?  Do you want our jobs and companies to keep closing and going to foreign countries where labor is 1/3 or less of our costs?  Do you want the Chinese companies to continue to buy our company stocks until they own them too?  Do you want to continue to DOUBLE our national Debt every 8 years?  It is up to 20 TRILLION Dollars.  Do you want to keep adding to the already 40+% of people dependent on the government for help? Do you want to keep Obamacare until our healthcare completely collapses or no one can afford it anymore?  Do you want to continue with the corruption in the government to the point where the media protects and hides it from the people?  Do you want to make AMERICA GREAT AGAIN or do you want to sit back  and watch because of some slanderous remarks Trump made that got twisted by the media.  You have a choice - make it matter.

6 | Vinnie Moran | 2 | 10154792165479729_10154793103074729 | The thing with staying on script is - Trump knows absolutely nothing beyond the talking points in his stump speech, which he reads out like a wind-up toy.
7 | Alex Alvarado | 2 | 10154792165479729_10154792230509729 | So Donald Trump personality ... as an expert in psychologyAlberto Martin Rubin / LifederThe candidate for the US presidency by the Republican Party is analyzed by one of the most recognized American psychologists. What indicate his speeches on their way to be?Author of books such as 'intelligence applied' or 'The nature of hate', American Robert Sternberg is one of the most renowned psychologists on the international scene. specialized professor at Yale University, is famous for its many research on topics such as intelligence, creativity, life partner or success, besides being president of the American Psychological Association -APA-.In this interview, conducted by Lifeder, you'll know your views on some aspects of political life that you might like to see from the perspective of psychology.Question: Mention in your web five ways that leaders can fail, what do you think they lack the current leaders? And what is your opinion of your country?I can not speak for the Spanish particular situation, but the aspects evaluated in elections often are not those that lead to a good and successful leadership. We see this in our own country US, at this time, where the main candidate of one of the political parties shows many of the characteristic attributes of a demagogue. Leaders are better and more effective when making ethical judgments and wise, but the wise and balanced candidates tend to be less exciting and flashy.On the contrary, narcissists candidates, whose main concern in life is to love themselves and only themselves--and often are very convincing because they will say or do whatever it takes to win and get power. They do not care at all for others, so do not feel bad about deceiving. For them it is not good leadership, but rather self-improvement. Ethical principles are not important to them, as they discovered some European countries during the Second World War, and to discover in the US future""Q: It would be very beneficial to the citizens we knew distinguish an ethical leader of one narcissistic, how can we know?It is not so difficult to know if a leader is wise and ethical. The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. In the case of the United States, an individual who has broken four companies and impoverished many investors in reference to Donald Trump- it is neither wise nor ethical.The problem is that it seems that people do not care, people preferring to appeal to your emotions, fantasies, and sometimes their prejudices. It is a sad commentary on the electorate, but it is.What is especially strange in our elections is that candidates who lead -fundamentalismo Christian-evangelical voters, do not show any of the characteristics that Jesus modeled-charity, humility, concern for others, wisdom. The irony is that it seems that people who claim to value the most fundamental of Christianity attributes, not values ‚Äã‚Äãin their presidential candidates. It is as if the message of Jesus were completely lost in practice, can that much of that message is only theoretical.

9 | Danny Babcock | 2 | 10154792165479729_10154793493194729 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!Copy Paste Share!

I found that Obama wrote about Saul in his books. Hillary wrote about him in her thesis. Does any of this scare you?SPREAD THE WORD, maybe the right eyes will see this!! KNOWLEDGE IS POWER...to Hearts That Care. STOP BY, & Share & Like what is on my profile...please. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢The image attached to this, is a POWERFUL message. So please do not copy and paste.

Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! What do you see? Before you deny its not true,...How did Saul Alinsky know the U.S. was heading toward a Social State 46+ years ago? It's a good question to think about!!!Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"! Wake up and Vote for Trump, he is our only hope to rid our country of the stinking rotten corruption!Help make our country great again,....‚Ä¢‚Ä¢CLICK ON MY PROFILE, to SHARE, if you care‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

12 | Frances Scott | 3 | 10154792165479729_10154792786064729 | From Joe HallThe dam is leaking and there is no one brave enough to put their finger in the leak...and the dominoes are beginning to fall....and the House of Democrat, which is built on the sands of lies and deception, is shaking mightily....and rats are cancelling their Twitter accounts and moving their ill gotten monies out of the country....and Obama is distancing himself from Clinton, the one with whom he has been campaigning of late.....and the Green Weenie is about to spill his guts and otherwise!! Reportedly, a very good and anonymous source is saying that the email scandal, as bad as it is, is just a diversion from the Clinton Foundation whose tentacles reach far and wide in DC and across many waters....and especially with Trump in office, lots of heads are going to roll and political careers are going to be flushed and America is going to be really shocked at the dept and width of the corruption. The Clintons have almost single handedly soiled the perception of America around the world and weakened our national security and caused a Constitutional crisis all for the sake of more money and more power for them and their allies. The Good Book says that the way of the transgressor is hard.
13 | Vee PM | 2 | 10154792165479729_10154793928569729 | The Democrat Party that my grandfather supported is dead. The "new" Democrat Party leans way too far left and is corrupting America. They believe in power more than they do in service to the people who vote for them. They have proven - time after time they are corrupt. It is like a cancer, you cannot just remove a portion of it and hope for the best. The HEART of the CANCER needs to be cut out and COMPLETELY REMOVED. The Democrats have shown repeatedly - most especially in this 2016 election - that they value their ability to corrupt and control far more than they value putting AMERICA FIRST.

And certainly the swamp will not be drained....but the muck and stench will just grow worse and worse.

5 | Glenn Hassig | 0 | 10154791039519729_10154793659809729 | They are investigating an unsecured computer in a private home that could have classified emails on it originating from Hillary's personal server!!! This is a very serious issue and if true Hillary will be brought up on charges and lose her security clearance. Therefore will be removed from office! This is no small matter and the voters have every right to know.
6 | Sue Carpenter Sheerer | 0 | 10154791039519729_10154793741284729 | Maybe for once the American voters ought to think beyond both of these scandals and ask yourself who has the better platform?  Do you want to give  illegal immigrants a free ride and make them US Citizens, while we can't support our own American veterans?  Do you want to risk the influx of ISIS into our country because we didn't properly Vet incoming refugees or immigrants from Muslim countries?  Do you want our jobs and companies to keep closing and going to foreign countries where labor is 1/3 or less of our costs?  Do you want the Chinese companies to continue to buy our company stocks until they own them too?  Do you want to continue to DOUBLE our national Debt every 8 years?  It is up to 20 TRILLION Dollars.  Do you want to keep adding to the already 40+% of people dependent on the government for help? Do you want to keep Obamacare until our healthcare completely collapses or no one can afford it anymore?  Do you want to continue with the corruption in the government to the point where the media protects and hides it from the people?  Do you want to make AMERICA GREAT AGAIN or do you want to sit back  and watch because of some slanderous remarks Trump made that got twisted by the media.  You have a choice - make it matter.
7 | Donna Macfarlane | 1 | 10154791039519729_10154792290154729 | This will be life under Trump: terrifying brinksmanship with North Korea, falling victim to the manipulations of Putin, repeal and No replacement of health care for the uninsured, tax breaks for the 1 per centers, ugly home grown violence as a result of the 16 million being forcibly evicted, a shortage of labour to keep industry operating, cancelled trade agreements so no market for American products, cancelled mutual defence treaties, resulting in international instability, a coarsening of the American discourse, open season on Muslims, women, people of colour, and yes even obese people. But yeah, I guess the email protocol may be strictly observed. Look, you don't have to like Clinton, but Trump is a dangerous fascist. If Americans have a choice, and you do, bear with Clinton for 4 years and work to defeat her next election. Choosing Trump is leap into the abyss.
8 | Sue Carpenter Sheerer | 0 | 10154791039519729_10154793824089729 | Hillary supporters would stand by her even if it was announced she had murdered someone.. oh wait, she did.. Benghazi.. lest we forget. Oh, and in case you were wondering, that is how she got in this HOT email mess to begin with. While under investigation for that they found out she was using a PRIVATE, ILLEGAL server to conduct GOVERNMENT business on. (WHY, oh WHY? Hiding something?) Yes, she lied about BOTH things and now she has to answer for it. She tried to dodge and hide but the Trump Train is going to DRAIN THE SWAMP! You will see the biggest scandal unfold in American history! Why do you want to protect someone who doesn't give a shit about you and your safety? Bet you'd feel differently if it was your kids who died at her hands.

12 | Rode Tmcil | 3 | 10154791039519729_10154791463184729 | The FBI should be investigating Donald Trump and his criminal actions! Not Hillary! Hillary Clinton for president!
13 | Richard Klein | 3 | 10154791039519729_10154791201084729 | It's easy to say you are all for fiscal responsibility, free markets, and everything the republicans promise. Republicans all claim they know how economics works. To them it means to give away for pretty much free public and, private lands to Corporate America along with the people‚Äôs personal wealth. What makes it really bad is Corporate America demands that the economy works this way or else they are not going to participate. Notice the stock market always tanks every time there is good news for Trump? This is what Republicans bring to our lives. Complete uncertainty and, disorder. It makes it really hard for people like the democrats who are trying to work economic prosperity for the country from the middle class out. We need to be Stronger Together with Hillary Clinton to stop republicans from throwing our good programs out the window for their own personal gain. Hillary Clinton is really good about getting some of this money back and, re-distributing this money around the world to places that need it. Hillary Clinton knows what she is doing and, has easily defeated republicans on everything they have thrown at her. Hillary Clinton is going to be our next President. Let‚Äôs all unite together democrats, independence and, republicans so, that we can grow the economy from the middle class out. Hillary Clinton will stop Corporate America from refusing to invest in America. Look! you can‚Äôt pull your money out of the economy so, why should Corporate America be allowed too. You are 100% invested in the economy rather you know it or, not. It just makes economic sense that you see we are all in this together. This is the only way prosperity at its best can work for us all. Are you going to just sit there and, watch your children‚Äôs futures be stripped and, drained while Corporate America continues to make a fortune off of financial markets and, never passing one dime to main street? Republicans seem to take great pride in themselves not to improve anything and, only make things worse. Everybody knows about Obamacare and, republicans refusal to make it better. Obamacare sat a good standard for medical healthcare insurance for all of us. You can‚Äôt be sold junk medical healthcare insurance anymore. It is not the failure that republicans claim. This is the breakdown of Obamacare / ACA for 2017. 16% of people who get their healthcare through the market place may be affected by a rate increase. Less than 1.5 million people may want to change to another plan or, pay the increase. Now consider the fact that there will be over 20 million people getting their healthcare through the Obamacare / ACA. How is that a complete failure? Over the fact that it sat a good standard for good healthcare compared to buying below standard medical healthcare with junk medical insurance. Obamacare / ACA is by no means a failure.  Hillary will stop republicans from defunding all the good America has to offer and, build the economy from the middle class out. I am sick and tired of watching Republicans defund our services only to liquidate the assets and, give these funds away to someone from a foreign country or, off shore. Hillary Clinton is wise and will put a stop to these republican renegade ideas and, put America‚Äôs wealth back into to the pockets of the middle class. That's why I'm standing Stronger Together with Hillary Clinton and, the Democrats. (The party of empathy)

Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! What do you see? Before you deny its not true,...How did Saul Alinsky know the U.S. was heading toward a Social State 46+ years ago? It's a good question to think about!!!Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"! Wake up and Vote for Trump, he is our only hope to rid our country of the stinking rotten corruption!Help make our country great again,....‚Ä¢‚Ä¢CLICK ON MY PROFILE, to SHARE, if you care‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

I love I'm with the party of beautiful caring people with a great convention and, historical speeches. I fear nothing. I don‚Äôt have near the women problem Trump has. The sky is not falling. Yes, I favor the democrat issues. My healthcare is good and, I feel great. I selected my own primary care doctor and, gained many other essential things.          So, if you think some of Trump‚Äôs voters are going to stop us from being Stronger Together, you are so wrong! We don‚Äôt mean any ill feelings. I realize some may have gotten a grudge. But, that‚Äôs you and, not us. Democrats did not   try to default on the nation‚Äôs debt. The debt is a serious matter. This tells me the republicans do not have educated thinkers to run this country. The country could have been seriously harmed or, destroyed.          The Republicans will ride any wave that comes their way if it will grab them power, including electing this habitual sexist liar Trump for President. Republicans think they don‚Äôt have to take any responsibility for anything no matter how heinous it is. Republicans may have another 8 years to re-think their, ‚ÄúI got an axe to grind!‚Äù and their, ‚Äúhate‚Äù behavior. The world is much better and, bigger than what the republicans can see. So, I don‚Äôt expect them to see, Stronger Together with her is truly the only place for me.

Trump chicken out and, choked big time! ‚ÄúSome art of the deal!‚Äù that was. I‚Äôd like to ask his supporters, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs is that Wall? Iowa farms even think the rest of the world is going too bent over for Trump too. Once Trump breaks all these trade deals with them by United States will see who‚Äôs bending over. Iowa farms don‚Äôt even understand why corn is being sold for $3.10 / bushel today. The republicans here in Iowa can‚Äôt even get the Iowa farms a good deal for their corn. Wait until Trump breaks these trade deals. If the Iowa farmer thinks it costs them more to grow corn now wait until the world starts buying all their corn from Brazil. When was the last time Iowa corn was sold for $1.00 or, $2.00 / bushel? No foreign country is going to bend over like Trump says they are. As a matter of fact everybody is going to be boycotting the U.S.A. trade like they are doing Trump hotels now. Who does Trump think he was insulting? The very ethnic people he thinks is going to bend over for him here in the U.S.A. Just because these peoples don‚Äôt live here in the U.S.A. they are the same peoples that was he slamming here in America. Trump supporters might be fooled but, nobody else in the world is. I can assure you that. Australia and a number of other countries parliaments have passed bills to dis-endorse Trump. It was passed unanimously by both sides of parliament in Australia. Not a single vote against it. Not one!British parliament long ago pass a law especially for Trump  that he can't put one foot on her Majesty sovereign soul without consent/approval first and monitoring by them. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-revolting-slug-australia-nsw-parliament-sexual-assault-jeremy-buckingham-a7358856.htmlBecause of his bullying, intimidating, threatening that Scottish farmer that he finally decided to just bulldoze his land because he wouldn't sell.

My wife just got a letter from her health insurance company announcing that her rates were skyrocketing -- up more than 200% for next year. Most people would just clean their underwear and call their insurance company after the election. We called the next day and learned that the news wasn't nearly as bad. She could get slightly better coverage from her current company for just slightly more.Why would the insurance company send out the most dire letter possible unless they wanted to frighten people and maybe get them to vote against Hillary? (Not that she actually DESERVES anyone's vote, but I hate unfairness! Insurance companies HATE Obamacare and are probably mostly Republican.)

But yeah, I guess the email protocol may be strictly observed. Look, you don't have to like Clinton, but Trump is a dangerous fascist. If Americans have a choice, and you do, bear with Clinton for 4 years and work to defeat her next election. Choosing Trump is leap into the abyss.

Once upon a time, dear Albert, there was a very strange man, who lived in our great nation - Oh, Granma' is it the story about the lunie Trump, who never was triumphant, who has a deplorable hairdue, who always put his foot in the spinach and who had a memory like an invisible swiss cheese? Yes, Albert - that him. Oh, Grannie please tell the story about how this conceited lunie made a complete fool of himself when he tried to make advances on a Mexican nonne.HaHaHa - yeah that is a damn grand story, eah Albert. Here we go:See, Trump has always been dreaming about jump‚Äôin a Mexican nun. He thinks that experience most definitely must be second to none! So on a trip to Mexico he visited a monastery and found the most adoring innocent looking beauty and invited her to join him on a trip across Sahara on a camel. She agreed.On the third day the camel suddenly dropped dead without warning. After dusting themselves off, the nun and Trump surveyed their situation. After a short period of silence, Trump spoke. "Well, this looks pretty grim, eah?." "I know, Mr. Trump." "In fact, I don't think it likely that we can survive more than a day or two." "I agree." "Since we are unlikely to make it out of here alive, would you do something for me, Trump begged?" "Anything Mr. Trump." "I have never seen a woman's breasts and I was wondering if I might see yours." "Well, under the circumstances I don't see that it would do any harm." The nun opened her habit and Trump enjoyed the sight of her shapely breasts, commenting frequently on their beauty. "Would you mind if I touched them?" She consented and he fondled them for several minutes. "Mr. Trump, could I ask something of you?" "Yes, Trump replied?" "I have never seen a man's penis. Could I see yours?" "I supposed that would be OK," Trump and pulled out some dwarf eal-looking creature. "Oh Mr. Trump, may I touch it?" Trump consented straight away and after a few minutes of fondling he was sporting an erection. "Oh dear, Maria, you know that if I insert my penis in the right place, it can give life." "Is that really true Mr. Trump?" "Yes, indeed, Maria." "Then why the fuck don't you stick it up that camel's ass and lets get the hell out of here."

But since the 2016 election is all about extremes, on the final night of the month there were multiple last-minute ‚ÄúOctober surprises‚Äù about Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia, with varying levels of sexiness (we mean that metaphorically and, sadly, literally).While accusing Comey of potentially breaking the law on Sunday night, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid alleged that the FBI is sitting on ‚Äúexplosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.‚Äù Reid has been known to make wild accusations close to an election, but apparently this one was (sort of) true. According to the New York Times, the FBI spent much of the summer investigating the many allegations regarding Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia. The wide-reaching probe, which is reportedly ongoing, looked at his advisers, his financial activities, and the hack of Democratic officials, but so far it has not turned up proof that Trump is in cahoots with Vladimir Putin. Per the Times:Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.Intelligence sources told the Times that Trump aides‚Äô alleged Russian affiliations are what initially prompted them to open the investigation. Part of the probe involves former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who worked for Ukrainian president and Putin ally Viktor Yanukovych before he was ousted in 2014. Manafort resigned in August amid allegations that he helped Ukraine‚Äôs pro-Russian political party lobby the U.S. government without disclosing his role, which is illegal. Hours before the Times piece was published, NBC News reported that the FBI is conducting a ‚Äúpreliminary inquiry‚Äù into Manafort‚Äôs overseas business activities, but it has ‚Äúnot blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation.‚ÄùManafort has maintained that he has never had ties to Putin or his government, and in a statement to NBC he dismissed the allegations as ‚ÄúDemocratic propaganda.‚Äù ‚ÄúNone of it is true,‚Äù he said of NBC‚Äôs report. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no investigation going on by the FBI that I‚Äôm aware of.‚ÄùIn August and September, congressional leaders were briefed on potential financial ties between Russia and people in Trump‚Äôs orbit, according to the Times. That discussion included a computer back channel between the Trump Organization and Russia‚Äôs Alfa Bank. In one of the night‚Äôs other big reveals, Slate‚Äôs Franklin Foer posted a complex report on how computer scientists investigating Russia‚Äôs alleged election hacking accidentally discovered the link between Trump‚Äôs business and one of Russia‚Äôs largest banks.Foer‚Äôs conclusion was that it‚Äôs unclear why servers at Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization were communicating with each other, ‚Äúbut it deserves further explanation.‚Äù However, the Times threw cold water on the story, reporting, ‚ÄúThe F.B.I. ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.‚ÄùThe Trump campaign and Alfa Bank denied having any business dealings. The bank said it had hired the cybersecurity company Mandiant, and their ‚Äúworking hypothesis‚Äù is that the activity was caused by ‚Äúa spam attack targeted at Alfa Bank by a marketing server, which triggered security software.If mysterious functions of the domain name system do not qualify as a thrilling October surprise, Mother Jones‚Äôs Monday night report on spies and Russian sabotage more than makes up for it. David Corn talked to a former senior intelligence officer who specialized in Russian counterintelligence for a Western country. The former spy says he recently gave the FBI memos, based on his talks with Russian sources, that claim the Russians have been grooming Trump for years. Per Mother Jones:The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer‚Äôs conversations with Russian sources, noted, ‚ÄúRussian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.‚Äù It maintained that Trump ‚Äúand his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.‚Äù It claimed that Russian intelligence had ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù Trump during his visits to Moscow and could ‚Äúblackmail him.‚Äù It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on ‚Äúbugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.‚ÄùThe ex-spy says the FBI asked him for more information in August, and he‚Äôs continued to share information with the bureau. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,‚Äù he says.An even more sensational rumor sprung from this report as journalists speculated on how Trump may have been ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù:Monday‚Äôs various revelations fed into a narrative the Clinton campaign and Democratic allies had been pushing hard all day: that she is the victim of a ‚Äúblatant double standard‚Äù when it comes to FBI disclosures. Comey provided extensive updates on the Clinton email investigation, yet he refused to confirm that the FBI was investigating Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia during testimony before Congress in September. Furthermore, on Monday, CNBC reported that Comey was so sensitive about revealing information that could influence the election that he successfully argued against including the FBI in a statement that said the ‚ÄúU.S. intelligence community‚Äù was confident that Russia was behind the hacks of Democratic officials.Speaking of the hacks, the Times says that federal investigators now believe Russia‚Äôs goal was ‚Äúto disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine America‚Äôs standing in the world more broadly,‚Äù not to aid Trump‚Äôs campaign. That sparked disagreement over whether there‚Äôs any difference between the two goals.Others say there‚Äôs already ample reason to be concerned about Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia ‚Äî and it has nothing to do with claims made by shadowy intelligence sources. Vox‚Äôs Matt Yglesias said he‚Äôs more interested in Trump‚Äôs stated policies toward Russia than theories about what motivated them.Talking Points Memo‚Äôs Josh Marshall agreed, saying Trump‚Äôs relationship with Russia should be a huge issue for voters, even without Monday night‚Äôs barrage of allegations:‚Ä¶ if Russia has coopted or cultivated or compromised Trump that is a threat of the highest order. I can‚Äôt go on the word of an unnamed retired spy whose identity we don‚Äôt know, whose motives we can‚Äôt interrogate and whose evidence we can‚Äôt see. But I don‚Äôt think I need additional evidence. What‚Äôs been in plain sight for weeks, actually months, is more than enough to ring every alarm bell. And yet, with all the hints and arch remarks about Russia, the alarms have barely been rung.TRUMP IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN DECADES, THAT HAS NOT RELEASED HIS TAXES.

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother‚Äôs Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! What do you see? Before you deny its not true,...How did Saul Alinsky know the U.S. was heading toward a Social State 46+ years ago? It's a good question to think about!!!Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"!

Will enough voters who don't think he's got what it takes to be a good president decide they would still like to make him president?

2 | Malcolm Mandel | 5 | 10154790900419729_10154792095714729 | Not One Former PresidentWill Endorse Trump ¬© 2016         If that doesn‚Äôt tell you something        you may not be as smart as you think you are.Samuel Ktheblacksilentmajority   SMIn recent years, Republicans and Democrats haven‚Äôt agreed on much. But there‚Äôs one area where every living, former president, Republican and Democrat, have found something to agree on. They all agree that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president of the United States.Those former presidents include Carter, Bush Sr., Clinton, and Bush Jr. The current president, Barack Obama, has also weighed in, and he thinks Trump is unqualified to lead this great country as well. If anyone understands the demands of the presidency and what it takes, it‚Äôs a former president.These men have been there and done that. They know what the job entails, and all agree Donald Trump would be an embarrassment and a disaster as president. Moreover, knowing Trump‚Äôs history, he would use the presidency to line his pockets.That said, read the following comments on those seeking your vote:Jimmy Carter on Hillary Clinton:‚ÄúI've known Hillary for decades ‚Äî and her record as a public servant is superb. In 1977, I appointed her to the board of the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a nonprofit that provides legal assistance to Americans in need ‚Äî she went on to become the first woman to chair the board. Over her tenure, funding for the LSC tripled, allowing the organization to expand legal aid to every congressional district, and handle 1.5 million cases for poor clients each year. As First Lady, Clinton continued to advocate for legal services funding.‚ÄùMitt Romney on Trump:‚ÄúIf we make improvident choices, the bright horizon I foresee will never materialize. Let me put it plainly, if we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.‚ÄúA few examples: His proposed 35% tariff-like penalties would instigate a trade war that would raise prices for consumers, kill export jobs, and lead entrepreneurs and businesses to flee America. ‚ÄúHis tax plan, in combination with his refusal to reform entitlements and to honestly address spending would balloon the deficit and the national debt. So even as Donald Trump has offered very few specific economic plans, what little he has said is enough to know that he would be very bad for American workers and for American families.‚ÄúBut wait, you say, isn't he a huge business success that knows what he's talking about? No he isn't. His bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who worked for them. He inherited his business, he didn't create it. And what ever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there's Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks, and Trump Mortgage? A business genius he is not.‚ÄùMichelle Obama on Trump:‚ÄúIf a candidate is erratic and threatening; if a candidate traffics in prejudice, fears and lies on the campaign trail; if a candidate thinks that not paying taxes makes you smart, or that it‚Äôs good business when people lose their homes; if a candidate regularly and flippantly makes cruel and insulting comments about women, about how we look, how we act ‚Äî well, sadly, that‚Äôs who that candidate really is,‚Äù Mrs. Obama told an audience of mostly students at La Salle University in Philadelphia. ‚ÄúThat is the kind of president they will be.‚ÄùTrump‚Äôs appeal is really not about him; it‚Äôs about bigots and their desireisn‚Äôt based on his competence or lack thereof. It‚Äôs based largely on racial prejudice. It‚Äôs based on the racial prejudice Republicans have stoked throughout Pres. Obama‚Äôs terms, and it‚Äôs based on a prejudice that‚Äôs aimed at others who are not white.In exchange for making bigots feel ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù Trump supporters have shown they will tolerate even the most gutter, degenerate, juvenile, and sexually abusive behavior from Trump towards women. On November 8, the majority of decent Americans of all colors can reject all the divisions that Trump represents.
3 | Donna Macfarlane | 3 | 10154790900419729_10154792242439729 | This will be life under Trump: terrifying brinksmanship with North Korea, falling victim to the manipulations of Putin, repeal and No replacement of health care for the uninsured, tax breaks for the 1 per centers, ugly home grown violence as a result of the 16 million being forcibly evicted, a shortage of labour to keep industry operating, cancelled trade agreements so no market for American products, cancelled mutual defence treaties, resulting in international instability, a coarsening of the American discourse, open season on Muslims, women, people of colour, and yes even obese people. But yeah, I guess the email protocol may be strictly observed. Look, you don't have to like Clinton, but Trump is a dangerous fascist. If Americans have a choice, and you do, bear with Clinton for 4 years and work to defeat her next election. Choosing Trump is leap into the abyss.
4 | Fran Smith | 3 | 10154790900419729_10154791036339729 | If America chooses this Fascist Trump, then they will be dishonoring all women and men who have fought and died for Democracy.

6 | Sue Carpenter Sheerer | 0 | 10154790900419729_10154793741519729 | Maybe for once the American voters ought to think beyond both of these scandals and ask yourself who has the better platform?  Do you want to give  illegal immigrants a free ride and make them US Citizens, while we can't support our own American veterans?  Do you want to risk the influx of ISIS into our country because we didn't properly Vet incoming refugees or immigrants from Muslim countries?  Do you want our jobs and companies to keep closing and going to foreign countries where labor is 1/3 or less of our costs?  Do you want the Chinese companies to continue to buy our company stocks until they own them too?  Do you want to continue to DOUBLE our national Debt every 8 years?  It is up to 20 TRILLION Dollars.  Do you want to keep adding to the already 40+% of people dependent on the government for help? Do you want to keep Obamacare until our healthcare completely collapses or no one can afford it anymore?  Do you want to continue with the corruption in the government to the point where the media protects and hides it from the people?  Do you want to make AMERICA GREAT AGAIN or do you want to sit back  and watch because of some slanderous remarks Trump made that got twisted by the media.  You have a choice - make it matter.

If another person was behind an event like that they would have called it performing an act of terrorism and the victims of that day should press charges and sue for damages. Hillary Clinton is a criminal and will not help you unless you are paying her or she is paying you to commit a crime.

Benghazi.. lest we forget. Oh, and in case you were wondering, that is how she got in this HOT email mess to begin with. While under investigation for that they found out she was using a PRIVATE, ILLEGAL server to conduct GOVERNMENT business on. (WHY, oh WHY? Hiding something?) Yes, she lied about BOTH things and now she has to answer for it. She tried to dodge and hide but the Trump Train is going to DRAIN THE SWAMP! You will see the biggest scandal unfold in American history! Why do you want to protect someone who doesn't give a shit about you and your safety?

21 | Rebecca Laskey | 1 | 10154790900419729_10154792135534729 | PUTIN‚ÄôS PUPPET!  ‚ÄúOCTOBER SURPRISE‚Äù REVEALS FBI IS PROBING TRUMP AND HIS AIDES‚Äô RUSSIAN TIES:The month of October gave us multiple election shockers, from the Donald Trump Access Hollywood video to FBI director James Comey‚Äôs announcement on Friday that there are more Hillary Clinton emails under investigation ‚Äî and they involve none other than Anthony Weiner. But since the 2016 election is all about extremes, on the final night of the month there were multiple last-minute ‚ÄúOctober surprises‚Äù about Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia, with varying levels of sexiness (we mean that metaphorically and, sadly, literally).While accusing Comey of potentially breaking the law on Sunday night, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid alleged that the FBI is sitting on ‚Äúexplosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.‚Äù Reid has been known to make wild accusations close to an election, but apparently this one was (sort of) true. According to the New York Times, the FBI spent much of the summer investigating the many allegations regarding Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia. The wide-reaching probe, which is reportedly ongoing, looked at his advisers, his financial activities, and the hack of Democratic officials, but so far it has not turned up proof that Trump is in cahoots with Vladimir Putin. Per the Times:Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.Intelligence sources told the Times that Trump aides‚Äô alleged Russian affiliations are what initially prompted them to open the investigation. Part of the probe involves former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who worked for Ukrainian president and Putin ally Viktor Yanukovych before he was ousted in 2014. Manafort resigned in August amid allegations that he helped Ukraine‚Äôs pro-Russian political party lobby the U.S. government without disclosing his role, which is illegal. Hours before the Times piece was published, NBC News reported that the FBI is conducting a ‚Äúpreliminary inquiry‚Äù into Manafort‚Äôs overseas business activities, but it has ‚Äúnot blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation.‚ÄùManafort has maintained that he has never had ties to Putin or his government, and in a statement to NBC he dismissed the allegations as ‚ÄúDemocratic propaganda.‚Äù ‚ÄúNone of it is true,‚Äù he said of NBC‚Äôs report. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no investigation going on by the FBI that I‚Äôm aware of.‚ÄùIn August and September, congressional leaders were briefed on potential financial ties between Russia and people in Trump‚Äôs orbit, according to the Times. That discussion included a computer back channel between the Trump Organization and Russia‚Äôs Alfa Bank. In one of the night‚Äôs other big reveals, Slate‚Äôs Franklin Foer posted a complex report on how computer scientists investigating Russia‚Äôs alleged election hacking accidentally discovered the link between Trump‚Äôs business and one of Russia‚Äôs largest banks.Foer‚Äôs conclusion was that it‚Äôs unclear why servers at Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization were communicating with each other, ‚Äúbut it deserves further explanation.‚Äù However, the Times threw cold water on the story, reporting, ‚ÄúThe F.B.I. ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.‚ÄùThe Trump campaign and Alfa Bank denied having any business dealings. The bank said it had hired the cybersecurity company Mandiant, and their ‚Äúworking hypothesis‚Äù is that the activity was caused by ‚Äúa spam attack targeted at Alfa Bank by a marketing server, which triggered security software.If mysterious functions of the domain name system do not qualify as a thrilling October surprise, Mother Jones‚Äôs Monday night report on spies and Russian sabotage more than makes up for it. David Corn talked to a former senior intelligence officer who specialized in Russian counterintelligence for a Western country. The former spy says he recently gave the FBI memos, based on his talks with Russian sources, that claim the Russians have been grooming Trump for years. Per Mother Jones:The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer‚Äôs conversations with Russian sources, noted, ‚ÄúRussian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.‚Äù It maintained that Trump ‚Äúand his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.‚Äù It claimed that Russian intelligence had ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù Trump during his visits to Moscow and could ‚Äúblackmail him.‚Äù It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on ‚Äúbugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.‚ÄùThe ex-spy says the FBI asked him for more information in August, and he‚Äôs continued to share information with the bureau. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,‚Äù he says.An even more sensational rumor sprung from this report as journalists speculated on how Trump may have been ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù:Monday‚Äôs various revelations fed into a narrative the Clinton campaign and Democratic allies had been pushing hard all day: that she is the victim of a ‚Äúblatant double standard‚Äù when it comes to FBI disclosures. Comey provided extensive updates on the Clinton email investigation, yet he refused to confirm that the FBI was investigating Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia during testimony before Congress in September. Furthermore, on Monday, CNBC reported that Comey was so sensitive about revealing information that could influence the election that he successfully argued against including the FBI in a statement that said the ‚ÄúU.S. intelligence community‚Äù was confident that Russia was behind the hacks of Democratic officials.Speaking of the hacks, the Times says that federal investigators now believe Russia‚Äôs goal was ‚Äúto disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine America‚Äôs standing in the world more broadly,‚Äù not to aid Trump‚Äôs campaign. That sparked disagreement over whether there‚Äôs any difference between the two goals.Others say there‚Äôs already ample reason to be concerned about Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia ‚Äî and it has nothing to do with claims made by shadowy intelligence sources. Vox‚Äôs Matt Yglesias said he‚Äôs more interested in Trump‚Äôs stated policies toward Russia than theories about what motivated them.Talking Points Memo‚Äôs Josh Marshall agreed, saying Trump‚Äôs relationship with Russia should be a huge issue for voters, even without Monday night‚Äôs barrage of allegations:‚Ä¶ if Russia has coopted or cultivated or compromised Trump that is a threat of the highest order. I can‚Äôt go on the word of an unnamed retired spy whose identity we don‚Äôt know, whose motives we can‚Äôt interrogate and whose evidence we can‚Äôt see. But I don‚Äôt think I need additional evidence. What‚Äôs been in plain sight for weeks, actually months, is more than enough to ring every alarm bell. And yet, with all the hints and arch remarks about Russia, the alarms have barely been rung.TRUMP IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN DECADES, THAT HAS NOT RELEASED HIS TAXES.

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother‚Äôs Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

1 | Jack Carrenard | 7 | 10154790454984729_10154790663964729 | Director Comey is in cahoots with House Republicans to undermine the electoral process. The real question should be What did the Director know? And when did he know it? It turns out that the FBI knew for weeks about this new batch of emails. Comey waited until now to release the news so as to inflict as much damage to the Clinton campaign as possible. When told by his subordinates about deep troubling ties between the Russian Security Services and the Trump campaign, he refuses to publicize it for fear of hurting Trump's chances at the polls. DOUBLE STANDARD.

I think CO is a toss up right now)... but what this means is that the red candidate can get the pro verbal 'inside stright' of the big battle ground states and still lose-- which to me is astounding... Clinton campaign thinks they are going to get over 300.....
3 | Dven Hologram | 0 | 10154790454984729_10154793817519729 | "Don't blame me. I voted for Bernie Sanders" - if Sanders were not edged out by the likes of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Donna Brazile and the media collusion against him and the disenfranchisement of independent voters from partaking in a Primary Season they as taxpayers have helped fund....Then this wouldn't be a "close race". The primary polling suggested it all along so stop acting gobsmacked over the fact Clinton is barely staying afloat in the toilet of American politics next to a fascist like Trump. If Sanders were permitted the candidacy - he'd have won handily over Trump and we'd be all the better for it. And sure, you can say "But he didn't win"....to which I respond "But Clinton is still barely afloat"

22 | Rebecca Laskey | 0 | 10154790454984729_10154792137564729 | PUTIN‚ÄôS PUPPET!  ‚ÄúOCTOBER SURPRISE‚Äù REVEALS FBI IS PROBING TRUMP AND HIS AIDES‚Äô RUSSIAN TIES:The month of October gave us multiple election shockers, from the Donald Trump Access Hollywood video to FBI director James Comey‚Äôs announcement on Friday that there are more Hillary Clinton emails under investigation ‚Äî and they involve none other than Anthony Weiner. But since the 2016 election is all about extremes, on the final night of the month there were multiple last-minute ‚ÄúOctober surprises‚Äù about Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia, with varying levels of sexiness (we mean that metaphorically and, sadly, literally).While accusing Comey of potentially breaking the law on Sunday night, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid alleged that the FBI is sitting on ‚Äúexplosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.‚Äù Reid has been known to make wild accusations close to an election, but apparently this one was (sort of) true. According to the New York Times, the FBI spent much of the summer investigating the many allegations regarding Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia. The wide-reaching probe, which is reportedly ongoing, looked at his advisers, his financial activities, and the hack of Democratic officials, but so far it has not turned up proof that Trump is in cahoots with Vladimir Putin. Per the Times:Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.Intelligence sources told the Times that Trump aides‚Äô alleged Russian affiliations are what initially prompted them to open the investigation. Part of the probe involves former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who worked for Ukrainian president and Putin ally Viktor Yanukovych before he was ousted in 2014. Manafort resigned in August amid allegations that he helped Ukraine‚Äôs pro-Russian political party lobby the U.S. government without disclosing his role, which is illegal. Hours before the Times piece was published, NBC News reported that the FBI is conducting a ‚Äúpreliminary inquiry‚Äù into Manafort‚Äôs overseas business activities, but it has ‚Äúnot blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation.‚ÄùManafort has maintained that he has never had ties to Putin or his government, and in a statement to NBC he dismissed the allegations as ‚ÄúDemocratic propaganda.‚Äù ‚ÄúNone of it is true,‚Äù he said of NBC‚Äôs report. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no investigation going on by the FBI that I‚Äôm aware of.‚ÄùIn August and September, congressional leaders were briefed on potential financial ties between Russia and people in Trump‚Äôs orbit, according to the Times. That discussion included a computer back channel between the Trump Organization and Russia‚Äôs Alfa Bank. In one of the night‚Äôs other big reveals, Slate‚Äôs Franklin Foer posted a complex report on how computer scientists investigating Russia‚Äôs alleged election hacking accidentally discovered the link between Trump‚Äôs business and one of Russia‚Äôs largest banks.Foer‚Äôs conclusion was that it‚Äôs unclear why servers at Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization were communicating with each other, ‚Äúbut it deserves further explanation.‚Äù However, the Times threw cold water on the story, reporting, ‚ÄúThe F.B.I. ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.‚ÄùThe Trump campaign and Alfa Bank denied having any business dealings. The bank said it had hired the cybersecurity company Mandiant, and their ‚Äúworking hypothesis‚Äù is that the activity was caused by ‚Äúa spam attack targeted at Alfa Bank by a marketing server, which triggered security software.If mysterious functions of the domain name system do not qualify as a thrilling October surprise, Mother Jones‚Äôs Monday night report on spies and Russian sabotage more than makes up for it. David Corn talked to a former senior intelligence officer who specialized in Russian counterintelligence for a Western country. The former spy says he recently gave the FBI memos, based on his talks with Russian sources, that claim the Russians have been grooming Trump for years. Per Mother Jones:The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer‚Äôs conversations with Russian sources, noted, ‚ÄúRussian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.‚Äù It maintained that Trump ‚Äúand his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.‚Äù It claimed that Russian intelligence had ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù Trump during his visits to Moscow and could ‚Äúblackmail him.‚Äù It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on ‚Äúbugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.‚ÄùThe ex-spy says the FBI asked him for more information in August, and he‚Äôs continued to share information with the bureau. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,‚Äù he says.An even more sensational rumor sprung from this report as journalists speculated on how Trump may have been ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù:Monday‚Äôs various revelations fed into a narrative the Clinton campaign and Democratic allies had been pushing hard all day: that she is the victim of a ‚Äúblatant double standard‚Äù when it comes to FBI disclosures. Comey provided extensive updates on the Clinton email investigation, yet he refused to confirm that the FBI was investigating Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia during testimony before Congress in September. Furthermore, on Monday, CNBC reported that Comey was so sensitive about revealing information that could influence the election that he successfully argued against including the FBI in a statement that said the ‚ÄúU.S. intelligence community‚Äù was confident that Russia was behind the hacks of Democratic officials.Speaking of the hacks, the Times says that federal investigators now believe Russia‚Äôs goal was ‚Äúto disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine America‚Äôs standing in the world more broadly,‚Äù not to aid Trump‚Äôs campaign. That sparked disagreement over whether there‚Äôs any difference between the two goals.Others say there‚Äôs already ample reason to be concerned about Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia ‚Äî and it has nothing to do with claims made by shadowy intelligence sources. Vox‚Äôs Matt Yglesias said he‚Äôs more interested in Trump‚Äôs stated policies toward Russia than theories about what motivated them.Talking Points Memo‚Äôs Josh Marshall agreed, saying Trump‚Äôs relationship with Russia should be a huge issue for voters, even without Monday night‚Äôs barrage of allegations:‚Ä¶ if Russia has coopted or cultivated or compromised Trump that is a threat of the highest order. I can‚Äôt go on the word of an unnamed retired spy whose identity we don‚Äôt know, whose motives we can‚Äôt interrogate and whose evidence we can‚Äôt see. But I don‚Äôt think I need additional evidence. What‚Äôs been in plain sight for weeks, actually months, is more than enough to ring every alarm bell. And yet, with all the hints and arch remarks about Russia, the alarms have barely been rung.TRUMP IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN DECADES, THAT HAS NOT RELEASED HIS TAXES.  WHAT IS HE HIDING???#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumPutin#TrumpIsPutinsPuppet

Reportedly, a very good and anonymous source is saying that the email scandal, as bad as it is, is just a diversion from the Clinton Foundation whose tentacles reach far and wide in DC and across many waters....and especially with Trump in office, lots of heads are going to roll and political careers are going to be flushed and America is going to be really shocked at the dept and width of the corruption. The Clintons have almost single handedly soiled the perception of America around the world and weakened our national security and caused a Constitutional crisis all for the sake of more money and more power for them and their allies.

Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! What do you see? Before you deny its not true,...How did Saul Alinsky know the U.S. was heading toward a Social State 46+ years ago? It's a good question to think about!!!Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"! Wake up and Vote for Trump, he is our only hope to rid our country of the stinking rotten corruption!Help make our country great again,....‚Ä¢‚Ä¢CLICK ON MY PROFILE, to SHARE, if you care‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US.

She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleeding the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovreinity of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump.

What They Found Will RUIN HER LIFE Share on Facebook You‚Äôve probably heard by now that NYPD obtained Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin‚Äôs home devices as part of an investigation into Weiner‚Äôs alleged ‚Äúsexting‚Äù with underage girls‚Ä¶ But the cops didn‚Äôt stop with them!To their complete shock, the NYPD ended up finding and raiding HILLARY‚ÄôS property on those devices in the form of 650k emails connected to her personal email server‚Ä¶Now her private property is in the hands of the NYPD and FBI!An NYPD source just claimed that within the emails on that device, Hillary and Bill are directly implicated ins a MASSIVE child sex/trafficking ring along with their friend, and convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. (See Below)According to the source,‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs much more vile and serious than classified material on Weiner‚Äôs device. The emails DETAIL the trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary on their pedophile billionaire friend‚Äôs plane, the Lolita Express.‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking an international child enslavement and sex ring‚ÄúThese claims were backed up by other NYPD sources as well:Jeff Epstein is a level-3 registered sex offender and the media ignores the fact hat Bill Clinton flew 26 times on Epstein‚Äôs private Jet and allegedly visited Epstein‚Äôs sex slave island. Now that Hillary has also been directly implicated, the media cannot ignore this any longer! The NYPD source makes specific claims about her involvement. He says, ‚ÄúHillary has a well documented predilection for underage girls, and Mr. Weiner could not bear to see those details deleted.‚Äù This will end up being the biggest scandal uncovered in election history! THIS NYPD SOURCE IS CLAIMING HILLARY IS A PEDOPHILE!SHARE THIS on Facebook because the media refuses to cover it! From Anon News,Sex rings are popular in all governments, but pedophilia is primarily in British parliament & Saudi Arabia, and that‚Äôs why HRC and BC love foreign donors so much. They get paid in children as well as money. Dig deep and you can find it. It will sicken you.

He is not capable of honoring a contract because Trump doesn't pay his bills or the contractors who have worked on his construction projects and casinos. He hasn't paid federal taxes in over TWO decades and still doesn't pay like the rest of the hardworking Americans pay taxes. Trump, show us your tax returns!

She is not trusted by the majority of voters. But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US.

1 | Elizabeth L Jones | 22 | 10154786686014729_10154786733379729 | To be clear: there is no acceptable excuse for James Comey‚Äôs overt, intentional violation of The Hatch Act, which Congress passed to protect our republic from future excesses of, for instance, FBI Directors, using their sweeping powers to undermine our democratic processes and free elections. The only remedy The Hatch Act allows is the immediate removal of Director Comey from his position. NOW.
2 | Maureen Mc | 17 | 10154786686014729_10154786789034729 | The good people of Florida will cast the vote that serves their economic and social interests and those votes will be for Hillary Clinton. Many folks in Florida are from the NE and they know a con when they see one.
3 | Sharon Lietaert | 3 | 10154786686014729_10154786785689729 | A newly released email from WikiLeaks is just the latest evidence of the cozy relationship between the Clinton campaign and CNN.The February 2015 email entitled "Heads up - between us" shows that CNN sources leaked the results of polls to the Clinton campaign prior to publishing them. The results were leaked initially to Joel Benenson, a pollster and the Chief Strategist to Clinton campaign. They were then forwarded to chairman John Podesta, campaign manager Robby Mook, and Clinton aid Huma Abedin amongst others."I think you are going to enjoy a poll we have releasing tomorrow morning at 6:00 am ET that asks about 2016ers and whether they are perceived as candidates of the past or candidates of the future," the email from a "source" at CNN reads. "Some interesting findings..."This isn't the first time CNN's journalistic integrity has been called into question by a leaked email. Earlier this month it was revealed that interim chairperson of the DNC Donna Brazile had leaked a debate question to the Clinton campaign.
4 | Annabelle Collins | 6 | 10154786686014729_10154786936669729 | Republicans have been convinced since the 1990s that the Clintons are criminals. They have spent 25 years and millions of dollars from the public treasury investigating the couple. And they now point to the 25 years of investigation as evidence that the Clintons must be engaged in some sort of criminal activity. Perhaps they are, but the GOP hasn't had much luck uncovering it.

6 | Annabelle Collins | 1 | 10154786686014729_10154789457569729 | The word "explosive" has been rendered meaningless in this US presidential election ‚Äì so I'll just state this baldly. The FBI is investigating a deliberate, years-long Russian effort by which Moscow co-opted Donald Trump, and the Republican Party candidate had, until very recently, a super-secret internet server, which carried heavy, two-way traffic between his Manhattan tower and a Russian bank with close ties to the Kremlin.

My wife just got a letter from her health insurance company announcing that her rates were skyrocketing -- up more than 200% for next year. Most people would just clean their underwear and call their insurance company after the election. We called the next day and learned that the news wasn't nearly as bad. She could get slightly better coverage from her current company for just slightly more.Why would the insurance company send out the most dire letter possible unless they wanted to frighten people and maybe get them to vote against Hillary? (Not that she actually DESERVES anyone's vote, but I hate unfairness! Insurance companies HATE Obamacare and are probably mostly Republican.)

The memo, which has been provided to the FBI, claims Russian intelligence had ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù Mr Trump during his visits to Moscow and could ‚Äúblackmail him.‚ÄùThe former Western intelligence officer reportedly spent almost 20 years working on Russian intelligence matters and now works for a US firm gathering information on Russia for corporate clients.He was asked to research Mr Trump‚Äôs dealings in Russia in June.What he found was so serious he gave a copy of his report to the FBI without the permission of his employer.According to his sources, he said, ‚Äúthere was an established exchange of information between the Mr Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.‚ÄùMother Jones has reviewed the report and other memos the former spy wrote.The first memo, based on his conversations with Russian sources, noted, ‚ÄúRussian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.‚ÄùIt maintained that Mr Trump ‚Äúand his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.‚ÄùIt memo claimed Russian intelligence had ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù Mr Trump during his visits to Moscow and could ‚Äúblackmail him.‚ÄùIntelligence had also created a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on ‚Äúbugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.‚ÄùThe former spy said the response from the FBI was ‚Äúshock and horror.‚Äù
12 | Henrik Ahlm | 2 | 10154786686014729_10154786987789729 | Why vote Clinton and not Trump?It is one of the most simple questions to answer if you got a normal functioning brain.Like the editorial board of one of the world's most respected business newspapers said today:"Mrs Clinton carries enough baggage to fill a Boeing 747. She is not trusted by the majority of voters. But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US.

According to reports, at least 6 members of Congress and several leaders from federal agencies are implicated in the pedophile ring, which they say was run directly with the Clinton Foundation as a front. According to an NYPD source, emails found on Anthony Weiner‚Äôs laptop detail trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary Clinton on convicted pedophile pal billionaire Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs plane ‚ÄòLolitta express‚Äò to a place known as ‚ÄúSex Slave Island‚Äú.

Trump is for Law and Order and as he says Hillary should be in jail. Hillary is the one who "KNOWS" Putin, sold our uranium to Putin so Putin could in turn sell part to Iran, so they can make a bomb to kill us/our children/our grandchildren. Hillary received $125,000,000 from Middle-Eastern countries for this great selling off of America. I remember when Obama and Romney were debating about Iran and Obama said Iran cannot make a bomb because they do not have the uranium so Hillary and Obama fixed that, didn't they? And all the time Hillary is accepting this blood money she was claiming to be for women's rights, accepting the blood money from countries who abuse/kill/rape/beat/stone women when we all know Hillary has ruined more women's careers then Satan himself. Hillary threatened Bill women who he molested/raped/attempted to molest on National TV, sent private detectives to dig up dirt on them and had them ALL audited by the IRS. Hillary stands for open borders, for a One World Government but Trump stands for America and Americans.

This is their ‚ÄúForm 990‚Äù required by the IRS for all charities. In 2013 they had total revenue of $148,889,439 (Line 12). Their TOTAL Grants to Charity were $8,865,052 (Line 13). That is a measly 5.95%!!!!! Now, they are so efficient that it cost them a total of $84,684,494 in expenses (Line 18) to give away $8,865,052 to charity!!!!Including $29,914,108 in salaries (Line 15), $185,970 in fundraising fees (Line 16a, that‚Äôs actually legitimate), and a WHOPPING $45,719,364 (Line 17) in ‚Äúother expenses‚Äù!!!!!So AFTER all that hard charitable work they end the year with $247,299,458 (Line 22), a cool $100,000,000 more than was contributed for The year!!! Folks, no matter how you slice and dice it, this is simply a blatant money laundering program. They don‚Äôt even try to hide it!!!

But, his appeal is not really about him. It‚Äôs about racism, sexism, anti-semitism, and every intolerant ‚Äúism‚Äù you can imagine. The people who live to hate would support any candidate or any party that promotes division and hatred. These are the same people who waged a war against the nation‚Äôs first African American president, Barack Obama. They are now ready to block the first female president.The divisions Trump‚Äôs supporters foolishly seek would weaken this country from within and could only benefit the likes of a Putin, Iran or ISIS. But bigotry and common sense often cancel each other out.Indeed, Trump‚Äôs appeal isn‚Äôt about his qualifications, his shady deals, his tax dodging, his insulting veterans, his treatment of women and people of color. His supporters couldn‚Äôt care less about those issues. They care about their hate, and Trump is popular with them because he has become the flagbearer of hatred in this country. Fortunately, this country has far more good people than bad.All decent Americans should get out and vote, not just against Trump, but against all the Republican senators and representatives who endorsed him.Lyrics from the movie South Pacific about hate.written by Rodgers and Hammerstein.‚ÄúYou've got to be taughtTo hate and fear,You've got to be taughtFrom year to year,It's got to be drummedIn your dear little earYou've got to be carefully taught.You've got to be taught to be afraidOf people whose eyes are oddly made,And people whose skin is a diff'rent shade,You've got to be carefully taught.You've got to be taught before it's too late,Before you are six or seven or eight,To hate all the people your relatives hate,You've got to be carefully taught!‚Äù

A vote for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka and the Green Party is a vote for a viable multi-party democracy going forward."Just 5 percent of the national vote for the Green Party Stein/Baraka ticket can be a true game-changer for American politics. It will qualify the Green Party for recognition as an official national party, and for federal funding in the 2020 presidential race proportional to the amount of votes received ‚Äî at least $8 million to $10 million. It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state). It means the party can leap over the undemocratic barriers to ballot access for independent parties in many states, and help us lay the groundwork for a truly competitive challenge to the two-party system and the corporate rule it perpetuates."Third Party Presidential Forum:One week before what‚Äôs shaping up to be an historic presidential election, Tavis Smiley on PBS will host a presidential forum featuring the third party candidates, Jill Stein of the Green Party and Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party.This forum will be taped live Monday, October 31, 2016, in the show‚Äôs Los Angeles studio and air on Tavis Smiley over two nights next week on Mondayevening and Tuesday, November 1 on PBS.

17 | John Davidson | 29 | 10154786389619729_10154786628544729 | Why is Hillary being held to standards above those which previously held the same position? Why isn't there a desire to solve and protect the next heads of state from these types of scandals?

Although October ‚Äî and its surprises ‚Äî have become cliche in politics at this point, it‚Äôs hard to remember a final month of a presidential campaign that has contained so many twists and turns.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kourosh The Researcher | 13 | 10154784402249729_10154784433359729 | Trump has 4 Federal investigations 1) Alleged rape of 13 year old girl. 2) Tax investigation. And refusal to release tax records even though pissed and moan for Romney to release his  3) Operating a Fake university  4) Fake Foundation
2 | Joe King | 0 | 10154784402249729_10154789041929729 | The cliche is WP is a presstitutes for Democratic Party DNC and HJC. Are you Pay to play with the CLINTON Foundation? Or are you follower it had to tell if only 6 % of people believe media that is worse than when Nancy Pelosi was majority leader of house. JMO
3 | Daniel Mochrie | 3 | 10154784402249729_10154785029664729 | Every Dog has it day. Soon it will be Hillary Clinton's day in Federal Court. The thing I love about this the most is that there is nothing you or the lying Media can lie about, or blame Trump for on this matter. This is all Hillary's mess and she only will have to answer for her corrupt ways.The good news is that Bill Clinton is very happy it wasn't his Weiner that got Hillary in trouble this time.
4 | Nicolle Martin | 0 | 10154784402249729_10154786293194729 | Hillary did this to herself....don't blame Comey....her lies and corruption caught up to her....it is almost funny that a pervert Weiner brought her down.....but our country safety is at stake....did Weiner send these emails to Russia????
5 | Alex Alvarado | 4 | 10154784402249729_10154785024144729 | Copy from Facebook page of Kevin M Carney(opposing Views.) A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!

Do you know the Government handouts that Trump has so far collected from GOVERNMENT, all by himself, by his own admission, is so much bigger than the handouts that millions of supposed single moms of America has collected as ‚ÄúGov. Handouts‚Äù? No wonder, they call you ‚ÄúRednecks‚Äù & ‚Äúdeplorables‚Äù.Corporate America is collecting more Government Handouts than all people on welfare list (X 10).

8 | David Goldfarb | 0 | 10154784402249729_10154785537794729 | HIllary is a career felon who belongs in prison. She set up the email server to hid he real crimes of the phony Clinton Foundation which has made her hundreds of millions in illegal donations from the worlds most crooked businessmen and world dictators.
9 | Marcia Tanabe | 1 | 10154784402249729_10154784454624729 | Had enough of scandals?  A vote for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka and the Green Party is a vote for a viable multi-party democracy going forward."Just 5 percent of the national vote for the Green Party Stein/Baraka ticket can be a true game-changer for American politics. It will qualify the Green Party for recognition as an official national party, and for federal funding in the 2020 presidential race proportional to the amount of votes received ‚Äî at least $8 million to $10 million. It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state). It means the party can leap over the undemocratic barriers to ballot access for independent parties in many states, and help us lay the groundwork for a truly competitive challenge to the two-party system and the corporate rule it perpetuates."Third Party Presidential Forum:One week before what‚Äôs shaping up to be an historic presidential election, Tavis Smiley on PBS will host a presidential forum featuring the third party candidates, Jill Stein of the Green Party and Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party.This forum will be taped live Monday, October 31, 2016, in the show‚Äôs Los Angeles studio and air on Tavis Smiley over two nights next week on Mondayevening and Tuesday, November 1 on PBS. An additional thirty (30) minute conversation, with questions selected entirely from social media will be available exclusively online at the Tavis Smiley PBS website.Viewers may submit questions to the candidates via Twitter, Instagram and Facebook using the hashtags: #TavisSmileyForum, #AskJill or #AskGary.
