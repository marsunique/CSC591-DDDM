If elected president, Donald J. Trump said he will suspend the Syrian refugee program and "keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of your community."

Let the USA board Trump train to move forward
2 | Ludmilla Juliana | 193 | 10154756355956336_10154756368981336 | Who are all this celebrities who never created any jobs or contributed to society judge Trump!? They are all a basket of hypocrites who only care about money and getting more and more rich. We, the people with normal lives and normal jobs should decide what is best for OUR future. All of those celebrities endorsing Killary are getting paid to do so. They don't care about the majority Americans as long as they have their millions in their bank account( just like corrupt crooked Killary). Corruption is heavy in this country, and Killary's days of corruption and lies are numbered! #Trump2016, all the way!!!!!
3 | Tammy Morrison Edwards | 45 | 10154756355956336_10154756373396336 | Well PRAISE GOD!! That needs to be done! Good grief, that loon of a woman running wants to open every border across the nations and just let people come and go as they please...can we say idiot...
4 | Wayne R Johnson | 47 | 10154756355956336_10154756369716336 | If it were not for the existence of FOXNews 90% of America would believe Hillary Clinton an angel and Donald Trump was Satan. Only Fox has attempted to expose the truth of both candidates. They may not always be fair and balanced but, they are a lot closer than any other network to giving us the truth.
5 | Mary L. Dunphy | 16 | 10154756355956336_10154756385886336 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered her powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

6 | Chris Devaney | 20 | 10154756355956336_10154756369601336 | It is time for All Americans to Coalesce around Donald J. Trump  and Governor Mike Pence, Hillary Clinton poll numbers are dropping by the hour, just now Donald J. Trump is Up in North Carolina too and most polls are going up by the hour. Hillary Clinton can barely get a couple of thousand people to come to her rally's. Donald J. Trump will have much work to do starting day 1, and he will do it for All of Americans.
7 | Michael Plante | 12 | 10154756355956336_10154756378301336 | Hillary is responsible for all of the negative responses, why did she knowingly accept the debate questions from brasile, is that presidential?.... Or cheating and corrupt. Hillary has lost all integrity and trust. She must be disqualified.
8 | Todd Jones | 5 | 10154756355956336_10154756373726336 | Trump said it: I love uneducated voters, and they love me.Trumps base: uneducated, uniformed, gun nuts, prone to violent behavior, ignorant, arrogant, and racist. Oh, and they can't write a coherent sentence, way too many basic grammar and spelling errors.
9 | Xavier Keough | 17 | 10154756355956336_10154756367416336 | Solving Immigration in 60 secondsFor decades politicians have muddled a simple issue of national security with endless victimization banter solely to achieve their goal of forever tipping America’s electoral balance. California is case-in-point - a once red state turned dark blue via orchestrated illegal immigration, rampant anti-Americanism and blanket Amnesty. Unfortunately, considering an estimated 15-20 million illegal immigrants currently reside in America, locating and deporting those individuals would be an arduous task if not an extremely costly one. Not only could such an endeavor result in mass chaos in the streets, a public relations nightmare would ensue if these actions resulted in loss of life among immigration officials or the countless subjects they pursued. Although America is fully justified in deporting or arresting all of these individuals and their families, I believe these critical concerns can be diligently and equitably addressed in 5 simple steps, or more succinctly, one Constitutional Amendment.1) Any illegal immigrant wishing to remain in America must come forward to be fully vetted, medically and criminally. Those who successfully pass will be approved for a conditional guest/work visa and required to pay taxes; which will include a national duty imposed on all foreign guest workers to pay for their screening and monitoring. However, because these individuals knowingly broke our immigration laws, they will NOT be eligible for citizenship, public assistance or granted the right to vote. Any guest worker/resident who commits future egregious or felonious acts – i.e., murder, rape, acts of terrorism, vote fraud, harboring other illegals – will be imprisoned, deported, and permanently barred from re-entering the country. Their immediate family will also be subject to the same penalties. All children or “anchor babies” born to guest residents will not receive citizenship or the privileges prescribed within.2) Those immigrants wishing to become actual American citizens must physically leave the country, file for citizenship and complete the process afforded by law before returning to America; those prudent actions they should have taken before illegally crossing our border. 3) Eliminate all Sanctuary Cities. American citizens are not given refugee from breaking the law so why would a foreign trespasser? Those illegals who do not subject themselves to a background check for a guest visa, or willingly vacate the country to apply for citizenship, will be tracked/arrested and banned from returning to America or ever applying for citizenship.4) Build a Wall. Once completed, anyone who illegally enters America will serve a mandatory prison term, be deported, and banned from returning or ever becoming a U.S. citizen. 5) All immigration from Islamic countries must cease for the foreseeable future; at least until a credible method is found to properly identify Muslims and thoroughly investigate their backgrounds for possible radical ties. All Islamic nationals currently residing in America on guest or student visas must be identified and re-screened. If insufficient information exists on any given subject, they will be immediately returned to their native country. With a 500% increase in the prevalence of global terrorist attacks since 2008, consider these precautions justified and long overdue. Self-preservation needs to justification.Every civilized nation recognizes the absolute necessity of protecting their borders and maintaining an orderly immigration program. With due diligence, not subversive political subterfuge, we can honor the promise of America - a beacon of hope and opportunity for all mankind - without sacrificing our national sovereignty or the safety of the American people; that indelible duty our elected government swore to fulfill.
10 | David Saka | 32 | 10154756355956336_10154756366796336 | send Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Huma Abedin to federal prison where they belong with Anthony Weiner!!!!
11 | Arlene Rodriguez | 2 | 10154756355956336_10154756389826336 | I think if your gonna get rid of terrorists... it should be across the board.... last I checked columbine, sandy hook, the Colorado theatre and Virginia tech were not done by Muslims.... just saying terrorists come from all backgrounds

14 | Joseph Tierney | 0 | 10154756355956336_10154756391286336 | Yes. No need for political spin, he says what he means and means what he says and that's why he's going to be the next president of United States of America. This is why the people will elect him, this is what the vast majority of the people want. And that is democracy,  the will of the people the majority of the people must be the law of the land. If you don't like it and you are in the minority, remember that in a democracy it is the majority of the will of the people. The minority has had eight years to rule and has done a deplorable job tearing down this nation and the majority will take it back and rebuild it. Accept  this, minority or risk more fascism. We live in a democratic republic, a nation ruled by law. That is America.
15 | Alec Gormley | 0 | 10154756355956336_10154756400356336 | Donald's problem is that he is too strong he needs to tone it down he does not need to prove Hillary is corrupt we already know it. What he needs to do now is hang on to her skirt like Bill and Weiner did going along for the ride commenting on what she says with a little clarity.
16 | Rick Holmes | 0 | 10154756355956336_10154756392186336 | Thank you, that will make me feel a lot safer with you in the White House working for America. hil will be to busy getting even and fighting her legal battles to govern. Pathetic Dem , But what other choice did they have...
17 | Patrick Kazmierczak | 7 | 10154756355956336_10154756370796336 | If the goal is to eventually return them to Syria then we can do more good for more people housing them in other countries in the region. There is no reason to bring them here.
18 | Harry Scott | 0 | 10154756355956336_10154756392561336 | I 'm for the safety of the Syrian refugees but that can be accomplished without dislodging them from their part of the world.If Obama had half a brain and a pair, this situation would never happened!

20 | Syed Bilal | 1 | 10154756355956336_10154756395551336 | Shame on you Mr Trump! Syrians aren't refugee by choice but through opression mainly due to proxy fight among World Powers. To remind you here that your country is part of that fight. When an infant is killed in bombardment, it's not his fault but fault of either of your allies or due to your favourite Putin or through terrorist ISIS. Deport illegal immigrants but going as low as to opress the already opressed is for what God will never forget you. You will see God's reply in 8Nov results. #NeverDRUMP
21 | I Want Less Government And For The Congress To Stop Wasting Our Tax Dollars | 0 | 10154756355956336_10154756394826336 | Polling shows Clinton to be perceived as having a better temperament than Trump but Trump is perceived as being much more honest and trustworthy. So the choice is a calm liar or an exuberant straight shooter.
22 | Carl Lafong | 0 | 10154756355956336_10154756391161336 | The term radical needs to be changed to "fundamental Islamic terrorists". It not " radicals" who are doing all the terror, it's the ones who are only doing exactly what the Quran stats. 2:216,5:33,and 8:12 for a few examples.

1 | Chris Devaney | 976 | 10154755969076336_10154756088811336 | Working hard for your vote, Donald J. Trump has not taken more then one day off now and then for 18 months, no vacations, no long weekends, no naps, no nights off like Hillary Clinton to sneak behind closed doors to shake down Wall Street/Hollywood types for $30,000 a plate and up dinners behind gated walled residences. He has always been a worker. And he will work non-stop for All Americans.
2 | Robert Perri | 710 | 10154755969076336_10154756089811336 | Now that's how a Presidential/President should sound.  Not like  President Obama and Hillary who would rather trash the cops, and feel sorry for the criminals/murders.
3 | Ann Ylrebmik | 122 | 10154755969076336_10154756090526336 | Someone called it right...they said there would be a police shooting or something to get the focus off of Hillary being investigated again....sad and pathetic how we can call the shots bout what will go down before it happens with this poor excuse for what you call a woman!!
4 | Bill Right | 97 | 10154755969076336_10154756090541336 | I would trust PeeWee Herman sitting behind me in a movie theater while out on a date with O J Simpson, drinking at Bill Cosby's bar with Flint Michigan ice cubes, all while Casey Anthony babysits for me before I would trust HER to walk my dog!!!
5 | Heather Malek Rice | 89 | 10154755969076336_10154756090801336 | Thank you Mr Trump for acknowledging current events. If you go to Killarys page, it's all about her campaign and asking for more money. And she NEVER talks to the American people.
6 | Debby Havard Slater | 45 | 10154755969076336_10154756110936336 | God bless you, Donald Trump. I am praying our Father is with you, but more importantly, that He is in your heart and that HE will remain there as you take the highest office in our land. Many prayers for these families who have lost loved ones just because they are trying to protect our lives. I am praying this Trump presidency will restore patriotism and respect for our military and police officers and self-respect and independence to United States citizens.
7 | Susan Turner Petersen | 46 | 10154755969076336_10154756091056336 | RIP officers Trump has to win this election. I am from a family of LEO.'s. sorry to politicize this tragedy but I want our LEO's to work and live in a better place than they are now..

9 | Elaine Bollinger-Rife | 15 | 10154755969076336_10154756112966336 | Yes Trump actually prays! And at his Conventions they open with a prayer! So, why do people want a Woman who thinks she is a God and can get away with crimes? She never has prayer at her Conventions! She is to arrogant! And, she does not support our Country! She never has flags or flag pins, only Hillary pins and her communist outfits!
10 | Julie Bir | 17 | 10154755969076336_10154756111861336 | Donald Trump is absolutely right. People who cannot respect their police force, their protectors must be deported or put behind bars. It's a shame on those Americans. Big shame. Trump for president on this!
11 | Mike Hatch | 18 | 10154755969076336_10154756108366336 | instead of puking out talking points, why not report what you see in your town - here in panhandle of Florida its all solid red and the enthusiasm is incredible - no HRC signs here!!!!
12 | Ted Bennett | 14 | 10154755969076336_10154756099301336 | SO why was the original reaction "Thanks BLM!" or "we know it was a Muslim" but now that it's a deranged white man who is likely a right-wing Christian and is a Trump supporter, all you hear is *crickets*this is what you need to fear, right here America. People like this lunatic.
13 | Alec Gormley | 9 | 10154755969076336_10154756097836336 | It is an attack on us all just like what we are going through with ISIS and Obama releases them from Gitmo OMG and you can't see a problem with that, what is he saying by releasing terrorists, they are now fighting again sooo?
14 | Dan Jestic | 8 | 10154755969076336_10154756111461336 | Can't wrap my head around the disconnect: mindless Liberals continuing to talk about the need for "community policing"to nurture trust and respect while cops get  picked off one by one. Thanks, Mr. President, for championing respect for law and order [eye roll].
15 | Adam Storick | 4 | 10154755969076336_10154756149111336 | Q:Why do all his videos have smiley faces and she has angry ones? How is she winning?A: Surprising at may be to you, this is Fox News' website. The majority of people in this site are Pro Trump. It's like asking why does a video of Hitler's speech circa 1939 get a ton of likes on Stormfront's website. Rest assured. Also, voters on the left are more educated (in most part) than those on the right. This allows us to actually verbalize our opinions, rather than having to settle for CAPITALIZING words for no reason and including a s--t tone of US flags and turd emojis to get our points across.Q: Why do his rallies have 25K people and Hillary can't fill a Gym.A: While it makes for a good story, in reality it's not the case. Trump is in his element however when he does all the talking and doesn't have to answer any questions (see debates 1-3). There were 120,000,000+ votes cast in the 2012 election, not thousands. In any case, this is not an indicator for who will win the election. As Seth Meyers said on his show recently, "If getting the most people in one place is the deciding factor in the election, our next President would be IKEA on a Saturday."Q: Why doesn't Hillary ever wear a US Flag Pin?A: The election is not an Olympic event. The right is often caught up on "symbols" measuring how much someone is Patriotic or not. In reality, wearing a flag pin on your lapel does not measure one's Patriotism, it's simply a prop. Prior to the election, did you see Trump wearing a flag pin on his lapel? Of course not. He only has started to do so now, because he knows a large number of his base fall for it.
16 | Ayden N EliSanchez | 9 | 10154755969076336_10154756128371336 | You will never catch Hillary praying, shes going to take away our religous freedom. Christians need to get out and vote, be bold church now is not the time to sitback. We WILL have our country and freedoms taken. Neither trump or Hillary are great, but pay attention to who will be working and helping making key decisions. Who will be in their ear influencing their decisions, are they good people, do they stand for what is right and what is Just?
17 | Jim Denney | 5 | 10154755969076336_10154756097791336 | Could a Political Promise like this get someone elected President? Couldn't hurt any, right? Attention: Here's what I need to hear from the Presidential Candidates, "any Law that has been passed, or will be passed in the future or any Executive Order that has already been signed, or any Executive Order that will be signed in the future, will apply equally to everyone from the President on down to everyone in these United States of America, no exceptions." If you think like I do, please "like" & "share". Think about this, we may never get a chance like this again. Think about Congress and other people in DC and the "WALK-AROUND" Clause in Obamacare!!
18 | Deborah Ahrns | 5 | 10154755969076336_10154756126111336 | Amen we need a fund raiser to help the families of ALL of the fallen officers this year!  Also NC is still recovering from the hurricane it would be very important to raise this awareness and visit this area with relief food water and mobile homes while they are rebuilding.

23 | Brenen Oakley Dukeman | 2 | 10154755969076336_10154756203921336 | I post this for the folks that are still trying to gather the facts. These were taken from random articles found online. Like I always say... don't take mine or anyone's word. Do the research yourself and form your own opinion.1. Hillary Clinton is a liar. I don’t mean this as political conjecture, but a proven, verifiable liar. She lied about the Irish peace process, her vote in favor of the Iraq war, her reason for illegally using a personal email server, that her family was dead broke when they left the White House, about landing under sniper fire in Bosnia, where Chelsea was on 9/11, who she was named after, Benghazi… and the list goes on. We don’t need a liar-in-chief. We tried that already. It didn’t work.2. Hillary Clinton was MIA when the 3am phone call came from Benghazi. What difference does it make? The life of four Americans – a huge difference. The Russian Reset? Russia invaded Ukraine on her watch. Again. And again. And again. Boko Haram? Hillary Clinton’s State Department refused to call it a terrorist organization.3. Hillary Clinton accepted millions of Dollars from foreign governments.While serving as Secretary of State, The Clinton Foundation (illegally) accepted boatloads of cash from countries that fund Hamas, harbor terrorists, suppress women, and regularly execute gays and lesbians.4. Hillary Clinton wants women to shut up. At least all of the women who tried to come forward regarding her hubby’s sexual harassment, misogyny and overall perpetuation of “rape culture“. She referred to these victims as “trailer trash” and even went so far as to threaten one of the victims in person.5. Hillary Clinton Was the Only First Lady to Ever be SubpoenaedDuring the first few years Hillary was the First Lady, the Clinton’s were engulfed in the Whitewater controversy. The trouble started back in 1992 when the New York Times released an article alleging both Bill and Hillary Clinton invested and lost money with the Whitewater Development Corporation. The article prompted a full-scale investigation into the actions of the Clinton’s, where every real estate investment they were involved with was now cast under a giant spotlight.These investments dated back throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and finally counsel Robert Fiske issued a grand-jury subpoena to Bill and Hillary Clinton to turn over all documents that pertained to this matter. To this date, this marks the only time in United States history that a First Lady has ever been subpoenaed.6. Hillary Clinton’s Horrible Foreign Policies RecordDuring Hillary Clinton’s time as Secretary of State, her stance on foreign policies can be called nothing short of deplorable. She aggressively pushed for the 2009 troops surge in Afghanistan. Hillary has been a huge proponent of the same drone war that to date has resulted in the deaths of over 2,400 civilians. Hillary bragged on record about her crippling sanctions imposed on the Iranian culture, yet those sanctions have been discovered to have only benefited the wealthy. Her views on Iranian nuclear enrichment went on to open the doors to a full military intervention. She was in favor of the United States getting involved in the Iraq War, backtracking ten years later to finally admit she regretted that decision after all.7. Hillary Clinton Ran the State Department Into the GroundListen closely to Hillary on the campaign trail as she touts her time running the state department as an accomplishment to hang her hat on. She is quick to talk about the thousands of miles she racked up traveling to numerous countries. One thing you will never hear Hillary Clinton discuss, a single accomplish that she made during her time there. Pay close attention to the Inspector Generals reports that blast her mismanagement of money, claiming she irresponsibly blew through over $6 billion dollars of taxpayer money due to her lack of control at that department.Compound that with how she claims to be the mother of Obamacare, saying she in fact pushed for that exact idea over twenty years earlier. Clinton has nothing new to offer the country, in fact the only policies that she readily talks about are exact extensions of ones President Obama already has in place. Hillary wants China to buy United States debt to fund the stimulus, believes in cap-and-trade, and wants a tax increases on businesses. Nothing new here!8. Hillary Clinton Referred to Her Husband’s Affair as a Right-Wing ConspiracyAfter the reports went public about the affair between then President Bill Clinton and White House intern Monica Lewinsky, Hillary Clinton took to the airwaves to quickly dispel the affair. During an interview in 1998 on NBC’s The Today Show, Hillary defended her husband by stating the incident was nothing more than a right-wing conspiracy that has been brewing ever since Bill Clinton was announced President of the United States.She rambled on about how the right would do just about anything to smear the reputation of her and her husband, and repeated that her husband was in fact innocent. As horrible as her denying the allegations, it looked even worse when Bill Clinton finally admitted he did have the affair with the young intern after Lewinsky produced physical evidence. The conversation about the right-wing conspiracy was never mentioned again by Hillary.9. Hillary Clinton is Only First Lady to Ever be Fingerprinted by the FBIDuring the Clinton presidency, yet another infamous incident called “Filegate” reared it’s ugly head. In June of 1996, allegations arose claiming both Bill and Hillary Clinton had improper access in 1993-1994 to confidential FBI documents. The allegations revealed that the Director of White House personnel security, Craig Livingstone, was improperly requesting background reports from the Federal Bureau of Investigations of people who served under Republican administrations. Concerned that the Clinton’s might be playing dirty like the Nixon’s administration had done decades earlier, the Senate Judiciary Committee took action. Orrin Hatch, then Republican committee chair, requested the FBI do fingerprint analysis of both Bill and Hillary Clinton.
24 | Dewey Dewman Rankin | 3 | 10154755969076336_10154756115846336 | Pay attention to how the game is being played. Yesterday Paul Ryan stated that he has a replacement for Obamacare ready to go. Trump is going to call a special session to allow it to be brought to the floor. Maybe they have been home...
25 | Alec Gormley | 2 | 10154755969076336_10154756139081336 | The rapist election, Hillary and her rapist or Donald the presumed rapist hmmm a known rapist pointing the finger at another suspected rapist, good move. Hillary will enable her rapists like she did WEINER to screw us all with. IRONY!

6 | Mary Hopkins | 48 | 10154755926446336_10154755946636336 | I was so heartbroken this morning when I heard about the ambush....I am glad this man is caught so he can be brought to justice, although this will not replace the officers that were killed, at least he will have to face his punishment!
7 | Shirley Vercelli | 74 | 10154755926446336_10154755953576336 | I'm just sick about this horrible murder of two officers! I can't wait til Nov.8th for the change to start and police are respected again!!

9 | Scott Mattern | 44 | 10154755926446336_10154755951566336 | Too bad he didn't point a gun at them. So they could do the us tax payers a favor. Prayers for the families of these brave officers that sacrificed their lives to serve and protect us.
10 | Bj Taylor | 27 | 10154755926446336_10154755972431336 | liberals' America.  We older Americans have managed to fail to teach the younger generation, the value of ethics, morals, and that there really is a right and wrong.  We have enabled them to conclude that God is a waste of time and they can successfully direct the future of America without Him.
11 | Vicki Hammons Woodlee | 19 | 10154755926446336_690126247820685 | As the mother of two police officers, I am sorry and sad when any police life is taken. The officers were sitting in their squad cars. Probably waiting for the shift to end. Maybe doing a report from a previous call. Maybe thinking about getting home and seeing their son/daughter before the child heads off to school. The officers weren't in a confrontation. They weren't on a dangerous call. They were simply being a human being. In a car. With a badge and uniform. And they were killed for that. Please America.Stop.
12 | Sparky Beason | 10 | 10154755926446336_690122867821023 | This is so very disturbing. One of the shootings happened just blocks from my home. I never expected anything like this to happen in our small peaceful community. God bless these officers and pray for the families of the fallen. I also pray that Donald Trump will be elected on Tuesday with the hope of law and order restored in our broken nation.
13 | David Kieffer | 31 | 10154755926446336_10154755967601336 | Why didn't they kill him? If he were black they probably would have. Just sayin......by the way before anybody says anything , I'm white. My condolences and prayers go out the families and friends of the officers this monster took from us.
14 | Linda Davis | 21 | 10154755926446336_10154755945196336 | Just watched the Gov of Colorado and want to tell him that everyone of my friends that live in that state said they are voting for Trump.  I wouldn't write him off yet and say he only has the people that show up at his rallies.  Good try
15 | David Lester | 12 | 10154755926446336_10154755948631336 | So Hillary is really upset that the FBI Director James Comey is "dumping" on her right before the election.... So everyone wants to know Hillary, how does it feel to be aborted just 11 days before delivery?

19 | Margaret J. Barron | 11 | 10154755926446336_10154755963736336 | My question is how was he able to walk up to them..if he was black he would have been presumed dangerous..If he was black man I believe he'd be a dead black man..Now there is a white man awaiting his justice..If he was black man please tell me differently
20 | Alec Gormley | 7 | 10154755926446336_10154755955756336 | Systemic failure of this magnitude is scary, wait till rioters start shooting back armed and ready to do battle against the Hillary mafia ruining our country.

Spread the News: Police are asking parents to "please check and double check your children's candy."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Allen Stafford | 686 | 10154755913156336_10154755918656336 | I've been checking in son's candy for days..... I still haven't swallowed a nail.
2 | Jd Bales | 322 | 10154755913156336_10154755929626336 | Historically it's the kids parents looking for money or fame... no kid has ever died from Halloween candy. Stop spreading fear.
3 | Dottie Ann | 148 | 10154755913156336_10154755928121336 | A GOOD IDEA FOR PARENTS: Take your children Trick or Treating for the experience but then dispose of all the candy when you get home. Instead, YOU give them a big bag filled with an assortment of all their favorites! Worth it to keep your children safe! (Just my thoughts as a Critical Care RN.)
4 | Gene Cole | 98 | 10154755913156336_10154755942631336 | Every year it's the same thing. Scary unsubstantiated urban folklore. Next year I'm going to spread the rumor that my daughter came home with a puppy in her candy bucket !!!
5 | Jessica R Ferris | 71 | 10154755913156336_10154755938441336 | I'm a big skeptic of these reports. Not to say you shouldn't check and throw away candy with compromised wrapping or just looks suspicious. But most of the time these are staged.
6 | Michelle Craddock | 79 | 10154755913156336_10154755928811336 | I think going door-to-door on halloweens time has come and gone.  Parents should have block parties for their kids instead.  I think it would be safer.  There are too many nut jobs in the world who want to harm children.
7 | Brian Carter | 33 | 10154755913156336_10154755942371336 | This is why soccer mom's invented Trunk or Treat. Stop spreading fear and BS. You are also the reason for people putting up Christmas decorations before Halloween.  #stopprematuredecorations
8 | Joshua Clark | 15 | 10154755913156336_10154755941856336 | IF this is real...and I say that because there have been so many hoax stories over the years...it means that someone is committing this violent and malicious act from their own home, in person. Seems that your kids didnt go to THAT many houses where you couldn't figure out where these came from. Some kids (most) eat a bit of candy while walking house to house. I cant believe nobody figured this out and got the person arrested.  That being said, I didnt read the article....this is the first thing in my news feed and I've had too much coffee.
9 | Mickey Burrøw | 13 | 10154755913156336_10154755961406336 | Back in the 70s and 80s the big scare was razors in apples. I guess it would be hard to shove a Gillette Mach 3 disposable into a fun size.
10 | Johnathan Mahoney | 7 | 10154755913156336_10154755986836336 | Why are these parents not taking their child's over-the-counter medicines to a local chemist to verify poisions haven't been added, does nobody remember the worker tampering with Tylenol in the early 80s? That KILLED people, I don't recall these 'check your candy' stories reporting injuries in the past years... yet parents will flip out and have this stuff xrayed, and dissected; but none of you 'catious' parents think about testing ANYTHING else, at least nothing else but Halloween candy. I bet you don't do it for Christmas candy or easter candy or birthday pinata candy do you??I'm just sick of these stupid seasonal paranoia 'Your kids are at risk' kind of stories.
11 | Roxanne Carrell Hall | 6 | 10154755913156336_10154755990881336 | I think the days of knocking on a stranger's door and getting candy are quickly coming to an end. There are too many other halloween events for kids to participate in ... schools, churches, local trunk and treats and tons of other places.
12 | Frank Sullivan | 6 | 10154755913156336_10154755994246336 | Listen folks, I understand the fears, wanting safety for your children is paramount! Next Halloween, take a magnet with you. Strong 💪 enough to detect metal objects in a thick candy 🍭 bar. After each visit, switch it around in the bag 💼. If there is metal detected at this house 🏡 and not the prior house 🏡, bingo!Now, don't be a hero and confront the giver, contact the police 🚨, let THEM do it. Enjoy 😊 Halloween 👻 WITH your kids, keep them safe. I grew up in Edwardsburg, Michigan, from east to west, lower Michigan is a farming belt. Good 😊 folks, but, DON'T let a few sick 😷 individuals ruin what can be a fun evening for kids.
13 | Robin Hensley Smoot | 5 | 10154755913156336_10154755969996336 | Oh for crying out loud! I have been hearing of this since I was a kid back in the 70s, and every year parents "find" needles, nails razor blades etc in their kids candy, if this were actually true then aren't parents playing a form of Russian Roulette by taking them Trick or Treating?!  Might be some parents are looking for attention, ever thought about that?
14 | Joyce Menzel | 2 | 10154755913156336_10154755981496336 | What is going on with our country?  How can anyone try and hurt our children?  They are kids. They are innocent and don't deserve that. Our country has turned so evil because God has been taken out of everything. We better fall on our knees and pray that God hasn't forsaken us.
15 | Leslie Howard Lubke | 6 | 10154755913156336_10154755939841336 | still doing this after all these years, my parents started check for needles and such in the 1960's. I checked my son's in the 1980's. Keep checking, we have too to keep us safe from the crazies.
16 | Linda Frazier | 0 | 10154755913156336_1212295925517853 | They use to be able to get candy x-rays  for fee years ago. Are we as parents going to go after that route again. Although now I don't think they'll even let anybody extra candy because the health care prices have risen so high because of Obamacare
17 | Robert Hill | 4 | 10154755913156336_10154755947016336 | Metal detecting is a great hobby and a good way to check for nails, needles, bottle caps and pull tabs. I find them all the time ... in the dirt.
18 | Stephanie Ann Fischer | 0 | 10154755913156336_1212295418851237 | I remember the ER opening up the X-ray department in the 80's for our parents on Halloween night. We'd go get our bag X-rayed before going home. Free of charge. Unfortunate this isn't a new thing.
19 | Donald Brockhaus | 0 | 10154755913156336_10154756022801336 | I didn't know you could even still buy Mars Bars.  I used to love them but haven't seen them in years.  But anyone who would do this to hurt kids is one sick puppy.
20 | Cheryl Moore | 0 | 10154755913156336_10154756050161336 | For the parents who are really concerned about this issue and are so sure that it's real, there's place here (Velocity care) that will x-ray your child's candy, they'll even let the kids have the x-ray of thier candy, all for free! Now with that said, they did stop doing it last night it was just through Nov. 1st, but they advertised it a few days up to Halloween. So there are places that do things if you want to be safe about it. But that just means next year they'll be saying heroine was injected into a tootsie roll for a creamy center. The rumors spread so easily, don't let false accusations kill the one time a year the kids get to go have a good time....that will just make Halloween an adult's only holiday for us to have drinks while the kids go to bed bored.
21 | Danielle Warren Smith | 0 | 10154755913156336_10154756110551336 | Jd Bales ...these stories are most likely true...when I was little someone put a sewing needle in my pumpkin shaped candy corn...check your kids candy people...I grew up in a small town
22 | Zoey Clare | 0 | 10154755913156336_10154756153246336 | Not saying this didn't really happen, however.... there always seems to be 1 or 2 parents who find "things" in their kids' candy yet nobody else who collected candy from the same area had any candy tampered with. There definitely are crazy people out there but one would think they would tamper with more than one piece of candy. I think I'd be checking the parents tool shed. Everyone is looking for their 15 min these days.
23 | Melissa Bosso | 0 | 10154755913156336_10154755962256336 | It's sad to think parents have to worry about this...but it's been going on for so long, it's hard to believe some parents STILL need reminding to protect their kids from the evil that is sometimes perpetrated on Halloween. 99% of the time it's probably fine. It's the 1%.

Start making examples out of bad behavior. i don`t care about their socioeconomic background or any other excuses. they are only sorry if they get caught.
25 | Ashley Allgood | 0 | 10154755913156336_10154756058401336 | I watched a show on legends about Halloween. What started this fear was actually a man who killed his son on Halloween and blamed it on tainted candy. If I am remembering it right he also poisoned a few of his sons friends just to make it look real. I'll see if I can the actual story.Thankfully Snopes has it - http://www.snopes.com/horrors/poison/halloween.asp

They want strife, they want you and I too live in fear of our very lives, you see we become dependent upon them yet again. they hope ISIS and Al~Qaeda operatives and the Muslim Jihad do in fact infiltrate our country get caught planning attacks or even carrying out attacks so that you and I surrender our Liberty's freely to them Demorats and Repuke~Republicans, The Demorats are the Party of Slavery!

If he didn't, he would go on TV an announce about being punishment for killing or talk to people of the USA about stop killing.

Husbands, sons, fathers, friends, and coworkers lost and people turn this political, BLM, who this person supported.  These were two people out on the streets every day to protect and serve.  Not sure we deserve their loyalty.  Maybe what we should be doing is coming together as a Nation to pray and support those that are filled with sorrow and grief at the loss of their loved ones.  I know they are in my heart and prayers.  I thank those that protect me always.

2 | Syed Hassan Rizvi | 2115 | 10154755651111336_10154755652301336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
3 | Pieter van Schlaraffenland | 820 | 10154755651111336_10154755657131336 | I can't understand why are some of you guys so blind. Clinton is not only corrupt, she is also  treat for the world's peace and American safety. She destroyed countries like Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya etc. If someone think that was a right choice, just look at them before and after Clinton's democracy. I don't even know how is she available to run for president after all that things. But the worst is that over 40% of Americans support her?!? How is that even possible? America, what is wrong with you? You need to be an example. I hope that she is not going to win because that would be legalising of the crime. She lied and she is running for president? That's so insane. She's even under a FBI investigation, she deleted over 30k emails. Well only you, the american people, have the power to change things. Make your country great again.

Why are we the taxpayers paying for Obama to break the law at 200 k an hour to try to elect a criminal that will destroy America?
5 | Tonya Waddell Woods | 312 | 10154755651111336_10154755663221336 | "Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn’t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, “Trump is arrogant.” My friend questioned if one man could make “that much difference in the world today.” To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, “Really, what has Trump done?”I said, “In June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.”As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ”At this point, what do you have to lose?” We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year—one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I’ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we’re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That’s your right. Just don’t ever say he’s not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh’s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise … and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase—they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America’s problem isn’t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it’s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they’re not simply the “silent majority” as you’ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them “deplorables.” The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year."

14 | Rob Holian | 24 | 10154755651111336_10154755701676336 | Again:For all you idiot Clinton supporters,How quickly we forget!  If you’re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane—you won’t believe what you have forgotten.  If you’re under 35, read on—I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn’t a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

17 | Laina Poleman | 16 | 10154755651111336_10154755691591336 | I wonder if any of this is true. More information about what I received about Clinton's emails.Clinton did not know that her chief adviser Huma used her husband's computer to back up all emails. She had done this a long time ago, and she probably forgot about THAT setting of backup. For Weiner's computer.Now the FBI goes to Weiner's computer to check his emails in his sex case, and they stumble on this file with all the backed up emails.Could the FBI keep quiet about this finding? No. Whichever way they would have decided, the Republicans would have cried 'murder', if it was known that they had the missing emails, yet did not say so. They had to come clean and announce it.Why is Russia so interested in keeping Assad in power?I have asked many influential people and they did not have an answer,Yesterday I received the answer.President Obama and Clinton were planning to build an oil pipeline from Turkey to Qatar. They were going to make a 'killing' on this deal. Literally billions of dollars. Now this is where the snag popped up. Assad did not like the pipeline passing through Syria (not sure if he was not offered enough to like it or any other reason for him being against it). The deal was stuck.The solution was to get rid of Assad and so Obama and Clinton decided to start an Arab spring in Syria, as that was the trend in the rest of the Arab world at that time. the USA encouraged rebels to take up arms and started a revolution to get rid of Assad. The plan nearly worked, but Russia cam into the picture as she did not want this deal to go through. So Russia intervened and saved Assad from assured destruction.Now this deal could now also explain the millions of dollars the Qatar has donated over the years to the Clinton foundation.Now Iran is also involved in this deal. She was supposed to benefit greatly from this pipe line as she was going to be one of the main suppliers of this oil that was to be pumped to Qatar. Now we see that Iran has a very big vested interest in our region and stood to make billions annually from it.At the beginning of the year, America, under the orders of Obama, transferred 1.7 billion dollars in CASH to the Iranians. It was made out to be some type of ransom, for the 4 Americans being held there at that time. This seems now to not be the truth. This money was made out to be ransom money, but it was money due to Iran according to the pipe line agreement and this was a cover for this transaction. Money was in reality being stolen by the Clintons and Obama, and used for their personal interests. CRIMINAL.And what about the resulting civil war in the region, that was to topple Assad. hundreds of thousands of people had been killed as a result, and million have been left homeless and refugees. This could be the reason why Clinton wants to allow so many of the Syrian refugees into America.There is more to come, and the information that I am receiving, is now putting many pieces of the puzzle together and the picture is becoming very clear. These people, Obama and the Clintons have destroyed the decent world over greed for themselves. Human lives have not been part of the equation. Money was the prize, and it was going to be got at all costs.Oh and another point was written and agreed on. If Obama was to be charged, Clinton, being President was supposed to grant him a pardon, shortly later.Can you sleep tonight? I certainly cannot, knowing there is the slightest possibility that Clinton could be elected President, and these evil plans and cover-ups could continue.Wikileaks will fill us in on all the information needed, before and I'm sure after the elections. Internal investigations are continuing by them.More to follow.....

23 | Ron Wilson | 6 | 10154755651111336_10154755692301336 | According to multiple sources, after the NYPD confiscated Anthony Weiner's laptop which was filled with Huma Abedin's emails they continued their search and discovered the property of Hillary Clinton in the form of emails that implicated her and Bill in the most heinous and serious crimes.  An NYPD source just claimed that within the emails on that device, Hillary and Bill are directly implicated ins a MASSIVE child sex/trafficking ring along with their friend, and convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. According to the source, “…It’s much more vile and serious than classified material on Weiner’s device. The emails DETAIL the trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary on their pedophile billionaire friend’s plane, the Lolita Express.” “We’re talking an international child enslavement and sex ring“ These claims were backed up by other NYPD sources as well: Jeff Epstein is a level-3 registered sex offender and the media ignores the fact hat Bill Clinton flew 26 times on Epstein’s private Jet and allegedly visited Epstein’s sex slave island. Now that Hillary has also been directly implicated, the media cannot ignore this any longer! The NYPD source makes specific claims about her involvement. He says, “Hillary has a well documented predilection for underage girls, and Mr. Weiner could not bear to see those details deleted.” http://redstatewatcher.com/article.asp?id=46461

6 | John Anderson | 8 | 10154753464871336_10154755599611336 | "Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn’t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, “Trump is arrogant.” My friend questioned if one man could make “that much difference in the world today.” To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, “Really, what has Trump done?”I said, “In June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.”As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ”At this point, what do you have to lose?” We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year—one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I’ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we’re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That’s your right. Just don’t ever say he’s not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh’s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise … and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase—they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America’s problem isn’t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it’s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they’re not simply the “silent majority” as you’ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them “deplorables.” The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year."

11 | Michael R Anderson | 2 | 10154753464871336_10154755606501336 | HEADLINES November 9th. Hillary loses election by a landslide. Hillary and press blame FBI Director Comey’s letter to congress.Let me tell you a little story and you decide it’s plausibility. So, a few months ago, FBI Director Comey tells congress he will not be seeking charges against Hillary. Why because he is a pro-Hillary fan and friend of the Clinton’s, while most Americans will admit, Hillary broke the law.A very large number of Americans believe the main-stream media is fixed behind Hillary. They feel the press are even willing to artificially inflate the numbers in the polls so more and more people will get behind her and to help continue the mega-billionaires to keep the money rolling in.In fact, if you compare the photos of Trump’s and Hillary’s rally’s, it is obvious Trump is filling football stadiums and Hillary is having a hard time filling high school gyms. One event was cancelled because only about 30 people showed up. What that means, is that Trump is winning by a landslide. Hillary knows she is losing. The press knows she is losing.What’s going to happen to the media and Hillary, if Trump does win by a land slide. It will be proof the media was lying by over inflating Hillary’s numbers. How can Hillary save face that mainstream America thinks she’s crooked and lost the election by a landslide? Moreover, how can the crooked media avoid being caught in their massive lies? Let’s go back to Comey for a moment. Eleven days before the election, Comey writes a letter to congress fully knowing the Republicans will leak it to the press, stating he wants to advise congress of this new twist in the email investigation against Hillary.Wow, that letter seems to have made the Democrats very mad as they believe the letter to likely be the single biggest reason Hillary lost the election, right? Well, maybe not. I say it’s all planned and here’s why I think that way:If Hillary loses, that makes her look bad and a mega-insult to her ego as well as to the Democratic party. It also proves the media was lying in polls showing Hillary was so far ahead of Trump.So, I have to ask, why did a pro-Hillary FBI Director release such a damaging letter? Think about it… Hillary loses the election by a landslide. Comey is actually helping Hillary with a plausible excuse for losing. Hillary can blame that letter from Comey to congress instead of facing the facts that America is tired of the direction the Democrats have taken our country.Wait for it…. What about the lying press? Well, if Hillary loses and loses big, the press too can point to Comey’s letter deflecting any thoughts of numbers rigging.In the Democratic party, Comey is a hero. Took one for the team. I’m confident there will be a place for Comey in the Clinton foundation somewhere.In the end, a Hillary loss will be a winner for both the Democrats and the press and American’s as a whole.

It's Americans 🇺🇸VS globalistsA socialist state by ObamaHillary to include George Soros agenda for America: Some are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people (Obamacare ring a bell)2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?🇺🇸 Let's Go!🇺🇸
16 | Louis Barraco | 2 | 10154753464871336_10154755695191336 | This came from the Advocate (our local paper) and I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump.  The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."

Let me guess, you are only polling Dems!! I have yet to be asked who I am voting for in a poll. I could care less what Trump said over 10 years ago. I am more concerned about the lies that have been told that will hurt our country. And don't forget about the lies that Hillary was in NYC on 9/11 and that she was under sniper attack at one point. Makes me sick!

Well it appears to me it is the other way around. Oh you blinded Clinton followers could put her in the White House, but she will only be Impeached liked her pathetic husband was. Then you would have stuck us with her yes man as our president. I am listening to what Pence and Trump are saying. We need this change.

20 | David Lester | 4 | 10154753464871336_10154755679711336 | So Hillary is really upset that the FBI Director James Comey is "dumping" on her right before the election.... So everyone wants to know Hillary, how does it feel to be aborted just 11 days before delivery?

22 | William Garrett | 1 | 10154753464871336_10154755622421336 | Honestly, I don't trust anyone with healthcare, government or the insurance company.Now if the government regulated the insurance industry and made sure they abided by their end of the deal, that would help the consumer.But jumping in line with their outstretched hands waiting for money like the insurance company, that's just corrupt.I only wonder when they will raid those accounts.I think government should stay out of the health care system.Actually, I think government should stay out of a lot of things, it's why we have state and local governments.If they can't be trusted with a little, they certainly can't be trusted with a lot, duh! The Bible tells you that.

1 | Cody Carter | 2100 | 10154755402241336_10154755404891336 | With Crooked Hillary as president.. expect to see many police killings and her apologizing for how bad our police are... On the other hand Trump will respect the police, restore law and order... and Drain The Swamp of Washington corruption
2 | Emily Ann Holt | 1716 | 10154755402241336_10154755408121336 | I personally blame Hillary, Obama, Lynch, and BLM for all of these police shootings/ambushes/deaths. They created this environment to allow this to happen and it makes me so angry to think about. This is just one of the many reasons I am voting for Trump.
3 | Ingrid Springer | 857 | 10154755402241336_10154755416851336 | Our country needs to bring the death penalty for all cop killers back - and to be carried out within a year after conviction. No such thing as being on death row for 20 years. And we need politicians who respect police.
4 | Arthur C Elling | 361 | 10154755402241336_10154755415951336 | When you have people like Obama and Clinton who demonize police officers, things like this are going to happen! Their is blood on their hands and others who support their anti cop rhetoric!
5 | Angel Jeremitha | 316 | 10154755402241336_10154755405461336 | Can you all stop with Hillary and Trump craps.The world doesn't revolve around the election and your idiotic candidates. 2 souls just gone. Be thankful for their service and have some respect.
6 | Guy D Rodriguez | 215 | 10154755402241336_10154755407831336 | It's unfortunate Iowa is not a death penalty State. I guess they will be sentenced to detention. Prayers for the families of the officers. BACK THE BLUE
7 | Seán Herlihy | 197 | 10154755402241336_10154755408266336 | Pipeline explodes and two cops murdered because they had to distract everyone from Killarys criminal activities....well we won't be distracted.TRUMP2016
8 | Keith E Holder | 97 | 10154755402241336_10154755418531336 | How many does this make it now? Under Obama I can't even count that high. Enough people we can't have four more years of Hillary Clinton and her anti police policies like Obama. Yea are there bad cops absolutely there are. But for cops to be executed like they have been is enough.
9 | Jay Boggs | 155 | 10154755402241336_10154755404701336 | Thank you Obama... Does anybody really think Hillary will make any attempts to change this?
10 | Caryn Gildea | 99 | 10154755402241336_10154755417271336 | Hillary says the police need to be retrained! There will be more of this if Hillary is elected! Obama should be impeached for not backing our men and women that put their lives on the line to protect us!
11 | Lynne Krantz | 63 | 10154755402241336_10154755437071336 | I am absolutely sick to my stomach right now – this happened just down the road from my home😣  May God bless our law enforcement officers💙🙏🏻
12 | Mamie Jones | 44 | 10154755402241336_1797296233845673 | Here in Iowa, we respect our police, consider them part of a bigger family - laugh with them and grieve with them. This type of violence has never touched our community and we are all in shock. Please pray for these officers and their families.
13 | Shelly Creson Whiteing | 26 | 10154755402241336_10154755485336336 | What absolutely horrible news to see first thing this morning. This is so sad -- this is not supposed to happen in our State, our Cities. May God be with these officers loved ones today and in the coming days. And, even more importantly may the Good Lord put a hedge of protection around all of our Law Enforcement today and forever. I pray that the coward who did this horrible deed be found and punished to the full extent of the law. I so wish Iowa had the death penalty for the cowards like this.
14 | Kevin Brannon | 29 | 10154755402241336_10154755481076336 | I wonder if Obama will have a press conference and announce that if he had a son, his son would look like these police officers. I wonder if Obama is going to hold a press conference and ask everyone not to jump to conclusions if the killer ends up having a Muslim sounding name. I wonder is Obama will take time away from the golf course to pay respect to these dead officers....
15 | Molly Malone | 22 | 10154755402241336_10154755426476336 | Suspect is white, not black, by the way. And he's just a coward who hates cops. Probably has nothing to do with political parties. He just decided to remove someone from earth through his own awful choices. And he probably will end up dead in the next few hours.
16 | Brandi Woodson | 26 | 10154755402241336_10154755418926336 | Obviously I missed a speech or something. How is it that so many people believe Trump is Superman,  how exactly is it that he will protect and save every person from harm. How is he going to stop crime and violence??? 🤔🤔 somebody please enlighten me, because I must of missed it
17 | Julie Boone | 13 | 10154755402241336_10154755426146336 | Oh God have mercy to our nation! I pray for the safety of all the police officers especially this coming election and all the American people who are going to vote.
18 | Mark Fudge | 22 | 10154755402241336_10154755424406336 | Broken ChainWe little knew that morning that God was going to call your name. In life we loved you dearly, in death we do the same. It broke our hearts to lose you, you did not go alone; for part of us went with you the day God called you home. You left us peaceful memories, your love is still our guide, and though we cannot see you, you are always by our side. Our family chain is broken and nothing seems the same, but as God calls us one by one, the chain will link again. - Ron Tranmer
19 | Sandy Kay Wagner | 13 | 10154755402241336_10154755453146336 | ITS so sad what our world has become... Two more police officers killed early this morning while sitting in their car in Iowa. Children's Holloween candy found with nails, needles, and other objects...This is what's become of our country since Obama has been in office. Terrorist attacks, innocent people killed, Cities destroyed, Illegal immigrants treated better than our Men & women that fight for our country, and our Veterans... Healthcare, Our seniors going without needed care...Etc.  #CrookedHilary would be much worse...She doesn't care about the American people! #VoteTrump to make America safe again.
20 | Peter Oldnall | 14 | 10154755402241336_1797286930513270 | Whomever voted for Barack Obama or is even thinking of voting for Hillary Clinton, the blood of these police officers is on your hands.When Obama declared the the Cambridge police "acted stupidly" he declared open season on the police.He let the world know that the police are fair game.
21 | Mike Sheffield | 19 | 10154755402241336_10154755441041336 | Two police were ambushed and killed in Des Moines, IA last night. I blame Colin Kapernick and his anti police supporters.
22 | Michelle Hardt | 8 | 10154755402241336_10154755483181336 | Lack of leadership from the top is the result of this. Our president needs to take time out of his campaigning for Hillary and address the crisis we have against our police officers! He has the influence to help stop this atrocity just as he had the influence that created it! One of the worst presidents ever!God bless our men in blue!
23 | Grant Doiron | 9 | 10154755402241336_10154755459011336 | I read all these comments and feel the same yes two officers was killed but people. I can see why others involve politics. It's sad but when all the police killings started taking place was when all the corruption was being aired about Hillary. We got over all that to find out it was pretty quiet for a while. And now it's back on Hillary right before the election. So it makes you wonder if it's just another way she maybe involved to pull the attention off of her. We all know she is capable of making things happen like this. RIP.
24 | Michelle Kaplan | 4 | 10154755402241336_1797290530512910 | Prayers for these offiicers friends and family!  RIP Officers! Thank you for your service! That being said, these animals need to be stopped! And sorry but it is true Hillary and Obama néed to stop bashing the police!!!! They just add fuel to an already large fire!
25 | Alyssa Bryant | 6 | 10154755402241336_1797285397180090 | Please Lord this has to STOP NOW this is uncalled for I pray for their families to remain strong and know Our Lord has them in his arms. #bluelivesmatter  #prayforpeace # heroesinblue

2 | Steve Walton | 948 | 10154753754056336_10154755357836336 | Hillary Clinton is a threat to American Democracy (what's left of it) and world peace. A vote for her is a vote for worldwide economic slavery and evil, endless war! She's a corrupt, evil, lying warmonger who already has blood on her hands of thousands of people and millions of dollars of blood money in the Clinton Foundation. #NeverHillary
3 | David E Palmer | 580 | 10154753754056336_10154755373871336 | Donald Trump was always a good person in the media countless story's of him helping people in need Just Google it. When he decided to run against Hillary the media made him into a racist no good monster. I'm a Christian voting for Donald Trump he is a good man.

She has obvious ties to terrorism and why she was allowed to handle top secret documents in the first place is unbelievable... More and more we're seeing that the clintons are criminals.. We know Hillary Clinton has brain damage.. I'm even starting to wonder if they we're crazy enough to slam planes into buildings along with Saudi Arabia
5 | Michael Crouse | 316 | 10154753754056336_10154755365456336 | Here's the facts She owns NO business, employs NO ONE, turns NO profit that benefits the public, yet has millions upon millions. Explain how middle class and low-income voters can accept this. She has done NOTHING to merit this kind of wealth.
6 | Hannah-Rose Harding Pepe | 200 | 10154753754056336_10154755374376336 | Hillary Clinton is a filthy excuse for a human being. She is as corrupt as they come. She will continue on Obama's path to dismantle the very foundation this country was built on. All in the name of greed and lining her own dirty pockets. God is throwing us a lifeline here people, and his name is Donald Trump. He isn't a perfect person by any means - which one among us really is?- but he is the right man for this arduous task. Grab on to this buoy and hold on tight!

She looks like an evil can you imagine being a Christian and to vote for this evil. She wants to fund and use our tax money to kill an unborn baby? She needs a mental intervention..

The women coming forward a couple of weeks before election to say that he groped them...in a room full of people?? No!! They should have slapped the crap out of him for even trying...his _____would be in his throat....but Hillary Clinton has shamed & threatened Bill's rape victims...(I do not care that Bill isn't running)..they've been trying to be heard for years, & she has blocked them at every turn, until Trump gave them time to speak...Hillary has stood on live television and said that she supports late term abortion...(it's a real thing...look it up) she takes money from the very people that hate Americans, they hate women, the ones that took out the twin towers, & the same ones that think children are ready for sex at age 6...there are many other reasons why we didn't vote for her...these are just a few...

That automatically makes him a better candidate. It has been stated that he is untested politically. This is only partly true but it actually works in his favor. We see him campaigning with the common people. That says a lot about his personality. His trip and speech to Mexico hints on his style regards to foreign relations .... firm but tactful. He is someone who will fight for the rights of his citizens/country. He has no political baggage and is free to form a new team to revamp / improve all government sectors. An opportunity to change things for the better

We must take great interest in Gods Law!!!!    Eternity is at stake. If we forget GOD, we will be cut off. “The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "Say to the people of Israel, Any one of the people of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel who gives any of his children to Molech shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones. I myself will set my face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given one of his children to Molech, to make my sanctuary unclean and to profane my holy name. And if the people of the land do at all close their eyes to that man when he gives one of his children to Molech, and do not put him to death, then I will set my face against that man and against his clan and will cut them off from among their people, him and all who follow him in whoring after Molech.”‭‭         Leviticus‬ ‭20:1-5‬GOD WILL NOT BLESS SIN. ...

19 | Pattie Goshtigian | 13 | 10154753754056336_1815874435330478 | I awoke this morning with the actual thought and concern that our country would be in grave danger if Clinton gets elected. One of the biggest reasons is the influx of refugees and the thought of Sharia law being incited and changing the way of life for our children and grandchildren. I really pray that those that haven't yet decided would please consider these two facts along with many other negative reasons. She is a dangerous woman and cannot be trusted with the lives of the people of this country. Nor the babies that will not stand to have a life. I'm praying that people will vote with a conscience and with the mind set that your vote isn't for yourself but your future offspring. Think of the battle that would exist for them and you may not be here to help. How will you feel voting for Clinton? She is going to see that the religious freedom will change when she has the ability to place a person of her choice in the Supreme Court.  Donald Trump may not be the ideal candidate, but he loves the country and the people. He didn't have to do what he's doing.  He said some offensive things, but he hasn't done anything nor will he do anything negative to hurt this country. Please think of the children and their future, born and unborn.
20 | John Anderson | 13 | 10154753754056336_10154755530791336 | "Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn’t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, “Trump is arrogant.” My friend questioned if one man could make “that much difference in the world today.” To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, “Really, what has Trump done?”I said, “In June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.”As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ”At this point, what do you have to lose?” We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year—one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I’ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we’re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That’s your right. Just don’t ever say he’s not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh’s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise … and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase—they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America’s problem isn’t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it’s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they’re not simply the “silent majority” as you’ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them “deplorables.” The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year."

The commander of the California National Guard reportedly cannot locate more than 4,000 of the some 9,700 soldiers involved in the enlistment bonus scandal.

1 | Mike Stevens | 1040 | 10154753574001336_10154755273546336 | I'd be more worried about other IMPROPER PAYMENTS to welfare, illegals and dead people. So lets skip the small stuff.
2 | Bill Morin | 434 | 10154753574001336_10154755274026336 | this story pretty much is making the idiots who are trying to get money back for their mistakes they made..not the Soldier...look really bad. Enough already...does anyone know where any of these missing soldiers are? will you please turn them in? yeah right !!! if anything i'll tell them Thank You and Screw the Treasury Dept and IRS. what a major embaressment to this Country.
3 | Diane Sylvia | 335 | 10154753574001336_10154755284896336 | There are worse scandals in life than giving real soldiers inappropriate bonuses!! Like the Clinton's taking millions from foreign governments in speaking fees!!!!
4 | Clif McGhar | 172 | 10154753574001336_10154755284031336 | So we have to honor our contract with the military but if the military agrees to a contract they don't have to honor it ?
5 | Martha O'Brien | 202 | 10154753574001336_10154755270766336 | The soldiers should not have to pay that back...they signed what was supposed to be a good military contract...& I love our men & women that serve, but that was the military's bad, not theirs!!!
6 | Cassandra Pena | 137 | 10154753574001336_10154755315696336 | This story makes me so angry. These veterans wrote a blank check made payable to "The United States of America," for an amount of "up to and including THEIR LIFE." When you sign this contract, you are required to uphold your end of it, and the government makes sure that you do. Some of these soldiers served multiple tours during their contract. Now the government wants to turn around and void their end of an already completed contract? "Oh we paid you too much for you to put your life on the line and serve your country. Our bad. Now give us our money back." SCREW THAT.
7 | Sandy Harper Waller | 79 | 10154753574001336_10154755352951336 | So odumbo pays billions to iran, illegal aliens, and builds mosques in the middle east but is SCREWING OUR MILITARY BY DEMANDING ENLISTMENT BONUSES BE RETURNED. why hasn't this traitor been hung for treason?
8 | Joe Neltner | 44 | 10154753574001336_10154755402991336 | The headline makes one infer that these former guardsmen are either hiding or didn't exist. After reading the article, one realizes they just moved on after doing their service. I understood the Army was not going to try to collect this money. So which is it?  A bonus given in good faith or what?  Don't ask folks to do something you won't do ; then demand a refund. What a crock of manure.
9 | Ashley Nanny Conklin | 34 | 10154753574001336_10154755332196336 | It's not a scandal like the soldiers were in the wrong. The military were the ones that screwed up! The soldiers deserve every bit of what was GIVEN to them and more! The military is a disgrace for trying to even MAKE the soldiers pay it back. Like they think all the soldiers just set the bonus aside all this time. Putting them on payment plans and so on...Yeah, real pathetic military
10 | Randi Hautala | 22 | 10154753574001336_10154755416206336 | Although some soldiers may have received bonuses they weren't entitled to....I say...keep the money. They probably did more for the country than many members of Congress. Also, knowing how much money the Pentagon wastes on silly trivial things, this is a bargain. It will cost more to track down the missing soldiers than its worth. Keep the money.
11 | Ronald Nordby | 7 | 10154753574001336_10154755433356336 | This is awful. If the government screws up, they shouldn't be allowed to collect on it. The rules regarding bonuses is often complicated and always requires approval. If these forms were approved, its there fault. A system which is so easily abused deserves to be abused. Plain and simple.
12 | Cliff English | 20 | 10154753574001336_10154755302761336 | Doesn't matter if you can find them or not. You paid them and they performed the service end of story. You only prove what fools we have running things. Donald Trump - Mike Pence For America Great Again !!!
13 | Megan Elizabeth Couch | 8 | 10154753574001336_10154755427761336 | They are probably homeless veterans since the govt doesn't bother to take care of most of them after they get home and leave the military. How are they gonna find someone that has no address? They cant. And those people couldn't pay for a place to stay so how would they even begin to pay the govt money they shouldn't b asking for in the first place.
14 | Frank Mills | 7 | 10154753574001336_10154755372021336 | Leave it, own the mistake and carry on. Idiots. Not for the bonus, but for even trying to recover it, foolish and now everyone knows that they are.
15 | Cody Sipes | 23 | 10154753574001336_10154755324251336 | Take a bonus from those fine men and women but let the welfare queens get away with scamming the system on a daily. We need new leadership for sure
16 | Jason Durandetto | 14 | 10154753574001336_10154755338721336 | So how much government money is being spent on trying to find these soldiers and doing all the legwork to get the money back? Our government is a disgrace!!
17 | Dan Mott | 10 | 10154753574001336_10154755405246336 | Why is this called a scandal? It should be called an injustice. These men and women do not deserve this and it needs to be fixed and any soldier who has payed any of it back or has legal fees paid out to fight it should be immediately reimbursed!
18 | Keith E Holder | 4 | 10154753574001336_10154755428986336 | A large part of them could be homeless because of the mental stresses they faced fearing or seeing death everyday like they did fighting for our country. Shame on America for allowing this to happen.
19 | Laura Meeks Jorgensen | 8 | 10154753574001336_10154755455601336 | Check the streets. That's usually where we send our veterans. Just leave them all alone. As a tax payer, I give you permission to allow them to keep the money. They earned it and much more.
20 | Coleen Courtney Mick | 5 | 10154753574001336_10154755320156336 | This seems like government abuse in retaliation toward our military for supporting a candidate other than the current administration. These people did not ask for such monies as incentives the government its self paid it out to them.  Why is it they can pay out billions of dollars in bail out monies to Wall Street banks and other corporations and then some them not pay them bail out monies back but then do this yes it's got be some sort retaliation no doubt.
21 | Lisa Essigmann-Martin | 5 | 10154753574001336_10154755360661336 | Good ! They made good on their end so they shouldn't have to pay it back. Why don't we try and get back from welfare fraud or the $6 million Hillary lost..And not allow a  retirement raise for Obama!! (I think it is illegal for him to propose anyway while in office)...
22 | Brenda Sparks | 9 | 10154753574001336_10154755363866336 | Well, if they served those multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan back then as we know many did under Bush, I bet many of them returned and are wounded in some capacity -- and homeless!We have many homeless vets here in California because the cost of living has skyrocketed and typically vets rely on Social Security which is lower than what a cheap apartment costs here in California.Our vets deserve so much better!Elect Trump, he will shore up social security, provide jobs, and put our loyal veterans first in line where they should be!
23 | Gary Dayze | 8 | 10154753574001336_10154755399626336 | That shows the incompetence that our government continues to display. Obama can put $1.75 Billion in unmarked bills on a plane to Iran, and he can spend $3.6 Million to play golf with Tiger Woods; but he can't pay our brave soldiers what he promised them? Let me tell you, this is one screwed up President.
24 | Jessica Nottingham Roberts | 2 | 10154753574001336_10154755616696336 | Probably can't be found, due to PTSD or taking there own lives, excuse me I am sad to say such a thing.. these men and women went to war, seeing things we never though could possibly been seen..maybe many moved out of the country for being treated ungreatful, no services..homeless, no health insurance..Hillary losses 6 millions dollars like nothing, why doesn't she has have to pay back..I am not understanding any of this !
25 | Reid Mason | 5 | 10154753574001336_10154755561106336 | Really, is there not more underlying problems we could be focused on, like illegals coming into this country, like the criminal Clinton machine, what about Al Sharpton who owes more than 4 million dollars, like the thug BLM. Let's get to work on law and order and prosecute the ones that we know where they are, the important ones and not the ones that have defended us.

10 | Eddie Ramirez | 17 | 10154753443866336_10154755153891336 | "Dear Republicans, - Author -Meira WainsteinYou remember how this started, right? You got in bed with the ‘I’m mad as hell and I’m not gonna take it anymore’ Tea Party. You saw the Harvard Law Review Editor who just happened to be black and you lost your minds. You called him a Socialist. You said he never read the Constitution. You said he was a Muslim as if that were some slight when Muslims have fought and died for this country right beside citizens of every other religion. It was never enough. You never seemed to run out of the venom you spewed.You played to the fears of white, male America. “He’s coming for your guns!” How many did the Great Gun Grabber actually get? You stared at twenty children slaughtered in Sandy Hook and turned up your palms and said, “This isn’t the time to talk about gun control.”You listened and half-believed the conspiracy theorists who talked about the great conspiracy of Sandy Hook and too many of you accused the parents of being actors. The best of you, who used to care about your country first and your party second, kept silent and eventually began to participate in the madness.You sold your souls because you saw after Romney lost that you weren’t going to be sitting your man in the White House anytime soon. Reince Priebus presented his autopsy of that election. To even be competitive, you have to carry 40% of the Latino vote and 45% of the women’s vote. Let’s not even consider the black vote which Romney lost by more than 90 points! Romney only got 27% of the Latino vote.DID YOU LEARN FROM IT?You certainly swelled your ranks with a fresh infusion of “populist” infantry who had the audacity to say Obama was going to invade Texas in Operation Jade Helm. You said that he was born in Kenya and a secret agent of the Muslim Brotherhood. You were more angry at Hillary than at the murderers at Benghazi. You stood there, silent and complicit as every maniac with a mouthpiece or radio show lied and incited their listeners to hatred and worse.  When your cries of wolf fell on deaf ears, you turned up the volume.The night Obama won, the establishment met in secret and promised to do everything to make him a one term president even if it meant hurting the country. That’s what your partisanship wrought and what did you achieve? You wasted millions in taxpayer money to flog the Benghazi horse and you voted to repeal Obamacare sixty times. While you strained to do anything to make the President look bad, you shut down the government and cost the economy $24 billion. While you played brinksmanship with the full faith and credit of our government, what you really achieved was to convince the vast majority of Americans that you are incapable of governing.This time you went to the natural end of your rope and jumped the shark with Trump costing you stalwart republicans like George Will, Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol and any steward of the Nation’s security. You nominated a man for his success in business even as many of his businesses were going bankrupt and are under investigation for fraud. You apparently learned not a thing from the political train wreck that was George W. Bush.But this time is different and you know it now. There is no hiding the fact that white supremacists and the full complement of other racists and xenophobes have embraced your nominee publicly and loudly.  The last Univision poll Jorge Ramos reported had Trump with an 83% disapproval rating among Latino voters. The party that claims to be the defender of “family values” sent dreamers back across the border or deported their parents  so they have to visit them across a fence. Not only have you proven that you care nothing for their lives but your nominee intends to deport eleven million of them."You built this, own it.

He talked about real issues that Americans are concerned about. What did Hillary talk about ? Bashing Donald Trump. Miss Universe from 20 years ago. She's got nuthin'. She can't run on her own record of 30 years of failure, scandals, and lies. Stupid Democrats...how can they be so gullible as to swallow this utter B.S. ?
13 | Sam Suzanne Roberts | 8 | 10154753443866336_10154755382121336 | Hillary doesn't even put a flag lapel pin on!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸The attack on freedom and our constitution was alive and well long before my birth...(A speech from 1964)"The profit motive has become outmoded. It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state." Or, "Our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century." Senator Fullbright has said at Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded. He referred to the President as "our moral teacher and our leader," and he says he is "hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document." He must "be freed," so that he "can do for us" what he knows "is best." And Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, another articulate spokesman, defines liberalism as "meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government." Well, I, for one, resent it when a representative of the people refers to you and me, the free men and women of this country, as "the masses." This is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in America. But beyond that, "the full power of centralized government"—this was the very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize. They knew that governments don't control things. A government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they know when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. They also knew, those Founding Fathers, that outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy. ~ Ronald Reagan

15 | Kyle Bailey | 14 | 10154753443866336_10154755213246336 | Actually I have experienced the lies, corruption and evil of the USA State Department several times in just the last 3 years.  "False advertising on government sites, scamming people for expensive visa applications with NO intention to give visas, giving visas, then refusing to renew a visa leaving people stranded in foreign speaking countries with only a short term passport visa and no job nor ability to legally work. Yes. Our State Dept is extremely corrupt!
16 | Shari Tinnin | 5 | 10154753443866336_10154755270746336 | It wasn’t until Republicans pushed through the 13th Amendment in 1865 that slavery was finally abolished in America. Democrats in the south tried to scuttle the new law with Jim Crow laws and other rules designed to keep blacks enslaved, but eventually that went down as well, writes Bill Federer at
17 | Russell Sonny Jones | 9 | 10154753443866336_10154755394491336 | It looks like the Whole system is at risk thanks to Obama and the Clintons. So what are we the people of honest integrity going to do about it. Get over our petty little feelings and vote. Do not stay at home or vote a third party or right in someone stupid like Kasich
18 | Kelly Tranum | 8 | 10154753443866336_10154755563296336 | The whole system is at risk and has been for a long time. Unfortunately the government has allowed people to depend on them for handouts and then these people rely on them so in turn vote for idiots that will keep giving handouts. There are people I know who work hard and do the right thing and could use a little help to make ends meet but they can't get it. I do know several people that won't work because hey will loose their help. This is part of the government plan to make us dependent on them and then you know the rest of the story..........
19 | Debra Pace Cleary | 3 | 10154753443866336_10154755405291336 | Thank you Laura, for clearly stating the obvious.  With emotions running high, it has become easy to take your side  with little consideration for the good of our precious nation.  I pray for a turning away from the destructiveness we have seen embraced by so many that influence our citizenry.  May God be with us as we make our decision, much is at stake!
20 | Pattie Goshtigian | 3 | 10154753443866336_10154755673071336 | I awoke this morning with the actual thought and concern that our country would be in grave danger if Clinton gets elected. One of the biggest reasons is the influx of refugees and the thought of Sharia law being incited and changing the way of life for our children and grandchildren. I really pray that those that haven't yet decided would please consider these two facts along with many other negative reasons. She is a dangerous woman and cannot be trusted with the lives of the people of this country. Nor the babies that will not stand to have a life. I'm praying that people will vote with a conscience and with the mind set that your vote isn't for yourself but your future offspring. Think of the battle that would exist for them and you may not be here to help. How will you feel voting for Clinton? She is going to see that the religious freedom will change when she has the ability to place a person of her choice in the Supreme Court.  Donald Trump may not be the ideal candidate, but he loves the country and the people. He didn't have to do what he's doing.  He said some offensive things, but he hasn't done anything nor will he do anything negative to hurt this country. Please think of the children and their future, born and unborn.
21 | Michelle Hasbun | 3 | 10154753443866336_10154755654366336 | With all of our laws, I cannot believe there is no statute that calls for the resignation of a candidate for President if brought under an active Federal investigation into certain crimes. The fact that Hillary is still on the ballot is evidence of how broken our existing system is. Trump can, and will, fix our crumbling republic-including the dying legal system.
22 | Rick LaRose | 3 | 10154753443866336_10154755372646336 | Laura is absolutely correct. Another thing we must all consider is this. If she is elected, the investigations will continue and perhaps worse there will be gridlock in Washington the likes of which we've never seen. There are far too many issues for this nation to address than to be mired in this swamp for four much less eight more years.
23 | Rusty J Grant | 5 | 10154753443866336_10154755194246336 | Amen. Clinton Greed has destroyed this country. They must be held accountable for the damage they have done. And the bodies they are responsible for.
24 | David May | 3 | 10154753443866336_1708217599438955 | "Putting money ahead of national honor." I can't think of a phrase that sums up Donald Trump's life any better. Show us your tax returns Donald and then we'll see if you care more about your brand or your country.
25 | Lanny Heinlen | 3 | 10154753443866336_571443056375375 | It is time for term limits across the board, even the Supreme Court should no longer be a life time appointment. I would also support term limits for all State and Local offices as well. This would help end the elite status some have. Is it also about time to end the double dipping that goes on inside the Federal Government?

3 | Linda Hyde Knight | 22 | 10154753660371336_10154755119916336 | Why blast it all over the place -I would say they were obviously hungry...why not help the person ..buy them food etc  rather than make fun of them...you may very well be in there shoes someday..you cant fly so high God cant clip your wings
4 | Donald Rooster Schmitt | 19 | 10154753660371336_10154755136576336 | Look at the hand writing...it's a kid that was obviously hungry and didn't have change...at least they were honest about it...if anything you're admitting that you're an idiot that left your car unlocked
5 | Shelley Lynn Turner | 20 | 10154753660371336_10154755102191336 | The question here is was it my only kit kat or do I have a back up one. If I have no backup KitKat then this person needs to fry and hopefully it was his 3rd strike
6 | Joe Bass | 17 | 10154753660371336_10154755124331336 | I've been homeless and so hungry I would have punched thru the glass for something to eat that was not found in a dumpster.
7 | Catherine Holmes | 13 | 10154753660371336_10154755624651336 | Dude was hungry...and you had no respect for that kit kat anyway...you left it unattended in your car.....who would do something like that??..My husband murdered an almond joy the same way last week....He wasnt charged...I tried to save it by putting it in the freezer...but the damage was done..............leave the dude alone..
8 | Sara Kathryn Patterson | 1 | 10154753660371336_10154755923896336 | Way to go media for putting the wrong spin on this... yet again 🙄. Kid was hungry and left a note. Your car was unlocked. It's not like he broke a window. A thief doesn't leave an apology note. The kid was obviously starving. It's a good deed, you involuntarily giving your KitKat to someone starving, not something to be upset about. I actually find it heartwarming and would want to track that kid down and give him a lifetime supply of KitKats. Just sayin.
9 | Ralph Johnston | 3 | 10154753660371336_10154755849861336 | Can't condone taking what is not yours and violating someones personal space. However there is a spark of morality in leaving the note and stating that they were hungry. If asked, I would have given it to them plus money to eat if I had it.
10 | Adam Walker | 5 | 10154753660371336_10154755865326336 | Does this mean a hungry person should walk through neighborhood's checking doors to see if one is unlocked? Then enter the home and raid the fridge? It's only food right? Just like you morons saying it's only a piece of candy...If I find you in my car, or exiting my car with my property in hand, you will answer to Kimber, the all mighty judge jury and executioner. Yes, a kit Kat bar could be your demise...I've had many things stolen from me throughout my life, so don't dare tell me I'm wrong.
11 | Karen Lewis | 0 | 10154753660371336_10154756152556336 | Kit Kats are my favorite.  Ran out of them quick on Halloween.  Didn't remember to save one for myself either.  But I have tons of M&M's, M&M's peanut, Snickers and Milky Ways leftover.
12 | Renee LaCross | 0 | 10154753660371336_10154756292061336 | Am I the only one who finds this ridiculous?  What makes this excusable? Say you left something in you yard, and because you didn't put it away. You must not care about it. So I took it to sell it and get some money for food, because I was hungry. Translation; " if I want it, I'll take it., but I have a good reason"  Crazy how something so simple, yet wrong is spun to make it seem ok. Well it's not, and we have soup kitchens and shelters for people on the streets. Help is available everywhere. When you enter anyones property without permission and take...guess what...it's against the law. A slice of pizza put a person on their third strike in prison. He was just hungry.....Quit giving in to these types of things. It's a crutch for anyone to justify doing something that is wrong. Even if it's a stupid candy bar. Jokes about it were funny, but having my house broken into and precious items taken gives me a different perspective on things. You might think well it's just things. Well it was the last thing my husband gave me before his sudden heart attack. It's the love he had in his heart giving it to me that made it special. It can't be replaced.  So sorry.. to me it's not ok.
13 | Courtney Rene Chase | 1 | 10154753660371336_10154756093761336 | It's funny, but I'd be mad as hell if someone stole my KitKat! You don't steal my KitKat! Then again, I don't leave chocolate in my van and I always lock the doors...

They should not only give him a replacement Kit Kat they should chip in with some help for his college expenses!People the person that stole the Kit Kat could have been another college student. And we all know they are always hungry!

18 | Gideon Jooste | 1 | 10154753660371336_10154755489366336 | Reporters from the Swedish weekly newspaper Nya Tider (New Times) have traveled to South Africa to investigate whether the “Rainbow Nation” is the success story that Swedish establishment media sometimes say – as far as they are at all interested in the land that has been in the media focal point until 1994. We met with politicians, farmers and victims. Thousands of farmers have been murdered in the Rainbow Nation, and the fear is always present.The sun shines low over the red-colored, dry ground. I am currently in South Africa, a land of contrasts with a history out of the ordinary. During the day, I met the country’s former interior minister for a meeting about the country and its challenges. Zulu Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi confirmed what I have written about for years, namely the difficult situation that the country’s white farmers are in. Mr. Buthelezi said that he fully understands that the white farmers are frightened in South Africa of today. There is every reason for it.Since the ANC took power in South Africa in 1994, thanks to extensive financial and moral support from the Swedish government, several thousand white farmers have fallen victim to farm attacks, according to the American organization Genocide Watch. The topic is controversial, especially for us in the Western world. To speak of vulnerable minorities is certainly always appreciated, but not when it comes to a minority originating from the Netherlands and neighboring countries from the beginning. Then the question becomes suddenly very sensitive.I strongly believe in every ethnical groups right to live in accordance with their culture and traditions. After traveling around in South Africa for long periods and after reporting from war torn countries in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, you quickly realize the value of security and peace. Civilized and non-corrupt governments, ethnical groups whose rights are recognized and nations that are not exploited by foreign interests are of paramount importance for a just world.A forgotten minority. One of the many children who will grow up in a squatter camp in South Africa. Picture from Pretoria. Photo: Nya Tider / Free West mediaA forgotten minority. One of the many children who will grow up in a squatter camp in South Africa. Picture from Pretoria. Photo: Nya Tider / Free West mediaDuring a five year period, I have traveled to South Africa several times, visiting farms and farmers to document farm attacks. During this latest trip, I have spoken with the victims of those attacks, as well as with relatives of people murdered in the most heinous acts. What is remarkable in these stories is that in many cases it is not about robbery. It would have been much easier for perpetrators to clear the home when no one is home, but still they wait until the owners come back. What happens then is in too many cases that the woman in the house is raped in front of the husband, and that one or more is killed – sometimes the whole family. On a farm I visited in Randfontein outside Johannesburg in mid-March the whole family was killed, and there was still money left on the bloody bed where an elderly man was beaten to death. The only thing taken after the murders was a car, but it was set on fire a few kilometers away. The trend is similar in many of the cases we have examined.Many white farmers are worried about the political developments in South Africa. The radical party Economic Freedom Fighters, who want to seize most, if not all, of the white farmers’ land, is gaining ground. They received six percent of the votes in its first election two years ago. I met with their representatives in Cape Town a couple of days ago, and they were confident that the party will be governing in a not too distant future. Party leader Julius Malema made himself known to an international audience when he, then as leader of the ANC Youth League, sang a song about killing white farmers. Human rights activist Dan Roodt, born in South Africa, says that the situation of the white minority has become worse since Nelson Mandela – a restraining factor – died two years ago. Attacks are now more and more brutal. Most white farmers know someone or know of someone who has fallen victim to an attack. The fear has spread in the rural communities.Blacks have grown to 90 percent of the population and there is little interest in protecting the white minority’s interests. On the contrary, today there are more racial laws than during apartheid. Businesses owned by blacks get preferential access to government contracts, there are laws requiring black ownership in large companies and many whites are locked out of universities because “their” quota is full.Five years ago I visited a farmer community outside the city of Nylstroom and two years ago I did a follow-up. When I came to the same area again last week, I was met by several tragic news. Several attacks have occurred in the neighborhood. An elderly couple had been murdered in their home, the older woman had been raped and burned up. The perpetrators had left empty liquor bottles at the scene and set fire to the house before they set off. We spoke with a 28-year-old woman who lost her husband in a farm attack that took place outside Nylstroom at the end of last year. This was the second husband the young woman had lost. The perpetrators had broken into the house when the couple slept and stabbed her husband to death with a screwdriver. The woman grabbed a knife and fought for her life, thus escaping being raped, but she was also badly cut. The perpetrators held a knife to the couple’s infant to force the mother to open the gun cabinet and then murdered her husband when his four-year daughter watched.Many white farmers would naturally flee South Africa if they could. However, most are settled in the country for economic reasons, including an elderly lady I spoke with, whose daughter had been stabbed to death eight months ago. She had been stabbed with a knife in front of her two little boys. The elderly woman now wants to move to Europe or Australia, but has no economic opportunity to even move to a safer part of South Africa.In Sweden, we are constantly told that there are no Swedes, that a “privileged white” person cannot become a victim of racism. The same attitude towards whites that is prevalient in the West, we also see when it comes to South Africa’s white minority. The official viewpoint is that it simply cannot exist any racism against whites, that the attacks against whites simply are a matter of common robbery, despite the statistics and that the farmers themselves suggest otherwise. When I met the press spokesman of the Transvaal Agricultural Union, Henk van de Graaf, he told me that the most dangerous profession in the crime ridden South Africa is being a farmer. More people have been murdered here than in neighboring Zimbabwe, where the regime deliberately hunted white farmers out of the country.We must dare to talk about the attacks against the white minority in South Africa, just as we need to talk about racism against the Swedes in my home country without being labeled as “racists”. In the upcoming issue of New Times, readers will find stories and interviews with victims and politicians from South Africa.Sanna Hill – Free West Media

7 | Joyce Menzel | 66 | 10154753457881336_10154755054901336 | She should be put in jail to never see the light of day again. They are children, who she was supposed to protect. It's bad when a child can't depend on its own mother to keep it safe. Children are a gift from God.

22 | Ann Di Maria Haines | 2 | 10154753457881336_10154755628791336 | This is why abortion doesn't bother many people who condone harming children. If we can "legally" kill them before they're born, why not harm them afterwards. They're still the same child. Children don't become someone else once they're born.

Surely you remember what happened the last time you fine people published a series of articles that pertained to a youngster with heroin coursing through his veins. You do remember little Jimmy of "Jimmie's World" fame, don't you?(Silly question...I know you remember 'him!')

Very selfish instead of selfless. I'll never understand how someone can do that to an innocent child no matter the circumstance.

She owns NO business, employs NO ONE, turns NO profit that benefits the public, yet has millions upon millions. Explain how middle class and low-income voters can accept this. She has done NOTHING to merit this kind of wealth.

I first heard of the phrase blow job in 1998 when I was 8 years old from the tv news. I had know idea what it meant, I thought they were talking about a lolly pop. Part of my innocents was indirectly taken by the Clinton's. Lets prevent anymore Clinton damage, vote Trump/Pence!

Something I saw in a comment section Those that are interested in the truth, will find it. Those that interested in PC will follow blindly.Christopher Allard Repost23 hrs · Edited · I don't typically go on rants or express my political beliefs here, but I just have to get this off my mind. As some of you know, I'm active duty Army. Aside from that, I am a medic. I've spent 3 years of my life overseas in both Afghanistan and Iraq. I've seen some pretty atrocious sites caused by war, from both sides. I've picked up blown up body parts of friends and I've saved the lives of guys who were trying to kill me and my guys right before I was keeping them from their 72 virgins or whatever they believe awaits them on the other side. Here is an unbiased truthful view to the Syrian refugee situation. My first deployment to Iraq, in 2006, my unit voluntarily ran a childrens burn clinic outside of the FOB. It was a constant target for attacks. You would think that people wouldn't shoot mortars or rockets at their own children, but you would be wrong. We saw hundreds of children, from infants to 18 year olds. The overwhelming majority of the kids we saw (90% or better) were clear cases of abuse. These parents were literally dunking their kids in boiling water, or throwing hot chai at their kids faces... Yes, we're talking about babies, toddlers, kids not even old enough to understand why their parents would do these things to them. HUNDREDS of kids... We saw quite a few of these kids that were sexually abused, both girls and boys. Their parents acted if nothing was wrong with this, even when confronted by our doctors. This is the mentality of their society, not the viewpoint of a few individuals... these beliefs have been accepted to the vast majority of these people. Many were educated, well dressed, well spoken men, but yet, they still raped their own children, and kept chai boys (if you don't know what that means, google it.) During that deployment, we also captured the 3rd largest EFP cache that had ever been captured. There were hundreds of copper plates, homemade explosives, fake curbs to house the EFP's, hundreds of mortars and rockets and howitzer rounds, even an anti-aircraft gun. All of these things came from one place, Syria. Almost every single IED or EFP we found or hit could be traced back to Syria... A lot of the terrorists we captured were from SYRIA... Imagine that. Fast forward a couple years, and I find myself in Helmand Province, in Afghanistan... We had a group of Afghani's that were paid to help guard our little mud hut in the middle of an Afghan village (I wasn't on a fob) These guys also kept a "chai boy" A boy, about 11 years old, who was there to serve these guys sexually. We heard him being sexually assaulted many times, but there was nothing we could do about it. We asked the police, the Afghan Army, and we were told the same thing every time.... it's their culture, and accepted as the norm.... Once again, we captured Syrian made explosives, weapons, and other items... We found Syrian passports during raids... And people out there want us to let these people into the US, with our kids, and near our wives. Near our schools, near our churches, synogogues, malls. Places where we should never have to fear being blown up, shot, kidnapped and tortured... Don't forget what they did to the Egyptian Coptic Christians, or the Jordanian pilot... Don't forget about what they do to rape victims! They stone these women to death for being raped! They behead their own people. Do you think they will show mercy to you? Look at the rape statistics in Denmark, Sweden, Belgium. Facts don't lie... 97% of rapes committed in Sweden were committed by Muslim immigrants... And you want 10,000 of these people here? Even if just 1% of these so called "refugees" were ISIS supporters or active ISIS terrorists, would that be acceptable to you? Chew on it... think about it. Take a good look at your kids or your wife and decide if the risk is worth taking. Feel free to share this if you want.

The clintons are nothing but Scandal! I choose to vote for Donald Trump!
8 | Schwabe David Shannah | 30 | 10154753353251336_10154754897101336 | The Clintons have robbed the American people blind. They have taken money from countries that kill women and children . Bill Clinton is a convicted Sex Offender ! And Hillary defends this behavior , just ask the little girl who was brutally raped , and Hillary defended this monster , laughing ,that she got him off. WOMEN ..listen up , this is not the woman, we want our daughters to look up to ! Hillary is a disgrace to our country.
9 | Wayne Miller | 29 | 10154753353251336_10154754866516336 | We hated that period of American History , it was a time some seem to forget because they never accepted that William Jefferson Clinton was impeached and disbarred and left with a very dark cloud over their heads . History will never change the facts were even softened and America moved on never to go back .
10 | John Cheek | 23 | 10154753353251336_10154754877151336 | It's not the money. It's like a kleptomaniac or any other psychopath. They just feel they are above everyone else and because they are so superior. they do as they please.
11 | Bill Morin | 9 | 10154753353251336_10154755287321336 | No..i was sick of the Clintons after 8 years of Bill Clinton embaressing this Country...I don't need to see him as first lady around the White House, his Wife is not deserving of the position and frankly she acts as if she Is owed the position. She shouldn't even hold a Security Clearance.
12 | Al Gi Carrillo | 10 | 10154753353251336_1224948684238540 | So, I am reading that Hillary is really upset that the FBI is "dumping" on her right before the election.... I want to say to Mrs. Clinton, "So Hillary, how does it feel to be aborted 8 days before delivery?" Stole that comment, but it is awesome!
13 | John Anderson | 13 | 10154753353251336_10154754923821336 | "Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn’t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, “Trump is arrogant.” My friend questioned if one man could make “that much difference in the world today.” To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, “Really, what has Trump done?”I said, “In June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.”As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ”At this point, what do you have to lose?” We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year—one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I’ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we’re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That’s your right. Just don’t ever say he’s not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh’s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise … and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase—they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America’s problem isn’t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it’s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they’re not simply the “silent majority” as you’ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them “deplorables.” The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year."

15 | Avi Rubin | 6 | 10154753353251336_10154754912931336 | Mrs. Clinton is weak and unreliable liar. Obama was the worst president of all time, weakening US caused the rise of radical Islam. Mrs. Clinton would be Obama follows causing a strengthening of Islamic terrorism and Will continue to destroy of the US. Only Trump will stop the Islamic terrorism and will strengthen the US.Do not make a critical mistake you need to choose Trump!
16 | Dwayne Lowe | 12 | 10154753353251336_10154754870066336 | The clintons can be compared to the mob. Only difference is that the mob has morals/ethics which the clinton's lack. But that's just my opinion
17 | Andrew Smith | 5 | 10154753353251336_10154754879231336 | Well, so did Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, and George Bush when they outted a covert CIA agent, but did they get in trouble? Nope.
18 | Susan Moore | 2 | 10154753353251336_1224891980910877 | And of course we should listen to Paul Ryan! The man who posed for photo ops at a soup kitchen but insisted on washing already washed pots and pans. Or maybe the man who lied about his time in the marathon he was so proud of finishing, but no one ever was able to verify his time or his finishing order, These are not lies that he would have ever had to lie. He lied for the effect, to prove his "goodness". The lies about school childrens lunches in Wisconsin were convenient when he wanted to cut funding to schools but were they showing his goodness to poor kids who went hungry at school? As far as he is concerned it is one lie after another after another.

It was to good not to pass on , POINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary?

The crazy thing back then, I thought poor Clinton, the Republican Party was trying to sabotage them. But wow I know differently now they are just greedy and want power, nothing good about them. They are bad, I am a democratic for Mr Trump. Vote for him.
21 | Laura Dreyer Ferguson | 6 | 10154753353251336_10154755062401336 | These people are billionaires. Don't let the media fool ya. She gets all her money from our enemies. Just hides it.

It is really sad the state of this country where peoples ages 18 thru 24 are gonna vote because of what they think they know or because of what Liberal teachers and professors have taught them. I am proud to have been born in 1978, raised in the 80's, experience the 90's and 2000's. This is most definitely the worse I have seen this country besides the late 1990's say 1997 thru 1999.

You either want a country with safe, secure borders or you don't. You either want a robust economy & more JOBS or you don't.You either want safe neighborhoods or you don't.You either want to defeat radical Islamic terrorism or you don't.You either want school choice or you don't. You either want a strong National defense system or you don't. You either want to keep the right to bear arms (& protect yourself) or you don't.You either want better & less expensive healthcare or you don't.You either want a candidate who wants to be President of the People or you want the candidate of the Wealthy Elites.You either want a CORRUPT FREE government or you are happy with the corruptness at every level (FBI, DoJ etc).You either believe a child has rights even 1 minute before they're born or you don't think a child has rights until after they're born. You either want the first US female President to be honest, trustworthy, and patriotic or you want her to be the most corrupt person to ever run for POTUS, morally bankrupt, who put America up for sale, & has disdain and contempt for all hard-working Americans! Hillary Clinton has lied and cheated her entire life! Voting for her is ANTI-AMERICAN! For the future first woman President, I'm picturing someone like Jackie Kennedy or Nancy Reagan, not this evil woman.

It seems the FBI has finally released a lot of information into the investigation they conducted into Bill Clinton's "Pardon For Payment" allegations in 2001. Trump is not much better, but this is who you are voting to get into the White House if you vote for Hillary Clinton - An established political dynasty willing to sell out political favours for cash.

There were hundreds of copper plates, homemade explosives, fake curbs to house the EFP's, hundreds of mortars and rockets and howitzer rounds, even an anti-aircraft gun. All of these things came from one place, Syria. Almost every single IED or EFP we found or hit could be traced back to Syria... A lot of the terrorists we captured were from SYRIA... Imagine that. Fast forward a couple years, and I find myself in Helmand Province, in Afghanistan... We had a group of Afghani's that were paid to help guard our little mud hut in the middle of an Afghan village (I wasn't on a fob) These guys also kept a "chai boy" A boy, about 11 years old, who was there to serve these guys sexually. We heard him being sexually assaulted many times, but there was nothing we could do about it. We asked the police, the Afghan Army, and we were told the same thing every time.... it's their culture, and accepted as the norm.... Once again, we captured Syrian made explosives, weapons, and other items... We found Syrian passports during raids... And people out there want us to let these people into the US, with our kids, and near our wives. Near our schools, near our churches, synogogues, malls. Places where we should never have to fear being blown up, shot, kidnapped and tortured... Don't forget what they did to the Egyptian Coptic Christians, or the Jordanian pilot... Don't forget about what they do to rape victims! They stone these women to death for being raped! They behead their own people. Do you think they will show mercy to you? Look at the rape statistics in Denmark, Sweden, Belgium. Facts don't lie... 97% of rapes committed in Sweden were committed by Muslim immigrants... And you want 10,000 of these people here? Even if just 1% of these so called "refugees" were ISIS supporters or active ISIS terrorists, would that be acceptable tob you? Chew on it... think about it. Take a good look at your kids or your wife and decide if the risk is worth taking. Feel free to share this if you want.
13 | Alec Gormley | 9 | 10154754633646336_10154754815076336 | How will libs survive paying for Obamacare, oh right Hillary will raise minimum wages. Then we will get inflation people on fixed incomes will be broke.
14 | Michael Angelo de Castro | 37 | 10154754633646336_10154754803336336 | Hillary is such a champion for women's rights and protecting children that she has chosen to attack the FBI investigation of a pedophile she is associated with, without a single word about his multiple underage female victims. Nothing changes with Hillary.
15 | William Boggs Montemayor | 8 | 10154754633646336_10154754825616336 | Obama said if you disrespect woman then and if Trump elected he'll do it again, i highly diut that.ButHilliary Clinton 30 years in office corrupting the system repeatedly, if she get elected she'll continueslly doing the corruption and not ever stop until she die.Hilliary is a dishonest, liar and metriarch of all American corruptions. #hillarygotohellbringyoursexaddictBillwithyou
16 | Randy Vaughan | 5 | 10154754633646336_10154754913436336 | Seems even Bernie mugged his own supporters after the Clinton/Obama cult made it worth his troubles. Now the basement dwellers, as Hillary calls them, find themselves thrown in either the taco bowl, or the deplorable basket, or a super preditor if they don't bow to queen Hillary. This Presidential election choice is so simple. Either you can vote for Trump/Pence and stand with your fellow Americans who wish to end the corruption in DC and a bias mainstream media. Or, you can vote for an unfit criminal who has a trail of corruption 30 years long, Hillary/Kaine. Or vote for one who has no impact and does nothing to end the corruption in DC, Or, you can not vote at all and do nothing to help cleanup the lawlessness in our nations government.
17 | Joseph Yuzon | 4 | 10154754633646336_10154754857946336 | Nominations was stolen from Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is not speaking out because all of the sudden he bought a property over half million. Did I say hush?🤐u talk beans spills. Hush$So much dishonesty in the Demorats
18 | Linda Stillwell Ray | 3 | 10154754633646336_1013564162099120 | Hillary has NEVER apologized to the American People. She accused Mr Trump of not apologizing, when he did apologize for his language & poor choice of words. But why should he apologized for unproven accusations?  Accusation: a charge or claim of wrong doing. Does not mean it's true, especially when the women are drummed up by an opposing candidate !!!!!
19 | Joanne McDonald | 3 | 10154754633646336_10154754851236336 | Bernie never had a slight chance to be the nominee. Hillary and the DNC trampled all over him, then he goes and endorses and campaigns with her. What a fool !
20 | Santiago Palomares | 1 | 10154754633646336_10154754937551336 | Newt nailed it, I sure like him.. And the deal Bernie where he sold his people out, I think their to embarrassed to show their face for being such fools.. They should be all over the DNC and the Clinton's, and yes Obama you know that fool was in it somewhere. You liberal sheep just never learn do you?
21 | Tankeh Ndimukum | 2 | 10154754633646336_1742280739367577 | Newt it's because only deplorable republicans like you with a xenophobic character see Clinton as corrupt and the rest of the world see her as a strong passionate woman. You may just resign instead for loosing on this campaign.  Fox news alone can not influence the election. You can plan another conspiracy in the next seven day. We don't plan anything against Trump except to use his vile words to define the animal and his deplorable supporters who see nothing wrong if he threatens democracy or human lives by planning to start a nuclear war or shoot anyone on the street and his supporters would still support him including Newt Hannity of Fox. The mega evil machine of the republican party media.
22 | Laina Poleman | 1 | 10154754633646336_1013839948738208 | I wonder if any of this is true. More information about what I received about Clinton's emails.Clinton did not know that her chief adviser Huma used her husband's computer to back up all emails. She had done this a long time ago, and she probably forgot about THAT setting of backup. For Weiner's computer.Now the FBI goes to Weiner's computer to check his emails in his sex case, and they stumble on this file with all the backed up emails.Could the FBI keep quiet about this finding? No. Whichever way they would have decided, the Republicans would have cried 'murder', if it was known that they had the missing emails, yet did not say so. They had to come clean and announce it.Why is Russia so interested in keeping Assad in power?I have asked many influential people and they did not have an answer,Yesterday I received the answer.President Obama and Clinton were planning to build an oil pipeline from Turkey to Qatar. They were going to make a 'killing' on this deal. Literally billions of dollars. Now this is where the snag popped up. Assad did not like the pipeline passing through Syria (not sure if he was not offered enough to like it or any other reason for him being against it). The deal was stuck.The solution was to get rid of Assad and so Obama and Clinton decided to start an Arab spring in Syria, as that was the trend in the rest of the Arab world at that time. the USA encouraged rebels to take up arms and started a revolution to get rid of Assad. The plan nearly worked, but Russia cam into the picture as she did not want this deal to go through. So Russia intervened and saved Assad from assured destruction.Now this deal could now also explain the millions of dollars the Qatar has donated over the years to the Clinton foundation.Now Iran is also involved in this deal. She was supposed to benefit greatly from this pipe line as she was going to be one of the main suppliers of this oil that was to be pumped to Qatar. Now we see that Iran has a very big vested interest in our region and stood to make billions annually from it.At the beginning of the year, America, under the orders of Obama, transferred 1.7 billion dollars in CASH to the Iranians. It was made out to be some type of ransom, for the 4 Americans being held there at that time. This seems now to not be the truth. This money was made out to be ransom money, but it was money due to Iran according to the pipe line agreement and this was a cover for this transaction. Money was in reality being stolen by the Clintons and Obama, and used for their personal interests. CRIMINAL.And what about the resulting civil war in the region, that was to topple Assad. hundreds of thousands of people had been killed as a result, and million have been left homeless and refugees. This could be the reason why Clinton wants to allow so many of the Syrian refugees into America.There is more to come, and the information that I am receiving, is now putting many pieces of the puzzle together and the picture is becoming very clear. These people, Obama and the Clintons have destroyed the decent world over greed for themselves. Human lives have not been part of the equation. Money was the prize, and it was going to be got at all costs.Oh and another point was written and agreed on. If Obama was to be charged, Clinton, being President was supposed to grant him a pardon, shortly later.Can you sleep tonight? I certainly cannot, knowing there is the slightest possibility that Clinton could be elected President, and these evil plans and cover-ups could continue.Wikileaks will fill us in on all the information needed, before and I'm sure after the elections. Internal investigations are continuing by them.More to follow.....
23 | Melvin Bailey | 1 | 10154754633646336_10154754881496336 | Y'all are full of bs....lol, you don't like Bernie either, you just mad because  he supported his party over personal injustice, that takes courage. Something your candidate can't get from his own party GOP. Maybe y'all don't really like him, just hate Hillary....Oh okayyyy how's that working out ? Mb
24 | Joe Labriola | 1 | 10154754633646336_1013824218739781 | The Clinton nomination was planned right from the beginning, starting with Joe Biden claiming he wouldnt run due to his family tragedy. Sanders comes out of nowhere, someone who had no shot of winning but Hillary needed someone to run against. Talk about being rigged.

About 10 members of the force came together to debut a new routine at the city of Dallas' Halloween party.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Frank Speyerer | 57 | 10154753806881336_10154754790736336 | I appreciate the Dallas PD dancers. It is refreshing to see men and women in such high stress jobs enjoying themselves. Keep up the good work.
2 | Brandon Case | 48 | 10154753806881336_10154754741591336 | Only Libtards will say this is somehow a black lives matter problem, or say it's offensive. Oh well take out the trash. Trump 2016 🇺🇸
3 | Melonie Myers | 5 | 10154753806881336_10154755591761336 | really? good gosh. can we we just get back to law and order and stop this pandering to a certain community? please! Professionalism is what it takes not freaking line dancing!
4 | Frank Gonzales | 11 | 10154753806881336_10154754756951336 | Dear Hillary Supporter, Did you miss the part where she lied to congress? You know that’s called perjury…. Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that? How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails? How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know... Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material? Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times? Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times? Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left? Did you miss the fact that her and Bill Clinton stole 6 Billion Dollars that was meant to rebuild Haiti?Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics? Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts ! But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump?Now, That is Insane!Hillary Clinton has a lot more to hide than Donald Trump does!
5 | James Harding | 0 | 10154753806881336_10154756241736336 | just not enough credit and support for our police men and women, they need us as bad as we need them, with out them could you imagine the crime , they put their lives on the line every day for you and me, and to think that some don't respect them, GO BLUE
6 | Jude Chidi | 0 | 10154753806881336_10154755686691336 | Halloween Halloween is your choice of celebration then you have made devil your choice and that is your choice and no man choosed him for you.All saints and all souls are the right choice to take you to God but you and your cohort want to sink God with your devilish celebration of halloween. Are you not ashamed that you will buy this evil costume and cloth your family is such attire and expect to die and be with God? You love enjoyment and at the same time not making effort to be where you will have perpetual enjoyment. That hell fire is waiting for you,if you doubt wait till you are dead or to pay visit to the Catholic Church and find out from those that have been there or pray for God to give you common sense.You halloween, you party, you club, you join all manner of cult, you love gay, you are abortionist, you protect other religion, but hate Catholic Church which is the only way to God, watch yourself for the world is now entered into borrowed time. The eyes will soon close and death will carry on and then the party, clubbing, halloweening will soon start for you in the place where Satan has prepared for you. Take your sons to God and your daughters to the almighty for them to be great. Take your grand children to serve our Lord Jesus Christ and they will always remember you in prayer. November1 is all Saint and November 2 is all soul respect God days. May God help you before it is too late. We are all in the battle

"I don't think there's any question that over the last 30 years the Clintons' careers have been characterized by the politics of personal enrichment."

Mike Pence weighed in on the latest investigation into Hillary Clinton, adding "there's been outright corruption" during her tenure.

1 | Robert Anthony | 769 | 10154754180256336_10154754669056336 | In the year 2000 I had the privilege of working on Mr. Trump’s security staff in the Trump Tower. Let me just say that he is a real man, a real boss, and a real caring and loving person.He and his personal bodyguard Matt Calamari (now Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice-President) treated us like family and when we came into contact with Mr. Trump we addressed him as Mr. Trump, or Sir, not because it was something we were told to do, but rather out of respect. I hold Mr Trump in the highest regard.On 9/13/2001 I was walking out of the pile of concrete, steel, glass, and human debris that was Ground Zero as Mr. Trump was walking in. I think he was with Kevin or Brian (bodyguards), not sure which, but I addressed Mr. Trump and gave him a few breathing masks, then exited the site. This was months after I left the TRUMP organization for family issues.No more then one hour later I was receiving calls from Trump Tower stating that Mr. Trump was very proud to see me lending a hand to help our people and that they would like me to come back to work in the TRUMP organization.This is personal for me, and as a 100% disabled veteran fighting medical bills that the VA refuses to pay I know I need a man like Mr. Trump to stick up for people like me and for the rest of our great nation.God Bless Mr. Trump and God Bless America!”
2 | Al Clark | 184 | 10154754180256336_10154754669871336 | The oldest person on record in the U.S. is 113 and lives in New Jersey but in North Carolina we've had more than 800 voters aged 116 most of whom are Democrats.  Isn't that amazing?  Good thing Obama said there's no such thing as voter fraud, otherwise I'd be concerned.  I hope news of this gets out.  http://www.carolinatransparency.com/votetracker/gen2016/age/116
3 | Wayne R Johnson | 99 | 10154754180256336_10154754667256336 | Accepting Donna Brazil's advance questions is more proof of Hillary"s Dishonesty, of Hillary's lack of integrity. If she had either, she would not have accepted this info. She would know this was wrong!Since she cannot stand up for what is right! Why would anyone want her for vote for her as president?
4 | Jimmy Guerrero | 62 | 10154754180256336_10154754681256336 | Mr.Pence,that was one freaking Awesome speech today,i thought i was watching John F Kennedy,and his brothet Bobby Kennedy, wow..👍👍👍👍🗽🗽🗽🗽🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
5 | Judith Fernandez | 43 | 10154754180256336_10154754687601336 | Is anybody appalled by the amount of money Hillary Clinton has spent on her campaign? The media won't complain because they are the recipients of much of it. The amount of money poured into political campaigns is sickening. How many kids could have been educated with this money?
6 | Cathy Good Welker | 55 | 10154754180256336_10154754677806336 | Just a thought...Why is no one talking about Huma Abedin's family? You know her mother who is a strong supporter of Sharia Law and her father who represents the Muslim Brotherhood. And why Hillary has accepted 25 million in donations from Saudia Arabia?  Huma as you know is Hillarys personal assistant and her blood runs deep in Saudia Arabia with her father even supporting Al Queda. And btw, where is Huma after the FBI announced their decision to do further investigations? Why hide if there's nothing to hide??

You either want the first US female President to be honest, trustworthy, and patriotic or you want her to be the most corrupt person to ever run for POTUS, morally bankrupt, who put America up for sale, & has disdain and contempt for all hard-working Americans! Hillary Clinton has lied and cheated her entire life! Voting for her is ANTI-AMERICAN!

She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary?

"The reason why they don't like Mrs. Bill Clinton is not because she's a woman, it's because she's dishonest and because she is hiding something: she's hiding the truth."

Sheriff David Clarke reacted to recent comments by President Obama that if Hillary Clinton is elected she will face sexism as the first woman president.

Hillary Clinton is a corrupt criminal and is tearing this country apart. How is she allowed to even still be in the race? This is just insane. I don't know anyone against a woman president,  but NOT her! Vote Trump to take our country back!!

You've heard about Arizona and the 116% increase with Obamacare? Our health insurance will be over $2,000 per month. $650 per person deductible before it pays anything. Doctor visits $100.00. Several of our prescriptions will be over $200 each per month. Last year we paid $21,000 for health insurance, copays, and medications. This coming year it will probably top $30,000 Who can afford this? We certainly can't. Guess we'll be eating rice and beans and have to sell our home. Thank you, Obama, you lying, remorseless person. If Trump doesn't win, this will only get worse.
5 | Stephen Gallo | 214 | 10154754528271336_10154754588201336 | Much like people don't like Barack Obama because of his policies and his LIES get called RACIST, when their dislike has nothing to do with his race.

8 | Robert Anthony | 210 | 10154754528271336_10154754593456336 | In the year 2000 I had the privilege of working on Mr. Trump’s security staff in the Trump Tower. Let me just say that he is a real man, a real boss, and a real caring and loving person.He and his personal bodyguard Matt Calamari (now Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice-President) treated us like family and when we came into contact with Mr. Trump we addressed him as Mr. Trump, or Sir, not because it was something we were told to do, but rather out of respect. I hold Mr Trump in the highest regard.On 9/13/2001 I was walking out of the pile of concrete, steel, glass, and human debris that was Ground Zero as Mr. Trump was walking in. I think he was with Kevin or Brian (bodyguards), not sure which, but I addressed Mr. Trump and gave him a few breathing masks, then exited the site. This was months after I left the TRUMP organization for family issues.No more then one hour later I was receiving calls from Trump Tower stating that Mr. Trump was very proud to see me lending a hand to help our people and that they would like me to come back to work in the TRUMP organization.This is personal for me, and as a 100% disabled veteran fighting medical bills that the VA refuses to pay I know I need a man like Mr. Trump to stick up for people like me and for the rest of our great nation.God Bless Mr. Trump and God Bless America!”

10 | Mark Thompson-Kolar | 96 | 10154754528271336_10154754587256336 | People don't like deceivers. Clinton's entire sphere of influence reeks of deceit.

11 | Jennifer Lynn Brooks | 64 | 10154754528271336_10154754623906336 | Obama needs to knock it off. People don't like Hillary because she is Hillary. Has nothing to do with her being a woman. I am NOT voting for a criminal just because I want to see a woman as President! She hasn't earned the right.....WHEN a woman becomes President it will be because she is trustworthy and has earned it, not because some idiot in office tried to play the gender card.
12 | Duane Tamura | 45 | 10154754528271336_10154754599921336 | Here comes the liberal standby excuse. With Obama it was race, with Clinton it is gender. Neither one has been held accountable for their pathetic records.

14 | Daniel Diaz de Leon | 37 | 10154754528271336_10154754601236336 | Hillary has never been a champion of women. Her foundation pays them less than men. She believes you can kill little girls up to the point they are ready to be born. Her foundation has received millions from nations that suppress women and where they are treated as less than second-class citizens. Nothing, absolutely nothing about HRC says anything good at all for women. Yet she wants you to vote for her only on the basis of her gender. That is what makes her sexist.

16 | Chere' Anglemyer-Wintrich | 39 | 10154754528271336_10154754595676336 | Why I'm voting for TRUMP 2016!! First and foremost - "I like him, he is honest and isn't politically correct. He has done a wonderful job as a father and businessman. HE IS REAL!!!"Hillary's political views I strongly disagree with: •Hillary Clinton joined the boycott against North Carolina because they passed a law preventing 21k registered sex offenders from entering into our little girls' restrooms. She wants to give them full access all across the nation and will use the justice dept. to do so.•Hillary Clinton declared that on the same day a woman starts labor pains that she is ok with a doctor severing the head of the baby to kill it.•Hillary Clinton has nearly 120 FOIA lawsuits against her and will spend all of her time in office fighting lawsuits instead of running our country.•Hillary supports Obamacare. Rates that are growing by 300% this year and are killing the dreams of the American family.•Democrats budgeted $17k per illegal alien for free benefits but only $14k for social security recipients.•Democrats have told every school in america that boys have the right to shower with girls and male admin officials have the right to use your girls restrooms at all times.•Hillary has taken the position that if you have religious views on abortion, homosexuality or bathroom privacy that differs from her own then you lose your right to work at a government job or to have a government contract.•Hillary thinks the constitution should change with the times. That isn't the way the fathers of our great country wrote it or meant it to be!•Hillary hasn't got a clue on how to create jobs, she thinks government creates jobs. We all know it's businesses that creates jobs, government creates debt!Hillary's resume, the one she doesn't brag about and the mainstream media won't tell you:•Africa - Rwanda, the Congo and Nigeria and your buddies/donors Joel Wilson, Nduka Obaigbena, Gilbert Chagoury, Mark Rich, and General Sani Abacha •Columbia, June 2010-Alvar Unbe•India - Armar Singh•Russia - uranium and $145. Million, 50% of American uranium and Texas-Wyoming-New Mexico-Utah, and Nursultan Nazarbayev•Hatti earthquake, Denis O'Brian and your brother-n-law Tony Rohdam•Whitewater•Travelgate•When the Clintons left the White House they stoled furniture, china, silver and artwork, they vandalized offices at the White House by removing the "W" keys from office equipment.•Hillary set up an illegal unsecured server when Secretary of State endangering national security•Hillary used unsecured devices in unsecured areas and countries endangering national security•Benghazi- 4 Americans died because she didn't secure the ambassador's quarters and didn't send help when under attack than she lied to America blaming on a video and than she called these Benghazi heroes' families liars•Hillary lied under oath at the Benghazi trials •Hillary allowed persons not given proper security clearance access to classified, top secret and even more sensitive information and she ordered them to destroy official government documents•Hillary ordered her people, that didn't have the proper security clearance, to destroy official government documents belonging to the American people that were classified, top secret and more sensitive when they had been subpoenaed •Hillary lied to congress under oath and the American people when she said she did not send or receive sensitive documents, the FBI confirmed she did send such information•Hillary BleachBit her illegal unsecured server when it had been subpoenaed by the FBI•Hillary's conspired with the DNC against Bernie Sanders•Hillary conspired to create violence at Trump rallies and violent physical attacks on Trump supporters•Hillary conspired to bribe an FBI official on her criminal investigation•Hillary took illegal donations for her campaign from foreign countries, countries that provide financial assistance to terrorist groups and have horrible human rights records•Hillary took donations and made deals with violent foreign oligarchies and violent human rights offenses (i.e.: child soldiers forced to fight in Africa)•and let us not forget her buddy Anthony Wiener, Huma didn't bring Anthony Wiener into Hillary's circle, Hillary encouraged that relationship personally (what a great judgement of character Hillary is, NOT!)•Hillary knew what Anthony Wiener was doing and she did nothing, which doesn't surprise considering she covered for Bill all these years. She is a pro at enabling sexual abusers!•Hillary pays her female staff less than her male staff.•Hillary attacked, degraded, threatened, stalked and destroyed the lives of Bill Clinton's victims. In addition Hillary hired private detectives to threaten, attack, vandalize their cars and homes, make threats in person and threading phone calls to these women. Hillary Clinton basically raped Bill Clinton's victims a second time in doing these things once bill was done hurting them!Pretty much sums it all up!
17 | Nancy Briggs Richards | 26 | 10154754528271336_10154754627051336 | Just like people that don't like Mr. Obama,,  It's not because of his skin color, it's because he is anti-american and has driven the U.S. into the ditch!  Plain and simple.. And I am sick and tired of politicians in it for the long run for their own means and not for We the People!  It used to be an honor to serve, now it's become a career to become rich and screw the people they work for!

22 | Cory Bruce | 18 | 10154754528271336_2152945271598156 | So if I criticize Obama, I'm racist. If I criticize Hillary, I'm sexist. But if I criticize Trump, I'm right?! Liberals are systematically destroying this nation with garbage like this.

24 | Sherry Allgood Varriale | 16 | 10154754528271336_2152953908263959 | I'm Woman,  My not voting for her has nothing to do with her gender. It is the thirty plus years of blah blah blah and nothing. It is the fact that to her a 36 week old baby can be aborted . The bible I read says that they are six things that are a abomination to the Lord. Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans , feet that make haste to run to evil , and one who sows discord among brothers.
25 | Deborah Rhoades | 22 | 10154754528271336_10154754627851336 | Her gender has nothing to do with the fact that she's proven herself to be untrustworthy, a habitual and unrepentant liar, and endangers peoples lives for personal gain. She's never once expressed any sorrow or remorse for what happened in Benghazi. She's reckless and has shown a continued pattern of bad decisions for years. She's vulgar, profane, and the willing victim of a limited vocabulary that would make most sailors blush. That's why I don't want her in the White House.

Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that? How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails? How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know... Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material? Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times? Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times? Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left? Did you miss the fact that her and Bill Clinton stole 6 Billion Dollars that was meant to rebuild Haiti?Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics? Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts ! But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump?Now, That is Insane!Hillary Clinton has a lot more to hide than Donald Trump does!
3 | Cathy Good Welker | 125 | 10154753790896336_10154754499096336 | Just a thought...Why is no one talking about Huma Abedin's family? You know her mother who is a strong supporter of Sharia Law and her father who represents the Muslim Brotherhood. And why Hillary has accepted 25 million in donations from Saudia Arabia?  Huma as you know is Hillarys personal assistant and her blood runs deep in Saudia Arabia with her father even supporting Al Queda. And btw, where is Huma after the FBI announced their decision to do further investigations? Why hide if there's nothing to hide??

Therefore they cheated.-Upon multiple occasions the news and media have sent Hillary Clinton articles before they were released to ask her to proof read them and send them back was approved. -The DNC hired people to go to Trumps rallies to cause violence. -Huma Abedin, Hillary's top aide and confidant, has been sharing emails on an unsecured private server with Hillary and Congressman Weiner, the congressman under FBI investigation for Sexting a 15-year-old.

The Muslims are not here as a peaceful religion, their aim is military, they want to and need to convert this country into the Islam religion. They have no pity on women or children. Sharia Law is a horrible cruel law which destroys women's rights, kills gays, is urged to kill all infidels or convert them to the Islam religion. Our western civilization will be destroyed if we vote for Hillary; think of your children living in that kind of world.

They'll say it does. And they'll say it with passion because they think that Obama is the only modern president to double the debt (even though this is complete lie). Then hit them with this. The day Ronald Reagan was sworn in - the national debt was 934 billion. The day he left office the debt was 2. 697 trillion. Almost TRIPLE. Bush 41 added over 80% and Bush 43 added 110%.

It is like asking the President if HRC did anything wrong. As long as the democrats are in power there is a very difficult path to doing any investigation. All of them are interconnected. Look at who is leading the Huma Abedin investigation? Who would provide a grand jury? Lynch? It would end up being made up of Clinton "friends"

SO how do they de-dupe repeated emails when they do not have the original source to compare it to anymore?? Sound shady to anyone else??  I mean COngress asked for the records and COmey said they destroyed  many of them or redacted them, so again I ask - If they are non recoverable - how do they compare to information as a repeat??

I am seeing a lot of the same arguments occurring, in every single post. Just different wording strategies! The stereotypes are laid out simply; A possibly “sexist” business man who plans to over turn the corrupt government all while “helping the rich”. And a “typical” politician who plans to string America along with her selfish accumulations following up on Obama’s “failed” system, and at the same time attending court dates while America is put on halt and Putin is helping himself to food in the White House fridge. Who would be the best choice? Do you find you are reading between the lines and second guessing each party?……….. But, #trump2016

(this is a joke!) Have someone talk to her doctor and see if there’s anything he can give her.”“Also, I’ve noticed she’s had an ‘odor’ lately,” he continued. “It reminds me of a combination of boiled cabbage, urine and farts.

13 | Dale Goodman | 20 | 10154754012036336_10154754337116336 | #exitpolling Hahaha. "Top 7 Charges Hillary Clinton Could Face While President1. Perjury: Why not start with a blast from the Clinton past? Hillary Clinton signed documents testifying that she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department, on orders from a federal judge, under penalty of perjury. We already have indisputable proof she violated this sworn statement… thousands of times.The cloud of false statements under oath surrounding Hillary Clinton is thousands of times thicker than the one around Bill. Democrats seem to have found a hidden clause in the Constitution that says Clintons can never be prosecuted for perjury, but Madame Secretary is really stress-testing that particular privilege of Clintonhood. One would think the federal judiciary had some interest in establishing that sworn documents must be taken seriously.2. Obstruction of Justice: Bill Clinton’s primary motive for committing perjury was to obstruct justice—it was the second count in his impeachment. (The justice he was obstructing was a sexual harassment suit from Paula Jones, at a time when liberals insisted sexual harassment was the most overlooked, under-prosecuted crime in the legal code.)Hillary’s thousands of perjury counts are also related to the obstruction of justice. She held back documents she didn’t want Congress to see. She subverted the Freedom of Information Act, which is a law, not a lovely suggestion.  Most media timelines of the Clinton email scandal are either incomplete or deliberately obtuse, because they almost never accurately relate how her secret server was discovered. For example, these timelines from USA Today, CNN, and ABC News all get it wrong.Sharyl Attkisson, who was a participant in the story, has an accurate timeline that makes the important point Clinton-friendly media outlets don’t want to talk about: we know about the secret server because the State Department was sued for failing to respond to FOIA requests. The State Department’s official story is that they were surprised to discover Clinton was withholding thousands of documents on her private computer.That’s straight-up obstruction of justice, in cases involving multiple federal courts, as surely as Bill Clinton’s impeachable offense of obstructing the Paula Jones suit. Clinton may become untouchable if the American people allow her into the White House, but the lawsuits don’t evaporate, and neither do the angry judges.3. Bribery: After the FBI set off a headline earthquake by re-opening the Clinton email investigation, we learned that several other FBI investigations of Clintonworld have been quietly in progress for some time. One of those investigations is digging into bribery allegations against the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents working on these cases were reportedly very angry that top Bureau and Justice Department officials were pressuring them to drop their investigations.The most attention-grabbing of these suspicions concerns an FBI official, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife received an inexplicably huge political donation from Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe, currently the governor of Virginia. The timing of this donation was so convenient that even the Left side of the blogosphere has produced some uneasy speculation that McCabe probably should have recused himself from all things Clinton-related.Well, he didn’t recuse himself, and the conflicts of interest are so apparent that the lack of a chiseled-in-stone quid pro quo might not be enough to kill this case off. After all, corrupt officials aren’t usually dumb enough to write down their quid pro quo agreem4. Pay for Play: There has also been recent confirmation that the FBI has investigated influence-peddling allegations against the Clinton Foundation, which was so obviously used for that purpose that it’s funny to watch Clinton apologists insist nothing can be proven in a court of law. Some of the most vigorous infighting within the Bureau reportedly concerns whether pay-for-play investigations should move forward.WikiLeaks has exposed emails from Clinton insiders that openly discuss how the Foundation was part of a network that steered millions of dollars to “Bill Clinton Inc.” Even longtime members of the Clinton syndicate professed themselves troubled by these operations. They were also unhappy with arrangements like Hillary Clinton’s agreement to speak in Morocco after a $12 million donation to the Clinton Global Initiative.It’s entirely possible that more documentation about these suspicious Clinton Foundation dealings will come to light after the election, especially if some of the people Clinton took money from grow upset with her. It’s downright dangerous to have a President with so many strings attached.5. Illegal Use of a Nonprofit Organization: There are many laws governing the management of charitable organizations, generally intended to prevent them from becoming money-laundering operations, ripoff operations, and vehicles for political influence peddling. The Clinton Foundation and its galaxy of related operations may eventually find itself answering some questions about compliance with those laws, assuming the IRS decides to stop focusing its efforts on hassling mom-and-pop pro-life groups and kitchen-table Tea Party outfits. If the Foundation is ever held to account for any other impropriety, charges of abusing a nonprofit should be part of the legal package as well.6. Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton’s abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a “racketeering enterprise,” which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained:Under RICO, an “enterprise” can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate – it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through “a pattern of racketeering activity.” A “pattern” means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute “racketeering activity” if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute.7. Fraud: Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel has been building a case that the “Clinton Charity Network,” as he calls the complete system of Clinton operations, has committed “charity fraud of epic proportions.” In part, he refers to discrepancies between donor accounts and the Clinton Foundation’s books.Others have pointed out how the Clinton Health Access Initiative has essentially ignored New York state law for years, without a peep from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (who just happens to be part of the Clinton campaign’s “leadership council.”) There are some interesting differences between the paperwork CHAI submitted to the IRS and what it submitted to the state of New York, which has more specific requirements about identifying foreign donors.In addition to getting a free pass on perjury, the Clintons are traditionally allowed to violate tax laws without penalty, eventually refiling paperwork when “errors” are discovered years after the fact. Another round of whoops-my-bad, no-harm-no-foul “refiling” during a Hillary Clinton presidency would be embarrassing, especially if she’s busy trying to ratchet up taxes on everyone else."

25 | Sergio Severino Chua | 6 | 10154754012036336_10154754418491336 | The narrative since Trump stepped into the political arena has been that he's "an immature rogue", or words of similar import.  The media have consistently placed him on the same level of undesirability as Hillary Clinton.  Let's remember no such undesirability was ever lodged against Trump prior to his run.  On the other hand, Hillary has had allegations after allegations of scandals and suspicious or shady activities even prior to her WH days as first lady.  So, I submit this is the Democrat ploy to tone down or neutralize the intensity of Hillary's negatives by putting Trump as "undesirable" as well.  Thus, the theme has been the two presidential candidates are both "undesirables".  And O'Reilly himself has been drawn into that same narrative.

This country also needs law enforcement officers that know when they are being used in enforcement that is unconstitutional.
2 | Lyonel Harman | 157 | 10154753484356336_10154754232031336 | They were there for the people. When it became known that the people didn't want them there they pulled. The government is ceasing land vital to ranching and farming with no respect for said ranchers and farmers. Their goal was not to loot steal and destroy. Big difference.
3 | Paul Lees | 153 | 10154753484356336_10154754202881336 | Hijacking a building and threatening officers with guns...and yet Republicans call them heroes. BLM stops a few commuters and they are terrorists. I don't get it.
4 | Jesse Kennedy | 61 | 10154753484356336_10154754290381336 | If if was Black Lives Matter that took over a federal land by force, they would have never made it to court!!! Two different Americas.
5 | Sarang Banne | 107 | 10154753484356336_10154754206936336 | To all those who support Bundy: please also support the anti DAPL Native American protesters of the Standing Rock Reservation! They are on the same team! Defend sacred Native American artifacts and culture!
6 | Alice McElvain Young | 35 | 10154753484356336_10154754272441336 | This government needs to understand, "We the People" are fed up and we're not going to take it anymore. The people rule this nation not the establishment, crooked politicians, or special interest. We're taking back America
7 | Diane M. George | 26 | 10154753484356336_10154754210506336 | PLEASE CHECK INTO A URANIUM ONE CONNECTION ... Why LaVoy Finicum was murdered standing up with the ranchers and our Constitution ... Was this land and the minerals under their ranches ... The reason for such a show of force against these ranchers by the Feds???
8 | Lynn Marie | 21 | 10154753484356336_10154754368326336 | Why don't you report the whole truth FOX??? Such as the fact that there were 15 paid FBI informants at the refuge with these men and that those 15 were the ones that brought the guns and made threats.. yep the FBI paid taxpayers money to have people go in there and create the threat! Unf'king believable that these  media sites do not tell the truth!!!
9 | Anthony Thomas Madden | 46 | 10154753484356336_10154754206946336 | Good for them. Combating ACTUAL governmental trouble, and doing exactly as our first president Washington warned of is a good deed done in my book.
10 | Josh Bledsoe | 9 | 10154753484356336_10154754230991336 | Unfortunately it probably won't be long before the feds murder you, just like they did at Ruby Ridge and twice in Waco. You've humiliated them multiple times and they will not tolerate it because it could cause the rest of the peasants to get uppity.
11 | Brian Blankenship | 15 | 10154753484356336_10154754258471336 | There's nothing more American than attempting to kill the very country itself. Pure poetry! Bundy is a national treasure and we need more men like him who are willing to take that extra step and tear this corrupt nation to shreds!
12 | Jack Jenkins | 15 | 10154753484356336_10154754314416336 | Why is it that the government can shoot and kill peaceful protesters like Finicum, but not the racist BLM domestic terrorists who burn down their neighborhood and stuff??
13 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 13 | 10154753484356336_10154754211481336 | The 1980s are again calling to ask for their foreign policy back. But this time the roles are reversed. We're now the guys with the closed, secretive, paranoid elite desperate to prevent the truth getting out to the wider world. In the Soviet Union, the apparatchiks of the one-party state warned you not to listen to the BBC on short-wave under the bed covers at night. In America, CNN's Chris Cuomo warns you that it's "illegal" for you to read those Wikileaks emails. So just leave it to credentialed media wallahs like him to let you know if there's anything in them of any interest. Which, judging from the networks' coverage, there isn't.So, as Chris Cuomo sees it, the same FBI whose officials were leaned on not to investigate Hillary for illegally keeping classified emails on a server housed in some guy's toilet in Colorado should instead investigate you for reading emails about her illegal emails. This is what a supposedly free press has been reduced to in order to drag Hillary across the finish line.
14 | Fred McDonald | 11 | 10154753484356336_10154754274571336 | BS. An armed takeover of a federal facility by him and his thugs is totally illegal. Acquitted on the federal charges against him does not mean not guilty. The US attorney who prosecuted the case blew it. He is still has to face the music in Nevada.
15 | Miglia Acuto | 5 | 10154753484356336_10154754511461336 | This is 1 of many major differences between White and Black protests! Non violent, no looting, no burning down communities, no additional crimes against person or property, no assault on law enforcement. There is no need for additional comments. The statistics speak for themselves!
16 | Valerie Gruelle-Richardson | 7 | 10154753484356336_10154754224696336 | Meanwhile, all the guilty rioters got away with their protest..even murdering in cold blood...and that blood is on Obamas hands
17 | Steve Allen | 9 | 10154753484356336_10154754308491336 | It wasn't peaceful and it's wasn't legal. If these people would have been minorities you people would be calling them terrorists and blaming Obama. 😂
18 | Brian Dammeier | 4 | 10154753484356336_10154754298411336 | A government for, by and of the people, does anyone believe that is how America is today? We see Hillary Clinton commit crimes and the FBI even admits she did it but no charges are filed. New evidence comes up and Hillary DEMANDS the FBI show everyone every thing. Really, she demands of the FBI, she does not have any official government powers that I know of. Don't forget the people who were occupying the peoples forest complex in Oregon. A government complex which means it's ours, the peoples complex. Well they all were found innocent except one, he was the leader and was going to a meeting the Gov. knew about and a helicopter was watching him, it told the police he was coming and they set up a road block in the exact way that he would go off the road into deep snow and get stuck. When he came out of his vehicle a assassin came out of the woods and executed him. He did not get a chance to plead not guilty, they wanted him dead. Just like JFK, the government wanted him dead too.. They wanted the VP as president because JFK with his brother pissed off the CIA, the Military complex and the mob so they changed the motorcade route and assassinated him. Then a shot time later they assassinated his brother bobby Kennedy. END OF STORY. I hope no one in this country is still stupid enough to believe the government. They are liars, crooks and thieves. As the story goes, they are politicians which means they are liars, thief’s and cheats and when they are not kissing babies they are trying to steal their lollipop. Wake up, real change is needed now.
19 | Steve Lierman | 0 | 10154753484356336_10154754471151336 | No it wasn't legal, you were found not guilty of interfering with the job of federal officials- huge difference. You can't take over a place that isn't yours, you bonehead. Go do whatever your job is and stay out of the paper- you aren't a patriot- you are a common criminal just like the occupy Wall Street scum.
20 | Preston Jones Hammett | 0 | 10154753484356336_10154755770981336 | These terrorist idiots should have been put in front of a firing squad. They stormed a government building and held everyone in it, including several officers, at gunpoint. All these scumbags are missing is a koran.
21 | Jeffrey Burgess | 0 | 10154753484356336_10154755111246336 | Trump says our court system is rigged....should I believe this verdict was rigged? Or maybe they were not found guilty because...they actually were innocent. Maybe Hillary was not charged because there was not enough actual proof to go to trail. You have to consider both possibilities...if you are an adult.
22 | John Weigel | 1 | 10154753484356336_10154754604736336 | Hooray for America!!!  It's now ok in America to carry out an armed insurrection of federal land and occupy a government owned building with guns!!!  Maybe somebody can do an armed insurrection of the Bundy's place.  Remember...it's ok now!!!
23 | Daniel D'Amico | 0 | 10154753484356336_1826511270959100 | So now on to the Dakota pipeline? doubt it!I doubt we'll see these guys or The Oath Keepers at the Dakota pipeline. Most militias have agendas and it's pretty clear what it is with their track records. Double standard at its best given the comments here, very sad.
24 | Bryan Wilkinson | 1 | 10154753484356336_10154755711551336 | So if blacks can't march in the streets (BLM) or sit quietly in protest (Kaepernick), this must be the answer. All we had to do all along was arm ourselves and claim a federal building to get the respect of conservatives.
25 | Steven Steele | 3 | 10154753484356336_10154754306001336 | Paul Lees what's there not to get. Blocking a highway then bashing the windows of the cars, pulling white people from vehicles and beating them. Starting riots and burning buildings to the ground are all acts of terrorism. #draintheswamp #makeamericagreatagain TRUUUUMMMMMPPPPPP!

1 | Daniel Reid | 4129 | 10154754049006336_10154754080006336 | So, I am reading that Hillary is really upset that the FBI is "dumping" on her right before the election.... I want to say to Mrs. Clinton, "So Hillary, how does it feel to be aborted 8 days before delivery?"
2 | Sandra LeBeau Cheek | 1952 | 10154754049006336_1860161763999475 | This man travels and does rally after rally...He NEVER looks tired! He is amazing and I have no doubt he would be there to answer that call at 3am and save anyone in danger (like Benghazi)
3 | John Taylor | 1236 | 10154754049006336_10154754077291336 | Hillary would throw Chelsea under the bus to save her own skin!

9 | Christine Cormany Barnes | 357 | 10154754049006336_1801778496755936 | Anyone over 45 remembers the Clinton years and the scandals, the impeachment, we don't want more of the same. Our country cannot look toward the future by recycling the past!!!!
10 | Roger Ferrell Elliott | 235 | 10154754049006336_1437781532916488 | Anyone care to estimate the gas this man is burning in his big jet, during these last frantic days of campaigning? I'd bet it's astronomical, but worth every cent, IF HE WINS!
11 | Keith Pratt | 222 | 10154754049006336_1860177507331234 | My 94 year old grandmother voted Republican for the first time in her life yesterday! God Bless her!  She said she didn't trust Hillary with the future of her grandchildren.

16 | María Piñeiro Karczewski | 141 | 10154754049006336_1489247861092042 | Hillary supporters are like Christmas lights. They hang together, half don't work, and the ones that do aren't too bright!   T🇺🇸 R🇺🇸 U🇺🇸 M🇺🇸 P🇺🇸
17 | Santo Catena | 255 | 10154754049006336_10154754077701336 | I'm sick and tired of those who say Hillary has no great accomplishments. I would say staying out of prison for the crimes she committed in the last four decades is a great accomplishment.
18 | Mike Reeves | 123 | 10154754049006336_1771661359750661 | If you ran a small business and someone applied for a job and they said " im being investigated by the FBI Would you hire them? No you wouldnt! I rest my case
