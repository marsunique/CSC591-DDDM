5 | Dan Carrow | 1 | 1555038691182822_1555052301181461 | Anything but bad Hillary news hey NBC hacks?!?!?  😂😂When you cast a vote for a proven corrupt candidate (Hillary) you become complicit and part of the corruption. Vote Trump, time drain the DC swamp.Keep in mind Hillary/campaign thinks....."Ignorant voters are our best key to win"Young people are "fuc&$ng stupid"Patriots are "Deplorable and irredeemable"Blacks are "super predators"Latinos are "needy" Evangelicals and Catholics are "backward" and have to get with the"liberal ways "Latinos are also called  " taco bowl  voters ".Don't be a Hillary shill.....
6 | Morgan Orlins | 1 | 1555038691182822_1555052974514727 | I wonder if Hillary's getting $$$ from them too? Hillary has gotten HUGE $$$ from countries that hang gays, throw them off buildings while they're tied together, and STONE them to death.But so many gays support her because they think she's better for them. Go figure...
7 | Kevin D. Johnson | 4 | 1555038691182822_1555057114514313 | Wow. They sound like trump supporters. All filled with hate and intolerance. A by product of ignorance.
8 | Micheal Rogers | 3 | 1555038691182822_1555047761181915 | For Uganda to be one of the poorest countries in the world, they have their priorities all wrong.

11 | Matt Matson | 2 | 1555038691182822_1555048151181876 | Here is something democrats and most of the media have a hard time honestly responding to....all the things said about Trump people say are criminal, from ties with Russia, his taxes, women he was said to have sexual grouped, bankruptcy or whatever....consider these undisputed facts...Obama and most democratic congressman hate him....if there was even the slightest bit of evidence all it takes is the president, or a congressman to present that to the FBI or DOJ and he would be under criminal investigation as a first step. Trump has never been under criminal investigation. People can get just about as many people for money or other reasons to say something bad about anyone...the media used to only say so and so said something about someone if it was news worthy. They would say their is no criminal investigation and the story would be dropped unless a criminal investigation happened.

Trump is a bully and a sexist elitist Fat Rich Pig. If Trump is the Values of the GOP and conservatives and the evangelicals then shame on them and I will gladly never be one of them ever again. For 25 years of my adult life I have voted for GOP exclusively, But the GOP of Trump is not MY PARTY. It is Yours! OWN IT and all the racist, bigoted, KKK loving aspects of it!

The Crusader, which bills itself as "The Premier Voice of the White Resistance," issued a full-page spread supporting Donald J. Trump.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Bette Harbin | 133 | 1555025624517462_1555029794517045 | If the KKK had endorsed Hillary Clinton, NBC would never have said a word about it. Anyway Trump rejected it, end of story.     It is a sad day in the United States of America when the news media only tells one side of the story. NBC, and CBS are a huge disappointment to the general public.
2 | David Tibergien | 147 | 1555025624517462_1555028747850483 | The candidate & his campaign should face tougher questions on why the KKK, Neo-Nazis, and White Nationalists are attracted to Donald Trump.
3 | Hiram Roman | 35 | 1555025624517462_1555038721182819 | Why people like you don't want to see the truth behind Trump? His only agenda is to destroy our country! This guy have move a mass of individuals full of racial hate . Get back to reality Trump would destroy the country!
4 | Marissa Peart | 27 | 1555025624517462_1555032524516772 | Support like that is what turns minority voters off. If I wanted to go to a Trump rally I feel like my life would be in danger because a group with a known and well documented history of hating bombing and lynching blacks could be sitting right next to me
5 | Lisbeth Castro | 35 | 1555025624517462_1555027597850598 | Boycott Trumps businesses ! Let's make Trump broke again! VOTE BLUE!! STRONGER TOGETHER!!!
6 | Amb Alam Kyriel | 25 | 1555025624517462_1555028394517185 | God already programmed that there would be a time for a black President and after a black President comes the first woman President in the history of United States of America; because American people have their Trust in God. "So shall it be Amen."
7 | Bill Kapak | 13 | 1555025624517462_1555033341183357 | Desperation is a stinky cologne NBC News.......didn't you already report Hillary had this wrapped up in August? I can't even say you've lowered your standards in reporting this because sadly, it's not the worst you've spewed.
8 | Deborah Burkhart | 7 | 1555025624517462_1555056374514387 | It's probably another desperate Democrat ploy ... Why would the KKK come out in support of him knowing that it would damage his chances. The public isn't that gullible. NBC is the deplorable one here. Sad that our media is so obviously corrupt.
9 | Jerry Casner | 8 | 1555025624517462_1555050544514970 | I think it is super funny, when the Trump campaign rejects support of racist, you libs still bash him. Yet Clinton loves taking money from the Saudis and you love her. He is not, nor has he ever been labeled a racist until he runs for president and wouldn't you know, it comes from all the sissy libs playing that tired old card.
10 | Lynndy West | 14 | 1555025624517462_1555028987850459 | An analysis of Trump's Twitter account revealed that his racism is no accident. Donald Trump has retweeted white supremacists 75 times since his campaign began.
11 | Danny Healy | 1 | 1555025624517462_1555055437847814 | Time to, get real and be honest. The media only want ratings so we have to remind people just who and what trump is....He isA sexistA racistA bigotA poor business man who would be nothing without a handout from daddy A liar, by some accounts 75% of the time he is speaking he is lyingA serial adulterer 3 wives 5 kidsA man that abusesGold star families The disabled Women who he see as physically not perfectCalls Mexicans rapist Was sued for not allowing African American to rent his apartmentsWas sued by a small paint business in Miami this year for non-payment and lost the caseHas threatened violence a this ralliesHas called on his supporters to assault or kill Hillary Clinton twiceHe set up Trump university with the sole goal of ripping off people and targeted vets as customers He is a self-admitted sexual abuserHe is accused and awaiting trial for the rape of a 13 year old girlEncourages Putin and the Russian secret service to try to change the outcome of our democracy ,which by the was breaks Logan's law and is treasonHas paid no federal taxes for years but says he supports our military our troops and our vets. Guess he does not understand that these things are paid for by federal taxesHas declared bankruptcy 4 or 6 times. And says he will run the country the way he runs his business, no thanksMakes all his clothing and trump brand good overseas so outsourcing American jobsUses Chinese's steel rather than keeping American steel workers in jobsFurniture in his hotels is all from overseas. Again, outsourcing well-paying American jobsI can find nothing to recommend this lying ignorant immature sleaze bag....Share..    Copy & Paste,  Spread the word..
12 | Taylor Seitz | 0 | 1555025624517462_1555083867844971 | It really doesn't matter whether or not Trump rejects the KKK's endorsement. The KKK certainly doesn't care. They know that, no matter what he says on the campaign trail, his racist, homophobic, xenophobic policies will greatly benefit their deplorable mission to restore white supremacy; they would not have endorsed Trump otherwise. The Trump campaign claims "their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign." Yet polls show at least 31% of their supporters actually do share most of their views. Clearly, they know that a victory for Trump is a victory for white nationalism. It is imperative for all sensible, patriotic Americans to stand together against the vile scourge of white supremacy that plagues our democracy.
13 | Matt Argyle | 1 | 1555025624517462_1555066254513399 | He hasn't denied them at all before this. Assuming this is a real story. If he's doing it now its just one of his last ditch efforts to con his constituency. (that means the people who vote for him for you supporters of his)
14 | Patricia Foulk-Reynolds | 3 | 1555025624517462_1555039857849372 | Panther representative and a kkk leader were in a head to head interview and both said they donated money and endorse Hillary. I have no faith in media to tell the truth.#CatherineOBrien.Look her up and hear how sick our government is. Her story includes republicans and democrats. Bush Hillary and pentagon.
15 | Barbara A Yelvington | 1 | 1555025624517462_1555050277848330 | You can reject anything you like Trump but the reality is your platform resonates with a certain level of people.. I thank God they do not endorse Hillary!!

17 | Jitesh Naidoo | 0 | 1555025624517462_1555061254513899 | The hallmark of a democracy is to accept the right of someone to differ from you. If the KKK supports Trump, then are they not expressing their democratic right in as much the Black Panthers support attacks against police of which little is said as it may be politically inappropriate to do so.

22 | Debra Benyshek | 0 | 1555025624517462_1555062521180439 | The Trump campaign can't denounce the publication of a newsletter that fully support Trump and everything his entire campaign platform is based on.Trump himself has not said no thanks for the support at his rally, because that would lose 2/3rds of his base.

5 | Alex Hammer | 27 | 1555008294519195_1555018471184844 | Funny how the FBI is messing around this election regarding the clintons either emails or the pardon that the PRESIDENT at the time Clinton gave;But refuses to investigate the russian connection with putin, the call for Espionage to be conducted by Foreign entities by Trump, the violation of the Cuban embargo by trump.I think maybe President Obama should order the IRS to release trumps taxes for the past 20 years (for the noninformed hes allowed to do). #POTUS #election2016 #hillary #Hillary2016
6 | Esteban J. Nobre | 42 | 1555008294519195_1555014247851933 | Deplorable! Freaking deplorable, Trump is Hate! this people needs to get back in the basket and never come out. Trump is the worth of america made rotten flesh. One more week, I just can't
7 | Gary Warren | 33 | 1555008294519195_1555016807851677 | I bet this was a Hillary supporter , only idiots would believe someone is going to burn a church down and than put who they support on there( like that does your vote good).
8 | Shikaro Awori | 27 | 1555008294519195_1555021581184533 | Wow. The excuses and ignorance in these comments are astounding! White supremacists have been burning black churches in the south long before Hillary ran for president, even prior to her birth! So how the heck is she responsible for this?
9 | Mustapha Konneh | 21 | 1555008294519195_1555019261184765 | After observing Trumpism for about two years, I have finally come to this conclusion: Trump's America is The United Hate Of America while Hillary's America is The United States Of America. The choice is clear, let's choose Unity over Hate....!

12 | Marie Garside | 17 | 1555008294519195_1555015697851788 | Shocking and extremely sad to think that something like this can happen.  Trump has emboldened some violent people when he refused to disavow the KKK.
13 | Keith Mikell | 5 | 1555008294519195_1555022454517779 | This is a setup. A diversion. Don't fall into it. With the kkk stuff yesterday and this today, it's all to cover Hilary's bs. They are scratching for the life of their campaign as of this point.
14 | Michael Anderson | 5 | 1555008294519195_1555046627848695 | This is nothing more than Hillary shills trying to frame Trump for inciting violence. The only people that hate Christians are the establishment democrats.

16 | Melanie Parish | 21 | 1555008294519195_1555010457852312 | Paid liberal protestor. They are desperate to undo the latest fallout from Hillary's email FBI criminal investigation
17 | Marshall Seay | 2 | 1555008294519195_1555025307850827 | Is there nothing that this bunch of democrats won't stoop to ? They , absolutely believe our black Americans are stupid ....
18 | Tim Stangl | 3 | 1555008294519195_1555030964516928 | What would Trump or his supporters gain from this?  What would the demwits and HRC gain from this?  Sometimes you have to look between the lines and figure out what is happening use simple logic and stop believing everything just because the tabloids tell you what to believe. I have no idea who did this I do however know who has something to gain out of it.
19 | James Wilk | 5 | 1555008294519195_1555013201185371 | This reminds me of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham in 1963. Time to read some Dudley Randall. https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/46562

21 | Amy Mullen | 4 | 1555008294519195_1555035077849850 | The most fascinating aspect of this story is how many people are sure they know what happened. Dang, there must have been a crowd of MILLIONS there watching this happen. Because, some of these folks posting here seem to be SO SURE it's this or that. I wish I could speak so recklessly and get away with it.

"I know her to be a person of high moral character, a reliable person and an honest person, however so much Mr. Trump may rant and rave to the contrary," Gary Johnson's running mate Bill Weld said.

14 | Wendi Sargent | 0 | 1554985447854813_1555046134515411 | Nancy S. WroteTHE STORY OF HILLARY IN A NUT SHELLA "MUST READ"To all of us, who are glued to the news, watching the election, the story unfolds as written by its author, Hillary Clinton.  She just couldn’t sit still and mind her own business.  After leaving the White House, she could have had a wonderful life.  She and Bill could have made millions in honest and decent ways.  Instead, the temptation to make hundreds of millions was too hard to resist.  She started to sell her influence, probably a little at first and it grew.Eventually, the Clintons started to get some huge payments with her run against Obama with the likelihood that she would run a better campaign later.  As Secretary of State, there was more influence to sell through the Clinton Foundation and through payments for speeches.  She probably prompted some of the largest payments into the multimillions by telling her donors that she was going to run for the presidency.  It worked.  Why else would Saudi Arabia donate more than $25 Million?  These donors were gambling, they played the odds, and Hillary had to play the part.  She had to run for president.  She would have been as good as dead if she didn’t even try. So, there she was, not knee deep, but over her head with Bill and even involving her daughter, running a criminal enterprise selling influence.  She was on a path which she could no longer abandon. This middle class woman was no innocent victim.  Her greed and her ego were in step with the pragmatic need to run for president.   As she and Bill were experienced presidents, she knew all the tricks to get into office, and she knew all the mischief she could inflict once she became the Queen of the kingdom.  She set this whole thing in motion, and just like the murderers we watch on Forensic Files, she thought that she was smart enough to get away with crimes about as serious as murder.  She rationalized just as criminals do.As with other criminals, once she was used to running her influence selling organization, after a while, she thought that she would never get caught.  After all, Bill had been the President of the United States, and his and her prestige put them on a platform of impenetrability.  Unfortunately, for her, like most criminals, she could not anticipate every turn, every person, every nook and cranny.  She probably would have gotten away with her crimes if she would have stayed as private as possible, but she just couldn’t just leave it alone.  She had to go public by running for the office of the President of the United States.  She had to put herself under a microscope.Now she is getting caught.She didn’t anticipate her mistakes or that someone like Donald J. Trump would come along to expose her criminality.  While we are watching the election, seeing the beginning of the rise of Donald J. Trump, we are also going to see the decline of Hillary Clinton and what has literally turned into a crime family.   She is desperate.  Her back is against a wall.  She has about half of the population and most people who matter totally involved.  One problem she has, though, is that her mentality has evolved and grown.  Once a person strays far from the path of decency, her criminal mentality leads to more and more actions which are off the wall.  She arranged for violent protestors to attend Trump rallies.  She probably arranged for false testimony from Mr. Khan and the women who claimed Donald J. Trump groped them.  She had no hesitation in labeling a decent man to be a bigot and a racist.  She did so well that almost half of America thinks extremely poorly about Donald J. Trump.  She was getting away with all this, too.Alas she made one mistake which was the beginning of her downfall.To make sure that there would be no criminal charges against her, Hillary orchestrated the payment of more than $675,000 to one of Director Comey’s trusted agents.  Due to Wikileaks, she got caught on this one.When James Comey decided to not prosecute, I had suggested that, in time, he would be ultimately seen as an American hero, the kind who used to be played by Jimmy Stewart.  He is probably a decent honest man who delegated responsibilities to his trusted men and women, and who believed what they reported.No doubt, Agent McCabe’s wife received this sum which is huge for an FBI agent, and then, Agent McCabe used his influence to wiggle his way to manage the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails.  It is no wonder she had such confidence that she would never be caught.  She had infiltrated the FBI  Now, we are just past the point in the typical Forensic Files case where the police have heard allegations of unimaginable criminality from a prior president (and wife) of the United States.  The police and almost half of America could not believe that someone with all that stature would become a head of a master criminal enterprise.  Their imaginations just couldn’t recognize something as ridiculous to be something which is tragically true.  Now, James Comey knows that she infiltrated his organization and corrupted one of his most trusted agents.  Once the police know who committed the crime, or in this case that there was a crime, they get on the path to prove and prosecute their case.  For so long, Director Comey was fed lies and he relied on the false information provided by Mr. McCabe.  Now, we are at the point where the police are looking at Hillary’s emails like a pack of hounds.  They are seeing the dark side. Now that Director Comey knows of the bribery, the bloom is off the rose.  She is exposed.  The police know that she is guilty.  Now, they are moving at rocket speed.  I am sure that Agent McCabe is no longer in charge of the investigation.  Other agents, honest ones, are hitting it as fast and as thoroughly as possible.Now, it is just a matter of time.  The FBI are on to her, and she is so guilty of so much, she will be exposed, hopefully before the election.  After all, she wants all the evidence put “on the table.”  She may get her wish.I doubt that they will be able to get things together fast enough, but there is a possibility that she will be charged and arrested before the election.Now, Hillary is able to put her mind out of reality when she performs her rally act, but there must be moments in the day when reality clicks in and she gets frightened.  She must be waking up at 2:00 o’clock in the morning in a cold sweat.  She knows that Mr. Comey knows.  She knows that she is going to get caught.  Her only hope is to become president fast enough and control the process.  Mr. Comey is a true American hero who will pull the plug before that can happen.  In fact, his annoucement last week may have done the trick.Donald J. Trump is right.  This is worse than Watergate.  This is unbelievably worse.  This is an American tragedy, which even Shakespeare couldn’t have written.As lawyers say, “The truth will out.”  Hillary Clinton is a criminal who has grown to a level we see only in comic books.  At this point, her goose is cooked.Watch her at her rallies as she plays her part.  Too bad that she has so many surrogates (some completely innocent) who speak for her.  In this regard, we will see if the Obamas continue to support her.  How did she get them to join her campaign?  Will we find that she corrupted them, too?One way or another, this is one of the greatest stories in American history.  Thankfully, we have Donald J. Trump to fix so much at this point.[If you appreciate this post, please do what you can to spread it.  Share it, Tweet it.  Email it.  Please get this word out.]
15 | Alan Chamberlain | 0 | 1554985447854813_1555089557844402 | So Clinton bleached her hard drive and smashed her phone with a hammer? I love the little details that certain people just know....FREEDUMB!  What I hadn't realized until a couple of days ago was that when they couldn't prove "gross negligence" (which would have been a crime) Comey couldn't say she was "innocent" (because the Republicans would have exploded)...so he basically made up "extreme carelessness" which is not a thing and said she was "guilty" of that....lol.

23 | Stan Blacha | 0 | 1554985447854813_1555057897847568 | rding to Daily Caller:Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.”The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants.That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits.Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.”Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.Sean Davis at The Federalist notes, “the bulk of the charitable work lauded by the Clinton Foundation’s boosters — the distribution of drugs to impoverished people in developing countries — is no longer even performed by the Clinton Foundation. Those activities were spun off in 2010 and are now managed by the Clinton Health Access Initiative, a completely separate non-profit organization.” (RELATED: Clinton Foundation Deceived IRS On Tax Exemption From The Start)As first reported by The Daily Caller, the IRS launched an investigation into the Clinton Foundation this past July after 64 House Republicans called the foundation a “lawless ‘pay-to-play’ enterprise that has been operating under a cloak of philanthropy for years and should be investigated” in a letter to the IRS, FBI and Federal Trade Commission (FTC).These Clintons are nastier than El Chapo Guzman family members!But El Chapo never portrait himself as some huge persona, Clintons are with a mask of Mother Theresa but with heart and soul of a Russian mobster!If you agree, please share and comment below.By sharing this story, you are helping Donald J. Trump to become our new US president.

2 | Marissa Peart | 724 | 1554968407856517_1554971591189532 | This is what happens when nursing homes give one cna 15 people to care for. If you never worked in a facility you would never know. Dementia patients dig inside their diapers all the time and will put feces everywhere and you only notice it after you've finished handling your other patient down the hall. This is a staffing issue. I enjoyed my job but it's a crazy amount of work for minimum pay. I do not condone this behavior but I understand how it happens.
3 | MarLisa Rice | 286 | 1554968407856517_1554969364523088 | If you don't want to care for the sick and elderly then FIND A NEW JOB!
4 | Zenobia Craig | 239 | 1554968407856517_1554969797856378 | This is why I will never put my parents in a home! I will sacrifice everything to take care of them myself!
5 | Gina Marie Ashby | 166 | 1554968407856517_1554974027855955 | It's the state that's at fault.. the states don't care about our elderly if they did then CNA's wouldn't have to take care of up to 16 people. Furthermore nobody wants to be a CNA anymore when you take care of a human being for $9 an hour you can go flip burgers for $13 an hour come on, all states are at fault
6 | Andrea Payne | 68 | 1554968407856517_1554975414522483 | I learned when my mother was in a nursing home that the residents who don't get visitors often are the most mistreated because no one outside staff drop in to see it or complain. Prayers for this lady and her family.  No one deserves this.
7 | JoLynn Scopelitis | 74 | 1554968407856517_1554974871189204 | This problem is huge in our country and its only going to get worse. Start by paying people a decent wage and screen people carefully. For the amount of money these places get from each patient it's horrible how they are treated. Also they are horribly understaffed. It really is an outrage. If you see abuse of any kind contact an ombudsman in your area. They can help and its a start
8 | Richard Feliciano | 37 | 1554968407856517_1554977181188973 | It's sad that our elderly aren't treated with respect. when my mom had her stroke she wasn't in a nursing home she was in a rehab center and I  found her in the same condition in her own feces on the floor and the nurses blamed it all on understaffing.. the whole time my mom was there she was weaker and weaker every day. Mind you this is supposed to be a rehab center. The center is called Cardinal Cooke on 105th and Madison in Manhattan. The place look great for people that aren't  elderly. But for the elderly the place really sucks and is full of neglect. The first week I took my mom home she was walking 25 feet everyday. When my mom was in that place. she barely walk five steps. Thank God we gave my mom to therapy she needed our selves and is much better now. We really need to watch where we put our parents and elderly because no one will take care of them like we will
9 | Sarah Smith | 16 | 1554968407856517_1555018127851545 | I worked in a nursing home facility while I was in nursing school and I saw things like this happen more often than it should unfortunately. People should really do their research on where they send their loved ones. My best advice is to check in on your family members regularly and have a active Role in their health care while they are there. Look over your family members and complain as much as you have to and make surprise visits. Don't show up the same time every day. I can only speak from my past employer and where I work now( which is a wonderful facility) the patients who are the best cares for are the ones with active families.
10 | Karen Carder-Wagner | 42 | 1554968407856517_1554973577856000 | This is horrible! Governor Christy won't sign the bill to improve the care of the elderly in NJ.  He's part of the Trump team.... what do you think is going to happen to other things like Medicaid. There will be no support.  Guess you should just pray you don't live that long!
11 | Deborah Willoughby | 22 | 1554968407856517_1554987721187919 | I've been a nurse for 30 years. I think I'm qualified to say quite bluntly nobody wants his job. Next to nobody and those that do I admire you. It's hard back-breaking work with little return on your efforts. Can be very depressing and cause irritability. I'm not saying it's right. But it is what it is. They run the CNAs into the ground.
12 | Von Finney | 23 | 1554968407856517_1554974194522605 | Nursing homes are like jails for the elderly. They get the same kind of treatment. The other unfortunate thing is that they pay very little for the expected work so it attracts some of worse kinds of people, to work under conditions that no kind of acceptable care is given in favor of maintaining a higher profit margin. If only more people would visit their loved ones more often, pressure their political leaders to do something about it.  People with a real passion to help others cannot afford to work in nursing homes, so they don't.
13 | Monica Griesemer | 9 | 1554968407856517_1554985141188177 | So very sad but I know it happens often.  Taking care of the demented is a very difficult job.  Please always thank those caregivers and do what you can to make their jobs more rewarding.  Its not the McDonalds workers that need to make $15 dollars an hour, its the certified nurses aids that work in nursing homes.It's also essential that family visit often to keep track of things. They r the eyes and ears for those that are unable!
14 | Kaelin Eileen | 14 | 1554968407856517_1554981371188554 | I'm not excusing the behavior of the staff or the quality of the facility - however - this raises the issue of end of life care. If you or your family member are thus far gone, what quality of life do you have? Even in the best of environments, is this how you want to live? Completely unaware and incapable of any function? We need to consider expanding end of life care. I would much rather my family members or myself be at peace than like this.
15 | Angie Watkins | 4 | 1554968407856517_1555043341182357 | I've been a nurses aide for 12years. I honestly feel bad for this woman. However dementia patients do fall they forget what they're doing and are confused, even if they've been taken to the bathroom and cared for. They can soil themselves minutes after they've just been taken care of.  We cannot be in every single patients room every five minutes it's impossible. The issue is not just this facility but the whole country. Our states say it's okay for our staff to patient ratio be what it is. There's more hard working caring stnas than there is not caring ones. Place the blame where it belongs our crappy states and bills.
16 | Kellie Wilson Self | 5 | 1554968407856517_1555007601185931 | I made sure my mother had a telephone in her room. I also stopped in EVERY day on my way to work. My husband was also very good about dropping in to visit. You have to stay on top of your loved ones situation. You can't just put them in the home and then not keep up with everything. I'm an only child and worked a full time job while walking with a cane because of a hip issue. It can be done. Oh and that telephone was like 30.00 a month. A small price to pay because it literally saved her life. She was able to call me when she couldn't breathe (she was end stage COPD) and they were not paying attention to the assist light. It even got ugly a few times. But for the most part the staff knew they better walk a chalk line with that resident. Also... make the administrator give you their contact info. If you have to be awake at 3am because somebody isn't doing their job. The the administrator needs to be awake also. They will get tired of you calling and do something! Also.... Medicare.gov. Look at the ratings. They're fairly accurate. ☺️
17 | Carol Joyce | 3 | 1554968407856517_1555026544517370 | Why would you see that happening time after time and leave them there?  Take them out!  Having said that I have worked in this industry 25 years. This is not acceptable if that is what really happened. However, there may be details that are not being told. With severe dementia some patients dabble in their own feces and it is not one on one care in any nursing home. Families sometimes resist medications that can help with these tendencies. There are a whole lot of unknown facts here. When were the pictures taken. The staff member may have left the room 10 minutes ago. I'm not making excuses but it can happen and was probably resolved as soon as it was discovered. There are many unrealistic families when it comes to Nursing Care. The legislature needs to pass laws to require more staffing to resolve the problem. That would in turn cost Medicare and Medicaid more to pay for. It's a sad situation no matter how you look at it.
18 | Cathryn Villarreal-Pacheco | 9 | 1554968407856517_1554975137855844 | If this were my mother, heads would be rolling! This is completely unacceptable! I hope this poor elderly woman is removed from their custody and is somewhere she properly taken care of. Disgraceful.
19 | Rabab Qaissieh | 6 | 1554968407856517_1555024874517537 | Why leave your parents to a care center in the first place??? Didn't they take care of u when u were both little children? Didn't they change your diapers and cleaned your feces? Didn't they take care of u? Nursed u? Send u to school? Feed u? What kind of culture is this? What a reward u give to your parents?
20 | Constance Dickerson | 4 | 1554968407856517_1554997514520273 | My heart breaks every time I see one of these stories. I was fortunate to be able to care for my mother at home until her death. Thankfully she didn't have alzheimers nor any major disabilities so I could still work full time  and care for her.
21 | Amanda Robertson | 3 | 1554968407856517_1554982664521758 | So disgusting. I love my job! The residents are #1 priority. I know they can be demanding at times. But so are kids, and i know we wouldnt put our kids in that type of situation. So why would we want to put our elders through that. Its horrifying. These are the type of people and establishments that ruin it and make it harder for the people who love their job and work their butt off. Its so wrong. My Prayers and Thoughts go to this woman and her family!!
22 | Kellee Turner | 3 | 1554968407856517_1555007971185894 | Everyone saying they would never put their loved ones in a home need to really understand what total patient care entails. A lot of people could not and should not do it. There needs to be regulated staffing ratios and that would alleviate a large portion of the problem.
23 | Denise Braddy | 1 | 1554968407856517_1555024151184276 | Sadly this happens more than it should. Medicare/Medicaid cuts to skilled nursing facilities hasn't helped as well as ongoing staffing issues. Prayers this woman finds a place that will love her, good places are still out there
24 | Bonnie Stevenson Myers | 0 | 1554968407856517_1555038811182810 | Some are short handed and some just don't care. And they get away with it. I think then should be closed that don't happen. Wonder why? And the state don't seem to care.
25 | Kate Pomert | 3 | 1554968407856517_1554984151188276 | This is uncalled for. My sister died from this terrible disease. But the nursing home always had her clean. And I always made surprise visits

1 | Deb Daniel Jansons | 83 | 1554908137862544_1554920811194610 | If they could do DNA testing to actually prove that it was her remains, it would be nice if she could have a proper burial close to her parents.  She was most definitely a woman ahead of her time and a wonderful role model.
2 | Jason Burks | 45 | 1554908137862544_1554923881194303 | "Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, departed from Miami in July 1937, heading east. But their plane, the Electra, disappeared about 800 miles into the flight, according to historians."  Uninhabited PACIFIC islands 800 miles east of Miami? They were REALLY lost!
3 | Miguel Rodriguez | 9 | 1554908137862544_1554931544526870 | Did the writer do any actual research?? Chelsea Bailey states that Earhart & her navigator departed Miami, Fl, and headed east and disappeared after 800 miles??? how did they make it to the south pacific in a Lockheed Electra ???
4 | Dan Naniot | 4 | 1554908137862544_1554927917860566 | Ok, a couple of Questions.. 1st they can find her bones but not her plane? And if she lived what about her navigator? Didn't he have any bones too?
5 | Eddie Local | 0 | 1554908137862544_1554985511188140 | well, I will just go back in time to before they had DNA testing and take a swab of her inside cheek before she left and then do a test of the skeleton. Wait if I could go back in time I would tell her to take more gas.
6 | Amy Charles | 0 | 1554908137862544_1555013734518651 | Am I the only one annoyed by this? Speculation... now. All of a sudden this COULD be her... stop posting it every day until they know if it 100% IS or ISNT. Plus, (clearly these people haven't done their research) how'd they end up so far from where they were supposed to be heading? She has remains but her navigator just vanishes in to thin air?? . . Just stop already with trying to gain publicity with these false accusations! It's stupid that you'd allow an article that makes no sense, to be published!
7 | Stan Gilbert | 2 | 1554908137862544_1554927361193955 | That's odd WE aren't worried about how she died, she'd dead, what does it matter all these years later how or why, or even where. Leave her memory and legacy intact. Some would rather believe she died doing something she loved until it went terribly wrong, rather living abd dying of whatever on Gilligan's Island.
8 | Robin Barron | 19 | 1554908137862544_1554910547862303 | As a women Amelia Earhart would be a role model for our daughters. NEVER HILLARY! -Hillary has no concern for women and children! Wikileak emails showed that Huma and Hillary knew about Huma husband Anthony Weiner sexing with underage girls, yet did nothing: So it would not come out in the news and hurt Hillary when she was Secretary of State. Allowing Anthony Weiner to abuse girls! Hillary is no friend to females!-NEVER HILLARY!
9 | Sheldon Oots | 20 | 1554908137862544_1554935787859779 | Brian Williams has confirmed these findings, he was there.
10 | David Rutman | 7 | 1554908137862544_1554922841194407 | I will never understand why a brand of luggage was named for Amelia Earhart, who is famous for being lost
11 | Alexis Mendez | 1 | 1554908137862544_1554922957861062 | Sorry, but that can't possibly be her. She got lost 1937 and a skeleton found in 1940?? No way! :)
12 | Frank Mullins | 3 | 1554908137862544_1554921054527919 | I'm surprised nobody said she had too much information on Hillary or Trump sexually assaulted her
13 | Richard Ortiz | 1 | 1554908137862544_1554953251191366 | I don't know if this is true or not little convenient that comes up during the election ain't it

21 | Nick Deatherage | 1 | 1554908137862544_1554923181194373 | And Hillary just ignored her distress calls and let her die! Trump 2016!

The race for electoral votes is getting tighter.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Troy Parmentier | 359 | 1554882081198483_1554891121197579 | At this point there shouldn't even be a question on who to vote for, I mean really. You need your head examined if you can't see how sick and twisted the Clintons are.
2 | Katherine Kelly White | 249 | 1554882081198483_1554891584530866 | Notice how Trump followers comments are either sexist, racist or just plain vitriolic. Are these the people you want to feel powerful in your country? These are people that would be shunned in a decent society.
3 | Melchizedek Hughes | 194 | 1554882081198483_1554883234531701 | Go out and vote for Hillary! who cares about corruption, being investigated by the FBI or deleted emails? We need her so we can fight and start a war against Russia unlike Dfump! #LiberalLogic #DraftOurDaughters #ImWithHer
4 | John Nichols | 58 | 1554882081198483_1554890321197659 | She won't win Michigan.. She didn't even win it in the primary. I used to vote Democrat. But this liberal Bologna has gone to far. The whole system is corrupt. I feel partially to blame, with the way I have been voting. My Eyes 👀 are wide open.... Take care of home first! Thats the rule we all live by. Why can't we do that when it comes to our country??
5 | Joshua Ricker | 48 | 1554882081198483_1554886917864666 | "I'm sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior of people who support Donald Trump," Clinton said last night with anger in her voice.Well.... you better get used to it. Especially if you win Tuesday. We will never accept you as our President. You and your husband are nothing but criminals and will be treated as such. You will never bring this country together because your existence in the political arena is a major reason we are divided in the first place. We will never get behind you. We will treat your proposals and ideas the same way you would treat an 8 month old fetus... we will rip them apart every time. You will go down in history as exactly what you truly are, nothing but a nasty disgusting excuse for a woman.
6 | Joshua Houchens | 50 | 1554882081198483_1554884624531562 | There is a reason the Democratic Party is corrupt. A big part of the reason for this corruption is they were founded on hate and many of those hate policies have evolved into what we see today. Most Christians are Republican not because of Donald Trump's character, but because of the Republican policies. Satan will use someone's past to distract people from what matters in order to destroy the future. Before voting, please research socialism and how it has never worked. (Many countries are currently dying and starving from it.) The current Democratic policies reflect socialism, along with all of its detrimental effects. Please pray before you vote.
7 | Regina Dear | 20 | 1554882081198483_1554898217863536 | He must be so proud..."Not all Donald Trump supporters are white supremacists, but all white supremacists appear to be Donald Trump supporters. The Ku Klux Klan gave their blessing, officially endorsing Donald Trump on the front page of their latest newspaper edition. You must be so proud, Republicans. Just today, Congressman Paul Ryan admitted he already voted for Donald Trump in his home state of Wisconsin. That’s a racist, misogynistic stink that won’t wear off in 2020, Congressman. Even if you can’t bear to say his name out loud. "...
8 | John Sherrod | 10 | 1554882081198483_1554900751196616 | The electoral votes should not matter. It is the public vote that should count but it never has. Gore lost to Bush because of this. He won the public vote but Bush won the electoral college. Your vote doesnt mean jack.
9 | Katherine Kelly White | 12 | 1554882081198483_1554900621196629 | Republicans voting for a guy that hates them, he thinks they're LOSERS, is he right?He's never contributed to their well being with taxes, used their money like a feckin parasite now he's insulting their intelligence by assuming they don't have any. Shame Shame Shame
10 | Elijah Wright | 7 | 1554882081198483_1554898881196803 | 'Tis ''tis ''tis Donald complains about poll and now there getting tighter and some cases Donald is up and now Donald is quiet on polls being rigged. Hence the reason I pay polls no attention. Get out and Vote Hillary no I don't like her, but given the other she's better.
11 | Andrew Johnson | 7 | 1554882081198483_1554903251196366 | Ok I find this heading very funny. First - make sure to vote no matter what anyone says. - now, If you give Trump all of the toss ups (best case for him--worst case for her) Hillary is 274 to 264 he still loses. With recent polling of 4 million voters in Florida (who already cast votes early) Hillary is leading in FL. Probability lessens even more for Trump - giving him all others he's only at 235 then to her (then) 303. Very slim he could pull this rabbit out of his rear. Now I'm not saying he couldn't win but if I was betting I'd bet she wins.
12 | Mike Keniley | 14 | 1554882081198483_1554899051196786 | The thought of a #WHINEYLITTLEBITCH in the White House (if he would even bother to live there) scares the hell out of me...OUR WORST NIGHTMARE! Vote your best interest and support the Middle Class...Vote for Hillary Clinton as OUR PRESIDENT!
13 | John Nichols | 3 | 1554882081198483_1554890794530945 | BS ... your own maps disagree with this nonsense ... you're doing nothing but capitulating to Trump's nonsensical claim that you people have rigged the election, thus rigging the election for him ...Journalism is about honesty, not ratings ... It's why Chuck Todd isn't a credible journalist NOR political scientist ... he is nothing more than a hack, just like his "sainted" predecessor ... he tried to say that 2012 would be razor thin, and then, when it wasn't (and it WASN'T) he insisted he was right, all along ... ZERO credibility ... NADA ...
14 | Silva Braga | 3 | 1554882081198483_1554893641197327 | Insanity admit accept a candidate with dozens of notes in a very serious negative certificate and more outrageous to think that will command a nation knowing that is the product of a conspiracy being the puppet together Putin, TRUMP, FBI. A demoralizing for the FBI.
15 | Alex Warrington | 29 | 1554882081198483_1554883181198373 | What?! NBC isn't fluffing up Hillary today?Are you guys feeling okay?
16 | Walker M Jones | 8 | 1554882081198483_1554894031197288 | So trump can make fun of disable people brag about how he don't pay taxes is racist an try to lie about how he views other race of people who are non white caught saying a lot of awful stuff an this is the Republicans choice for president that's horrible.You that votes for him are terrible keep thinking your grass so green cause all those supporters seem to be all the same idiots
17 | Joe Wenal | 1 | 1554882081198483_1554893111197380 | Is it possible for anyone anymore to realize that they're wrong or they've been fooled all I ask is do your research people research huma and her background where she's from how she got here and what her other job is research Benghazi research pay for play look at the people she put in high ranking security positions with no experience that have also donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to her we used to have common sense what happened to it don't you people know a bribe or a payoff when you see it Howard Democrats okay with the fact that her foundation collected millions of dollars for Haiti relief disaster fund and promise to build a hospital and hasn't laid one single brick in years. Just take a second and Google some of this stuff Google the Muslim Refugee crisis in Paris Germany and Australia and if you guys can give me a legitimate sensible answer of why that won't happen here after it happened in all those other countries I'll vote for Hillary

22 | Alegria Dela Rosa | 4 | 1554882081198483_1554907887862569 | I just watched a YouTube video called "Who Is Huma?" posted by Anonymous. I believe, that YouTube video is worth watching and sharing before you vote. You need to know who and what are you voting for.
23 | Tylene Bergeron | 0 | 1554882081198483_558817820909604 | The FBI doesn't publicly announce opening, closing, and re-opening cases. They making these announcements in this case for political reasons. Cases investigated by the FBI are never closed. They always retain the right to investigate further at any point. We've already heard about the FBI Director's ties to the Clintons & the Clinton Foundation. They might be trying to distract us from the wikileaks announcements or something else. They might be setting up a pardon by Obama before he leaves office (the way they left it in July, there was nothing to pardon - any president at any time could continue the investigation). These announcements being made by the FBI are meant to deceive the public.When the FBI director straight up says "in other cases like this we have recommended charges, but in this case we do not" that's when you know the depth of corruption in this government. They don't even hide it anymoreThe FBI found her incompetent, not criminal. Either way she is not fit to be elected to Dog Catcher, much less POTUS.
24 | Richard Gordon-Sheridan | 0 | 1554882081198483_1554930077860350 | Her lead would expand dramatically if you practiced legitimate journalism, and start spouting some facts about BOTH candidates.  Not fake positive stories of the dictator wannabe, and fake accusations of the next president.  You guys are getting to be more unbelievable than Faux News, and THAT is a real shame, AND a slap in the face to our democracy.
25 | Todd Huff | 0 | 1554882081198483_1204325882935765 | It is getting closer but close still wins it. It's sad that we, as Americans, are forced to choose between two terribly flawed candidates. Clinton has her flaws, as I am sure every politician does. Very shady, certainly questionable, not criminal until proven guilty though. Trump has somehow been able to say/do some very nasty things. It shocks me that people are so forgiving and feel that he is the type of person that should represent America. Hopefully we have better choices in four years...

1 | James Laubhan | 109 | 1554823387871019_1554829787870379 | The office of President of the United States requires a person of certain political training, experience, and temperment for this complicated job. From the start of the 2016 Presidential race, only one candidate has had the neccessary qualifications and dedication for this post and that's Hillary Clinton. America is a great country and will continue to be so under Hillary's guidence. At least she will be a serious leader and not a joke like that other fool. Anyone who can't see that difference should join Trump on the otherside of his wall.
2 | Alan Finch | 113 | 1554823387871019_1554827784537246 | Basically Clinton gets all of her money from "donors" she doesn't make money like Trump! she just has her greedy hands out begging dictators for cash..
3 | Johnny Grigsby | 97 | 1554823387871019_1554824231204268 | A Trump victory would result in a worldwide economic collapse in a matter of hours.
4 | Charley Faulkner | 29 | 1554823387871019_1554859124534112 | Trump winning would send our economy into a free fall. I don't understand how anyone could see that as a good thing. It's like Trump supporters have a sick desire to see the world burn smh.
5 | Frank Joseph Buypal | 55 | 1554823387871019_1554827887870569 | More like because of Clinton's corruption that has caught up with her. A Clinton win means years of criminal investigations by the FBI and congress that would lead to a constitutional crisis

10 | Michael Carabetta | 1 | 1554823387871019_1554954564524568 | Number 1, there is no proof that the market is moving because of trumps nearing victory, or hillary's upcoming prison term. This article is not based in facts it's written to push a liberal agenda. Number 2, Hillary is not allowed to hold office due to her email scandal and exposing national security secrets  18U.S.code 2071. Look it up if you think I am lying. Number 3, get your heads out of liberal news stations and do some research for yourselves. All of you that commented here did not read the article and your dumb is showing.
11 | Kevin McHugh | 1 | 1554823387871019_1554932721193419 | As people began to understand just how flimsy the US currency is, particularly with this administration's answer to economic woes being to fire up he presses and just print more money, they begin to understand just how close we are to a crippling inflation, they flock to other means of protecting their assets, including gold.

15 | Lea Andres | 0 | 1554823387871019_1554906791196012 | They should be more worried about the fact that Chelsea Clinton's father-in-law is a convicted felon! Through a series of Nigerian email scams and Ponzi schemes, Ed Mezvinsky, Chelsea Clinton’s father-in-law embezzled more than $10 million dollars. In 2001, Ed Mezvinsky was convicted of 31 (out of 69!) charges of fraud, and served five years in federal prison. His fraud charges included bank, mail, wire, as well as other offenses involving financing bogus oil development and other trade deals in Africa. But don’t think Ed doesn’t keep it in the family. In addition to his law clients and friends, he even bilked his own (now deceased) mother-in-law out of money. To date in 2015, the Fraudster still owes over $9.4 million in restitution to his victims.   No wonder you never see them at any town halls or on the campaign trail! Just imagine the shady stuff that will go on if Hillary gets elected and her in-laws have access to the White House! You know what they say, "birds of a feather, flock together"!!!
16 | Davis Emeribe | 0 | 1554823387871019_1554898751196816 | This is what all the fake medias like CNN, ABC, etc are hidden for the people to know, hillary Clinton make bill Clinton to refuse to acknowledge his son just because the mother was a black, any black that vote for hillary Clinton is an idiot and a fool, all they needs is black votes blacks life's don't means anything to them or matters to them, how long can we be used like a peace of paper, if you are a black then think about this, refused to be used, say the change begins with me and Trump is the change and not Clinton
17 | Martha Mayer | 0 | 1554823387871019_1554953584524666 | If you don't want the truth about Hillary don't read it. A Lie Named Hillary .. I oppose her because she cannot tell the truth to save her life. Any public servant who has the gall to issue a list of terms the press cannot utter, as if disposing the corpse of free will, is helplessly deluded and a petulant child. Sorry, Hillary, but no one owes you anything; especially the nation you proclaim to serve with nothing but the benevolence of blind ambition. If your candidacy cannot survive without the aid of deception, division, and the fabricated catcalls of “sexism” to demonize your critics, then please tell us why America needs you? Better yet, please explain how you’re even worthy of the job? A leader doesn’t need pollsters, a panel of advisers, two news conferences and a room full of media drones just to announce whether or not she used an unauthorized server to conduct official government business and therefore deleted emails in an attempt to avoid prosecution. A leader would never break the law in the first place. And a leader doesn't shout, "At this point, what difference does it make" when four lives are lost in the wake of her unmitigated failure. Any self-respecting adult with an ounce of integrity would simply admit the truth. Excuse me, any self-aware child who knows the difference between right and wrong, life and death. She was thrown off the Congressional Watergate panel for lying and she hasn't stopped lying since !!!!!. And some people want her as our President - she can't  & won't even tell the Truth as Secretary of State - and remember all she has done there to pad her financial pockets and political career - That should never have begun.If I’m hiring someone to run my business, placing my future in foreign hands, I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican, a man or woman, white or black. I want the most qualified candidate whose character speaks for itself and whose ideals can stand on the merits of their own wisdom. That’s common sense. Are you going to have the audacity to tell me what I can and can’t ask; what verbiage is acceptable? If your resume and vision are truly best for the entire nation, not just one party, gender or race, either should be able to withstand the most blistering questions and exhaustive scrutiny. In fact, you should welcome any and all discourse to discredit your detractors and display your competence. A leader unites, empowers and inspires by example, not by excuses or endless blame. Tell me the national debt is a record 19 Trillion and that Barack Obama has raised it more than the first 43 presidents combined. Admit that an estimated 94 million Americans are out of the workforce, nearly 50 million are on public assistance, and that the economic recovery is a sham. Admonish Iran as a destabilizing force of Islamic radicalism that must never be mentioned in the same sentence as “nuclear power". Recognize the reality every civilized nation has immigration laws and that American sovereignty, the safety and security of her people, supersedes any political ploy to stuff the ballot box beneath the hollow cries of racism.Yes, just like generations of legal immigrants before your candidacy, respect is given when trust is earned. If you are incapable of acknowledging simple, documented facts - solely because it’s easier to hide behind a propaganda platform that cajoles and incites an expendable public - you're not interested in solving anything, let alone serving the American people or any notion of truth. You and the likes of you are the cancer killing the country I love. You’re the lie my forefathers warned us about. Hillary Clinton has a long and inglorious history of alleged document tampering and questionable legal maneuverings.. AMERICAN VOTERS WE NEED TO KEEP HER OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.. SHE BELONGS IN JAIL - PLEASE - PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE !!!

21 | Jon Smith | 4 | 1554823387871019_1554843947868963 | Lol they are scared like the world is scared!!However--This election is basically over. 20 million people have already voted. They voted in early voting locations.You won't change 18 months of nasty Trump behavior or political campaigning in 6 days-- no amount of WilkieLeaks will stop this elections trajectory at this point. All that FAILED for republicans and Trump.3.5 million voters in Florida alone. Texas is setting records for early voting--double of what it has been throughout history.Fact is polls are gauging what once was! You're not going to change anybody's mind at this point. You're not gonna change those votes that were cast last week.Trump has one path to the White House and it is a slim one-- sweeping all the battleground states. That is historically unlikely.It's all over now except for the voting. The end college tally will be close to Clinton 294 to Trump 244-- 270 is needed; if Trump loses Utah, Florida, and other states that have been factored into him as leaning red-- the loss will be even greater for him.Math isn't a stong subject for Trumpanzies but it is UNAVOIDABLE at this point

They even have the power to influence Hilary Clinton, and thus reach into the very stratospheres of power that are unreachable by mere mortals. Too bad they only use that influence to make more money and peddle more sugar water. Health of the nation? Who cares? Soda taxes are all the rage, right now. In April 2016 Hilary Clinton was a staunch backer until one mysterious day, she goes silent. No more rhetoric about supporting the soda tax.  Leaked emails show that on April 20, a Coca Cola exec wrote to Capricia Marshall (Clinton’s special assistant while First Lady) “Really??? After all we’ve done?”. Yes, Coke expected the Clinton campaign to roll over like a beaten dog. Which is exactly what they did. They were bought and paid for, and they knew it."

And as Americans, they've all taken THE oath to defend America by its enemies- foreign and domestic. They are taking a stand- not against Trump, but staging a coup against the Clinton corruption machine, with evidence, and standing behind their leader, Comey, and he's taking a stand with them. Who is with them? Are you? #ImWithTheFBI
25 | Jack Belcher | 2 | 1554823387871019_1554873921199299 | How do you freak out over the prospects of a billionaire elected as president? This is just a desperate scare tactic to sway investor's votes. The truth is (which is something liberals don't want to hear), that the market will eventually crash - but it will be because Obama propped it up with imaginary money, bailouts, etc. when he didn't have the first clue how to do his job. Truth.

1 | Annie C. Galloza | 848 | 1554780761208615_1554783857874972 | The only thing that hurts HilLIARy Clinton is the TRUTH!!! She sounded like a lunatic yesterday!!! She's such a hypocrite! She spends every minute of her rallies bashing Trump, ZERO policies, and then she calls Trump dark and dangerous?! H--->Hypocrite!
2 | Tammy Weaver Owens | 670 | 1554780761208615_1554788694541155 | So it's dark and dangerous to point out Bill Clinton rape allegations but fair game to point out allegations against Trump?  Do liberals even read their own crap stories?
3 | Rob Maynard | 524 | 1554780761208615_1554784674541557 | But didn't the DNC pay people to start fights at Trump rallies?Didnt Donna Brazile feed her debate questions so she could cheat?Doesn't she use pay for play tactics and didnt she use them to sell out the State Department to the Highest Bidder.
4 | Joey Chris | 267 | 1554780761208615_1554783821208309 | So Bill Clinton is a rapist, but Trump isn't? Where's the intelligence in Trump's supporters?
5 | Joe Barry | 177 | 1554780761208615_1554786601208031 | IF she was honest she would have started the debate with saying she was given the questions in advance of the debate. But because we all know she is NOT TRUST WORTHY, this is just 1 example of her true self, not mentioning 33,000 other acts of deception
6 | Anne Proctor | 147 | 1554780761208615_1554807757872582 | Why has no one brought up Trumps upcoming rape case of a 13 yr old with his convicted pal Epstein... Where they paid young woman to go out in the streets and find vulnerable children for them to rape and bear for fun. Trump saying Epstein is a great guy .. He loves young beautiful woman as much as I do. You all think that's ok.. Hillary Clinton may not be perfect but she certainly isn't a filthy dirty scumbag that Trump is. Now he thinks it's years later and he has a right to be a rapist of children... I'm sickened and appalled.. If Clinton did rape anyone it was an adult.. But all those woman wanted to be a part of the limelight.. These children had no idea who trump and Epstein were they were dragged and tied and abused
7 | Mary Barber Frushon | 91 | 1554780761208615_1554810227872335 | Odd that Hillary argues Donald Trump doesn't have the judgement to be president, yet she is under FBI investigation for the second time.
8 | Karen Gold | 132 | 1554780761208615_1554798477873510 | We can do this, if we stay focused. We must turn out on November 8th! Don't allow the politics to make you take your eyes off the prize. We must...💙ELECT HILLARY CLINTON PRESIDENT💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙and Send the GOP back to where they came from!!!!
9 | Monica Orozco-Zabala | 92 | 1554780761208615_1554810557872302 | As far as I know one of the candidates for the presidency of the United States will be facing rape charges in court soon. There are at least a dozen women that have come forward accusing him inappropriate sexual behavior, he went on national radio and admitted he walked into a dressing room full of teenage girls that were half naked because he owned the pageant and also heard talking about his actions when he likes a pretty woman. So in my book this man is the rapist.
10 | Denis Drahus | 55 | 1554780761208615_1554811944538830 | Bill Clinton wasn't/isn't just a rapist but Hillary aided him not being prosecuted by threatening the rape victims!! So what the hell is she pointing her finger at!!

14 | Jody Parker | 31 | 1554780761208615_1554804581206233 | Hillary Clinton until they reopen the FBI case would not pose on stage with American flags. As of recent I have not seen her giving a speech where she has not had American flags behind her. This woman is a sociopathic pandering criminal nightmare for this country. And more than resembles the personality cult that Hitler was born from
15 | John Paul Matvia | 24 | 1554780761208615_1554824747870883 | Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton are the worst thing to ever happen to America where is Huma everyone around Hillary Clinton is in trouble except for Hillary Clinton she lies about everything America open your eyes there is nothing I can't stand more than a liar the Clinton's have been under investigation for the last 30 years it's time to drain the swamp. Trump 2016!
16 | Melinda B Zortman | 23 | 1554780761208615_1554817291204962 | Ummmm cannot rape the willing and deny it and have your wife bury the women for it.  Not to mention he lost his license to practice law and was impeached by Congress for lying.
17 | Heather Wade | 31 | 1554780761208615_1554802457873112 | She was furious and that goes to show her temper and how easily she is upset. Do we really need someone who gets bothered so easily in our white house being our president and having the responsibility of our people in those hands? Hell no we do not.
18 | James Laubhan | 27 | 1554780761208615_1554813254538699 | The office of President of the United States requires a person of certain political training, experience, and temperment for this complicated job. From the start of the 2016 Presidential race, only one candidate has had the neccessary qualifications and dedication for this post and that's Hillary Clinton. America is a great country and will continue to be so under Hillary's guidence. At least she will be a serious leader and not a joke like that other fool. Anyone who can't see that difference should join Trump on the otherside of his wall.
19 | Michael Padilla | 38 | 1554780761208615_1554798894540135 | Hillary Clinton is full of it. How does she even know that those protesters are Trump supporters? Not the Green Party (who despise her too). Or the Libertarians. Or just people like me who are undecided but never Hillary.
20 | Amanda Murdock | 18 | 1554780761208615_1554797104540314 | I am not a Trump supporter. Neither Trump nor Bill Clinton have been convicted of rape so when Trump opponents call him a rapist and when Trump supporters call Bill Clinton a rapist it makes me glad that we have an innocent until proven guilty justice system. Not calling the women accusing them liars but just because you dislike someone and couldn't put it past them to do something so horrible it doesn't make them guilty of rape!! So the next time you call Trump or Bill Clinton a rapist just remember the men who have had their lives ruined because of being falsely convicted of rape by the testimony of a liar!
21 | Marianne Hoenig Kopel | 17 | 1554780761208615_1554825454537479 | I am just watching your program this morning. Do you people actually even know that Hillary Clinton is a criminal and she should be locked up the news coverage on Hillary Clinton is ridiculous you act like nothing has happened
22 | Naomi Martinez | 9 | 1554780761208615_1554823527871005 | Hmm and Trump's court case is scheduled on December 16th for raping a 13 year old girl 🤔. No one takes these Trump supporters seriously 😂idiots
23 | Jeff Hobbs | 15 | 1554780761208615_1554794717873886 | To become a Federal agent with the FBI, they are at the top of their class in college. They are forensic scientists, scholars, PHD's, Lawyers, accountants...They know criminals when they've seen one. And as Americans, they've all taken THE oath to defend America by its enemies- foreign and domestic. They are taking a stand- not against Trump, but staging a coup against the Clinton corruption machine, with evidence, and standing behind their leader, Comey, and he's taking a stand with them. Who is with them? Are you? #ImWithTheFBI
24 | Teri Brounne | 14 | 1554780761208615_1554812534538771 | WOW!!! Some deplorables will do anything for attention and money! And you Don-the-Con are in the same class. Sickening to see such ugliness & lies the trump has made up for all the world to see :(
25 | Florence Vasilatos Zuder | 8 | 1554780761208615_902782486532100 | Alleged! And she's not! And trump has 2 rape allegations and many assult accusations! Not only has he probably done these and many fraud allegations...he's brainless!  Bill was a rhode scholar, did these consensual affairs, acts but our country was thriving. ... But he's not running for president. This very fit intelligent and talented women is! I'm with her!Trump will lose...Can't wait for him to get lost!!

1 | Christiana E Chimezie | 332 | 1554721017881256_1554726651214026 | Why do some weak minded people bring in politics in everything? These officers who just lost their lives have families, show them some respect. Nonsense!
2 | Jon Wilken | 239 | 1554721017881256_1554726494547375 | If we had appropriate background checks and appropriate gun control laws, these cops families wouldn't be planning funerals today. "Gun control" doesn't mean "take your guns away". It means keeping firearms out of the hands of CRIMINALS like the ones who just killed these two cops.
3 | Karen Baldwin | 96 | 1554721017881256_1554763731210318 | They will find the killers and lock them up immediately but when a black person is ambushed by the police on video the police take vacation with pay and people defend killing a innocent black person .. The truth is the truth 💯
4 | Kyle Martin | 94 | 1554721017881256_1554724544547570 | Catch em and Hang Em in a public venue but let the public Stone em before hand... bring back the old ways but that's just my opinion
5 | Brian O'Mara | 69 | 1554721017881256_1554730044547020 | I blame the Obama Administration for not helping to stop this years deadly Police killings!! We are losing more good Police Officers this year than ever before in our history...and Obama is nowhere to be found!!
6 | Mimi Brown | 51 | 1554721017881256_1554772794542745 | I can't wait for the election to be over so you all can stop this BS. They are dead because some idiot with a gun became unglued and decided to kill. Nothing to do with frickin politics... SMDH.
7 | Sandra Kellar | 64 | 1554721017881256_1554748957878462 | Its Obamas fault!!! Lol I swear what is wrong with u people??? I'm not a fan of his either. But I'm intelligent enough to know he didnt do it. Ok...so...white people here's a question. When cops were getting killed before Obama got in office, was it his fault then??? Just a question.
8 | Lisa Allen | 23 | 1554721017881256_1796871647250292 | They probably deserved it. They should've complied. The shooter probably feared for his life. What? This is what everyone says when a cop shoots an unarmed person but now when it's dead cops every sings a different tune. Just sayin.
9 | Georgia Butler McCallister | 37 | 1554721017881256_1554736604546364 | This is unimaginable, and has to stop! Prayers for the families and all those in blue that risk their lives to protect ours !!!

11 | Yvonne Medina | 10 | 1554721017881256_1554742467879111 | And when they do find them, take their rights away for life. If they ever need help 911 is just not available to them.RIP both officers
12 | Jamie Keller | 20 | 1554721017881256_1554759957877362 | Two officers were killed and people are bringing politics to the table?! Have some respect for these poor officers and their families,friends and loved ones. The election has nothing to do with this morning's events.
13 | Patricia Edison | 9 | 1554721017881256_1324994334177247 | Sow a seed, reap a harvest. They (the law enforcement community) have been murdering at with no repercussions. This was inevitable. Sympathies to the their families, but just as much sympathy to the families that have been destroyed by the police.
14 | Ronald Goff | 12 | 1554721017881256_1554734381213253 | It's become a sad state of affairs, and I've been concerned something like this was going to happen with the politics of hate and the televised abuse of power by some police.I hope it doesn't get out of hand. When they're organized against a specific threat. They can handle themselves.When they're on patrol on Tuesday night ... they're sitting ducks.
15 | Nicole Carter | 2 | 1554721017881256_1796985927238864 | The cops probably scared him. I mean they do have guns. That man feared for his life. Cops are dangerous you have to be prepared. Shoot first ask questions later. That's usually the narrative when it's a civilian. Ijs
16 | Grace Reyna Olivares Delgado | 8 | 1554721017881256_1554739397879418 | So sad and so tragic. I hope they find the scum that are responsible for this. And convict them worth the greatest extent of the law.  Prayers for the families.
17 | Justin Smith | 3 | 1554721017881256_1796908883913235 | This is what you get blowback from years of oppressive policing. When you make peaceful revolution impossible you make violent revolution inevitable. I shed no tears for these fallen lap dogs.
18 | Marcus Limbrick | 6 | 1554721017881256_1554762564543768 | Statistics show that is not #blacklivesmatter or refuges that are taking out these officers.  But I don't see this group stopped and frisk or closely monitored at their place of worship.
19 | Tonja L. Scott-Pate | 3 | 1554721017881256_1325050387504975 | I sure bet they wanted to point the finger at a black guy or group. But, the killer ain't black! Yet, I have heard, "immigrants, illegals and blacks are the problem." Hmmmm, you might want to rethink that. Most of the shootings of cops, killing and mass shootings are not from Muslims, immigrants, blacks or illegals. You see, it is the evil in one's heart that makes him/her bad, not their religion, race, or financial background. It is all a matter of the heart. Stop the ignorance and bias across America!
20 | William W. Cope | 4 | 1554721017881256_1554766474543377 | Hopefully they voted early for Trump so that their deaths are not in vain, "Crooked" Hillary "Stumblebum" Clinton will continue Brock O'Bama's legacy of allowing felons out of prison early
21 | Tracie Hawk | 9 | 1554721017881256_1554728164547208 | What is F-ing wrong with people!!! I hope to God, these same people or a member of their family, never "need" a cop one day!! Disgusting!
22 | Ame Rican | 8 | 1554721017881256_1554745267878831 | Black lives racists and the liberal democrats need to be held accountable for their anti police rhetoric that has caused these attacks on our officers!!!

24 | Martin Weston | 3 | 1554721017881256_1554781741208517 | There are more than 350 million guns in this country. As long as that is true, this tragedy will be repeated, again and again and again...I am so sorry, but we are being stupid.
25 | Nathan Newman | 1 | 1554721017881256_1796914320579358 | I wonder who he is voting for...Greene also posted a 10-second video featuring only a still photo showing him in the stands of the high school holding American and Confederate flags...Greene wrote, “I was offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem. Thousands more whites fought and died for their freedom. However this is not about the Armed forces, they are cop haters.﻿”

While Democrats' agitation is palpable, it's driven more by anger than panic at what they see as unprecedented and appalling meddling by outside forces in the election.

1 | Connie Condran | 554 | 1554526701234021_1554534107899947 | Are you kidding me? The mainstream media is on attack mode against Trump every single day and yet he keeps on. He is constantly rallying and packing the house. He is always having to defend himself against all the bogus allegations and the bias reporting. She is under FBI investigation, it's not a cake walk.

4 | Marlo See | 250 | 1554526701234021_1554529087900449 | By outside forces I am guessing that you mean the millions she has received from foreign governments. If Putin really wanted influence he would have just paid Hillary off like everyone else does.
5 | James Silberman | 159 | 1554526701234021_1554536871233004 | Outside forces? No one other than Hillary Clinton is hurting Hillary Clinton right now. If you're going to be thoroughly corrupt, you don't get to attack those who make known your corruption.

She is under investigation not once but twice by the FBI I can honestly say I don't know how anyone could vote for this crooked human being Vote trump all the way man
7 | Jill Daw Respass | 81 | 1554526701234021_1554551937898164 | NBC is nothing short of a Clinton news machine. This is the final nail in the old hags coffin. Now that Comey has finally gotten a backbone and realized that he needs to do his job perhaps now the real truth will finally be revealed. It's about time that all of the lies are misdirections stop. I for one never bought a single one of what she was trying to sell. She is a devious self serving deceitful poor excuse for a woman. The truth is always revealed. The lies never stand the test of time.

11 | Allen Flath III | 34 | 1554526701234021_1554580661228625 | If you don't want the FBI involved in the election: don't elect a candidate being investigated by the FBI.If you don't want people accusing you of rigging elections: don't elect a candidate that rigs elections.The only outside force the Democrats should be angry with, is the voices in their heads that compelled them to elect Hillary Clinton.
12 | Ro Spez | 31 | 1554526701234021_1554551684564856 | Trump will have no problem  with getting the 270 electoral votes, just media talk!

He has shamefully little knowledge of the issues facing the country and the world, and a temperament utterly unsuited to the job. He is a racist and a bully, a demagogue. He has proposed killing the families of terrorists, a violation of international law so blatant that a former CIA director predicted that U.S. troops would refuse to carry out such an order."http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ol-donald-trump-unsuited-to-be-president-20160302-story.html
17 | Steve Graham | 23 | 1554526701234021_1554564167896941 | NBC , you are missing the political story of the century. More corruption since Watergate . This goes deep into the Justice Department with the Attorney General even involved in obstruction of justice. Evidence being destroyed. And more . Yet you are actually covering it up too . Get back to objective journalism instead of shilling for Clinton .

20 | Dan Miller | 21 | 1554526701234021_1554536774566347 | NBC no it is not stable the Clinton Foundation is in Desperate mode at this point. There's some of her original EC states are going to switch to Trump and she will actually lose Electoral College votes and lose the Swing Vote States because of her latest corruption investigation
21 | Coulter Roe | 10 | 1554526701234021_1554570177896340 | To all Trump supporters out there, you can thank Hillary Clinton and Obama for the success of Operation Neptune Spear and the death of Bin Laden.
22 | Alan Brown | 4 | 1554526701234021_1944332512460953 | Outside meddling. That's rich. NBC News and other news agencies have done everything they could to help Hillary in this election. The bias in the media has never been more obvious than it has been in this election. NBC News as well as many other news agencies are nothing more than propaganda machines for the Democratic Party. Real journalism is dead. As far as the hacking is concerned, it's laughable the Democratic Party is complaining the Russians are trying to influence the election since the hacks have exposed the fact that the party itself has tried to influence the election in many unethical and illegal ways. If our so called journalists would do their jobs, we wouldn't have to find out these things from Wikileaks.
23 | Sallie McGuire | 10 | 1554526701234021_1944290885798449 | Thank you NBC! Voting Blue all the way up and down ballot! We need to rid our government of the Republican Obstructionists once and for all! We will make real progress in this nation the great USA!
24 | Daniel Gross | 8 | 1554526701234021_1554540277899330 | This entire election on both sides has been effected by outside influences.  Debbie Wasserman Schultz,  Vladimir Putin, James Comey, Paul Manafort,   Donna Brazile, and so on.

If he did any of these things all it takes is a congressman or President to present evidence and an investigation would be started. There is no criminal investigation...You in the media are scumbags. Why hasn't the president that hates Trump have him criminally investigated? There is no evidence.

1 | Clyde Barrow | 131 | 1554476141239077_1554485811238110 | Doesn't anybody understand that after you serve your time you shouldn't be penalized anymore you already lost you're freedom and everything else. Is this not the land of second chances and opportunities, nobody is perfect.
2 | Vanessa Cl | 126 | 1554476141239077_1554503297903028 | He is a product of this society, not the Korean society. This is ridiculous and even more upsetting when they put it like that. Bring the child over, ruin his life by putting him through a horrible childhood and then when he is just taking a turn and trying to be a father for his children, then let's ruin his life some more by removing him.... the system working at its finest... 😶
3 | Vicky Fitzmaurice | 90 | 1554476141239077_1554484487904909 | He was adopted by missionary types who basically abused and abandoned him, and screwed up on getting him naturalized . And there are thousands like him
4 | Jeannie N Sartin | 66 | 1554476141239077_1554506694569355 | America created him. He was adopted, mistreated, and then abandoned by Americans. His antisocial activities are a direct product of American influence. And now they want to return him to a country he doesn't know, where he doesn't even speak the language. It's such garbage! American born citizens commit these crimes every day, should we send them to a country they don't know and don't belong to because of it? It's basically the same thing. He might have been born in another country, but it is no more his home than it would be to someone born in the US.
5 | Ronald Goff | 25 | 1554476141239077_1554493447904013 | It sounds like he had more than his 2nd and 3rd chances. How many more should he get? He obviously hasn't changed his ways.Let's get rid of a problem before it gets worse.
6 | Shannon Malcom | 15 | 1554476141239077_1554511014568923 | His adoptive parents should be penalized, not him. It's not like he snuck over here, he was brought here as a child and understandably considers this his home. My heart breaks for him. These parents weren't for - that's not his fault or the fault of his children. Sickening.
7 | Kate Noonan | 14 | 1554476141239077_1554512067902151 | Yes, he has committed crimes. Crimes that he has been punished for. He has served his time. He was brought here at the age of 3, taken from the only country he knew at that time, and adopted. The adoptive parents didn't do what they were supposed to do,  which was get whatever documentation needed for him to become a citizen. So now, he has served his time and paid for his crimes, and he has created a beautiful family and (in my eyes) is an American. The fact that he is being deported to a country he knows NOTHING about is deplorable. My heart breaks for him and his wife, and their kids.
8 | Gina Lea Helwig | 35 | 1554476141239077_1554484044571620 | He's been here sinse he was 3....he's ours. He's an America.
9 | Carlos DeLeon | 34 | 1554476141239077_1554482371238454 | He's been here since he was 3 ? He's an American. Give him some US prison time instead.
10 | Thisaphone Sothhiphakhak | 2 | 1554476141239077_1554553481231343 | Same thing happened to me when I was 18 I was aiding abedding marijuana misdemeanor I was driving my friend had weed. I was in the work house for a,month. I got it expunged.  20 years later ice knocked on my door shackled me put me in detention for a month, I hunger strike for 14 days. they put me in solitary its not like in the movies you don't even get a toilet its a dungeon that they pump car exhaust from the garage you don't get a bed cold dirty floor. If a serial killer kept their victims pretty much the same. All you hear is,screams from others in the same situation going insane. you have to beg for water. I'm a metal head so this is what I listen to but living it now. I  got out due to pure resilience and 5k for a sleeze ball and  lawyer and 10k bond. After they let me out they gave me my belongings in a sealed plastic bag I tried to open it ice agent threatened to shoot me said no you can't open that til you get outside sign this I looked at the paper it stated i hear by signing have received all my belongings, I couldn't leave unless I signed it. Sure enough after being escorted outside the federal building by an armed guard, I opened the bag no ID. i had two more hearings but couldn't get into court without proper ID. so one year later still stuck. I came here as a child legally refuge my father fought secret the secret war in Laos for America. He died of Brain cancer before finishing his citizenship papers when I was 13. No easy answers.
11 | Kieran 'Kiwi' Bailey | 10 | 1554476141239077_1554529774567047 | I'm still surprised that citizenship isnt somehow part of the adoption deal. Considering how much paperwork goes in to the adoption process, you would think they'd include it in.
12 | Kate Steinberg | 14 | 1554476141239077_1554514151235276 | They found him because he was applying for a green card. So... if you want to become a citizen, and apply to do so legally, you'll get deported. (Keep in mind, yes he has a criminal history, but he's served his time + has untreated emotional trauma)
13 | Andrea Witkowski Uherka | 2 | 1554476141239077_1554489534571071 | This is sad but I know it happens as it did to my cousin adopted as an infant then deported after becoming a felon and being released from prison.
14 | Lukas Yoonshik Bong | 0 | 1554476141239077_1555053734514651 | To folks that believe Adam Crapser should be deported: Please do some research first. Adam is not a felon as he didnt commit any felony. The article below might help as well. He was abused, abandoned, and had to struggle to survive from the moment he was adopted.https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/us/adam-crapser-deportation-south-korea.amp.html
15 | Judy Cunha | 5 | 1554476141239077_1554519634568061 | Then we blame him for having issues. This, in my opinion, is his country. Right or wrong I think he's being abused and abandoned again. Something is so wrong with this. Cruel and unusual punishment.
16 | Sarah Kattau | 6 | 1554476141239077_1554512941235397 | NBC, what an idiotic lead. The story is that this man should be a citizen. Period. Yes, he has also committed crimes, but he should not be deported for it. That shouldn't even be an OPTION. He is American.
17 | Lalaine Lambo-Jolly | 0 | 1554476141239077_1554938251192866 | Mr. Crapser, don't worry. South Korea is actually a nice country. Lots of opportunities. Look on the bright side. You can establish your English as a second language business, for instance.
18 | Vanya Schoonover | 0 | 1554476141239077_1554882971198394 | Does the system try to punish the victim?Because he is the victim in this case:brought to this country against his will,abused,neglected as a child and now being punished for not turning right?This person needs help not deportation!
19 | Torrence Moss | 2 | 1554476141239077_1554644327888925 | He is not the poster boy for American citizenship. Yes, he was abandoned by his adopted parents. Yes, the foster care system  failed him, like so many others. But that is no reason, only an excuse and poor excuse for all the bad choices he chose. He chose not to take the path of citizenship. He chose to commit crimes. He was informed when filing for a green card the consequences of criminal activity.  He could have been deported years ago and yet he was allowed to stay. He abused the priviledge and now must pay the price.
20 | Michelle Mello | 0 | 1554476141239077_1554887147864643 | If he did his time after all of his crimes he should not be penalized being sent back to Korea he's brought here as a child and adopted let him become a citizen and if he continues to disobey the law then continue putting him in prison for breaking the law
21 | Tasha M. Wiggins | 0 | 1554476141239077_1554995357853822 | My problem with this story is: Americans adopted him didn't file citizenship paperwork then abandoned him to the state years later. He was a ward of the state for years and they also did not complete citizenship paperwork. Sounds like the error was doubly made on America. The solution is to send someone to a country he has not been in for over 20 years and doesn't know? That makes sense? We're not talking illegal immigrants. We're talking about people who went to another country and adopted a child and didn't fulfill their part of the contract.
22 | Willis M Parker | 0 | 1554476141239077_1554946247858733 | Did he break our laws? Is he here legally? He should be dealt with according to our laws Then he can start over and do it right.. We all have stories where we have been down and got no pity.
23 | Eric Ison | 0 | 1554476141239077_1554557841230907 | Can't really blame him, the powers that be made the US a third world and the average worker  just slightly above those they exploit globally. Do they think that buys them loyalty?
24 | Joe Bourguignon | 0 | 1554476141239077_1554864291200262 | Here we go again. At what age do you stop blaming your foster/adoptive parents and take responsibility for your self? Making sure you have the correct Immigration documents in-process or completed? If you do not have the Naturalization completed, you are not a citizen. If you did nothing, from the age of 21 (or 18, if you consider that the adult-age), then you share that burden of responsibility. You got caught! 'albeit almost 30 years later, but you got caught, and you are not legally authorized to remain. Time to go. IF the US CIS allows you to process your application for citizenship at this junction of time, you should be VERY grateful.
25 | Robbie Adams | 3 | 1554476141239077_1554514877901870 | I dont not feel sorry for him he done the crime he get what happen to him. Send him back we will still have to pay for him in jail. He will commit more crimes. Should have thought of that before he did the crime. The law is the law, if you are illegal then you need to go home period.

The coffee chain said the cups are meant as a reminder of unity, but others saw it as "liberal bias" and "political brainwashing."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sarah Elizabeth | 1960 | 1554429641243727_1554443964575628 | If being liberal means caring about the human race no matter what your color, being concerned for the well-being of others, and wanting to eliminate all of the hate in the world. Then I'm all in. ❤️
2 | Kelly Borders | 1663 | 1554429641243727_1554431861243505 | Conservatives don't like red cups or green cups?! Sounds like a conservative war on Christmas if you ask me!
3 | Alice Shieh | 1378 | 1554429641243727_1554439697909388 | I know Fall is coming when the PSL comes out, and I know Christmas is coming when conservative groups threaten to boycott Starbucks over whatever the hell is on the new holiday cup. Pretty much tradition at this point.
4 | Daniel Gonzalez | 672 | 1554429641243727_1554435364576488 | Omg Starbucks is trying to erase Christmas again with this unity crap! <insert eye roll here> Why... I think I'm going to start saying my name is Merry Christmas so when they call out the name they HAVE to say Merry Christmas! <insert another eye roll and  sarcasm here>
5 | Michael J. Piper | 522 | 1554429641243727_1554446734575351 | But Chick-fil-A and Hobby Lobby are applauded by the Right for taking a stand on their beliefs. And how is it that "unity in diversity" is even a partisan/political issue?How do you spell hypocrisy?
6 | Susan Hendricks | 381 | 1554429641243727_1554442391242452 | If you don't like the cup and what it stands for, don't drink the coffee....Starbucks won't be going out of business over it. Christmas is coming soon and people will have "Christmas cups" to complain over. Get a life, people.
7 | Katrina Grant Georgiana | 311 | 1554429641243727_1554440861242605 | So this is Starbucks Christmas cup controversy for this year. Hmm, last year people were pissed  😡 off because it was a simple red. Personally I think some people are just a bunch of 'pissed' looking for a place to land...
8 | Hannah Howard | 211 | 1554429641243727_1554441547909203 | Yea unity, how un-Christian of them. Jesus never spoke of the people and finding common ground with strangers and caring for each othe... oh wait.
9 | Tori D'Ambrosio | 233 | 1554429641243727_1554432024576822 | It's a cup for God sakes!! Leave it, if it offends some people, they have way to much time on their tiny itty bitty hands, and pea brains!
10 | Andrew Dirks | 116 | 1554429641243727_1554450451241646 | Yeah, heaven forbid Christians actually emulate the teachings of Christ and love thy neighbor... that would just be liberal bias and brainwashing!
11 | Shannon Malcom | 78 | 1554429641243727_1554443791242312 | It's ... a cup. With people drawn on it. It contains lovely coffee. I fail to see how any of that is bad or boycott-worthy, but whatever. By all means, if someone wants to get worked up over a cup of coffee, fine by me.
12 | Nikki Angela Williams | 67 | 1554429641243727_1831581673793449 | My first thought was, "what a beautiful idea." I'm not sure how this could possibly be offensive. Isn't a hallmark of the holiday season the hope for "peace and good will towards men" ...or did I miss something?
13 | Lucy Fuchs Brill Venz | 47 | 1554429641243727_1554451697908188 | What does a paper coffee cup have to do with Christmas? These are the same people who go on a rampage for bargains on Black Thursday or Black Friday. What does shopping have to do with the real meaning of Christmas? The same people who say Christ is the reason for the season, who are offended by those who say happy holidays instead of merry Christmas, and claim there is a war on Christmas. Just go worship in your churches and homes and leave the public sector out of it!
14 | Michael Bromery | 59 | 1554429641243727_1554437057909652 | People need to dump all the hate. We definitely need more of this. Political brainwashing is exactly what got so many in this country to hate, in the first place. I would say, that comment against this cup is made with 100% irony.
15 | Susan Stover Lehman | 62 | 1554429641243727_1554441387909219 | Oh good grief...last year complainers moaned about the red cup. Take your own cup to Starbucks and stop being offended by everything!
16 | Kaelen Marie | 54 | 1554429641243727_1554432567910101 | What's the word for the phenomenon of a few crazy people making a stink about something and then the something becomes trending because a million people overreact to the crazy people?
17 | Nickey Will | 54 | 1554429641243727_1554441527909205 | Wait...so people are upset that they want to promote unity?? Should that not be the basis of any political talking point...or is the goal racial/socioeconomic divide?? Please elaborate🤔😟😒
18 | Pauline G. Rhoades | 34 | 1554429641243727_1554452941241397 | Just drink the dang coffee! So tired of all this analyzing and crap! If you don't like the dang cup....don't buy Starbucks. Can it be any simpler? Focus on all the real problems. And maybe the media should take a very long vacation! Ugh.
19 | Christine Pettefer | 29 | 1554429641243727_1554445827908775 | Okay who are these people? Seriously cause most people I know couldn't give a care about any of this so who are they? Or is this just free advertising for Starbucks? Reporter getting free coffee for a month with every story smh
20 | Teresa Addison Smith | 22 | 1554429641243727_1831598543791762 | Trump,  "Maybe we should boycott Starbucks, I don't know." What a typical comment from him and what a divisive leader. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to drink from this unity cup.  Well done, Shogo Ota it is beautiful.  I thank you for your inspirational work.
21 | Lauren S. Kahn | 26 | 1554429641243727_1554445861242105 | The same idiots who objected to last year's cup because it did not say "Merry Christmas"--forgetting that Starbucks is in places where there are very few Christians. If you want to boycott the cup, boycott the cup and shut up.
22 | Nikole Darnell | 26 | 1554429641243727_1554439211242770 | Oh, I didn't realize that promoting unity was a bad thing. :I Yes, let's all continue to hate each other. That's a much better idea.
23 | Deanna Gonzales | 14 | 1554429641243727_1831581063793510 | I'm very confused 😕 As a Christian, Republican Trump supporter....I'm not exactly sure what is offensive about this cup? 😕 I mean, its not the prettiest cup, but not really sure what's offensive about it. But I don't care what's on my Starbucks cup...I'm still guna drink my white chocolate mocha out of it!! 😂😂
24 | Megan Curtis Galovich | 9 | 1554429641243727_1785673351713195 | I am going to say again as I said last year with the whole Red Cup thing. This is not really a controversy except in the minds of the media. Please don't get all ridiculously angry over people not really being angry over the cup. There is nothing to see here. Move along
25 | Michael Askins | 13 | 1554429641243727_1554451207908237 | Anyone who is upset by, angry about or sad about this cup is a moron. Move on and worry about actual, important things happening in your diversity-hating, possibly racist life instead. The world thanks you.

Chuck Todd examines the post-FBI revelation electoral map projections to see how Hillary Clinton or Donald J. Trump could win the presidency.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jody Michael Sanchez | 262 | 10154760890203689_10154761236323689 | On the Lawrence O'Donnell News they say 53% of Florida voters have cast their ballots. From those early voters Hillary Clinton leads with 48% of the vote, to Mr. Trumps 40%. If Hillary wins Florida there is no way for Donald Trump to win. HOORAY! WE CAME THROUGH.....You have an early outlook for the things to come. 28% of Republicans voted for Hillary Clinton.
2 | Rin Kate Watt | 121 | 10154760890203689_10154761264583689 | I'll vote for Clinton, rather than the man accused of raping and assaulting more than a dozen women, the man who defrauded thousands of students, who underpaid hundreds of contractors, who used charity funds to bribe attorneys general, who wants to abolish abortion and same-sex marriage, who uses racism and Islamophobia to rile his base.
3 | Daniel Polinsky | 92 | 10154760890203689_10154761240458689 | Don't believe their new narrative. The main stream media is trying to make you believe Trump cant win since he cant get the electoral votes. This isn't true and don't believe it for a minute. They are trying to discourage Trump voters from voting. Don't fall for it!!!
4 | Jeff Cook | 67 | 10154760890203689_10154761243393689 | Hillary Clinton once said someone who was under FBI investigation shouldn't NOT be allowed to buy a gun. That's very true!!!Now someone who is also back under FBI investigation should not be allowed to run for President of the United States either. Especially having access to the most powerful weapons on Earth nuclear warheads.
5 | Damien Olmeda | 41 | 10154760890203689_10154761243948689 | Will we be hearing more about Donald's alleged rape of a 13yr old girl which is heading to court in December or are we just going to pretend he's a sexual predator with adult women only? Here's a copy of the court documents. http://lawnewz.com/high-profile/federal-judge-orders-hearing-in-donald-trump-rape-lawsuit-case/
6 | Steve Lovesee | 27 | 10154760890203689_10154761259208689 | Trump will likely win more states like New York, Florida,  North Carolina and others.Driving through these states they are loaded with Pro Trump signs.Donald Trump will be the next President.
7 | Sheila Elliott | 15 | 10154760890203689_10154761453633689 | Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months, I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.Today I find my hope in those who will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken,you will NEVER Get My Vote!

He's already taken advantage of a burnt out ruin to build his Golden House, cheering for the housing collapse and profiting off the misery and the financial devastation of others. Plastering his name on towers and casinos, he purchased a  "Colossus" portrait of himself using $20,000 from charity. He knows more about theater than governance. He has even approached others to do all the work for him. Everyday he undermines our democracy. Thin skinned he rails against the press and free speech. He lauds autocrats, and they, who would love nothing more than to see this country weakened in turn support him. His commentary on women is repulsive. And he remains unapologetic and incapable of seriousness in a nation where one in four of our daughters will be victims of assault. He brags about his resorts in Dubai built with actual slave labor. His products are made in sweatshops. He brags about not honoring contracts here. His signature proposal is his scapegoating of immigrants, hispanics and other religions. This Nero, whose name is synonymous with 666, how can a patriot vote America into his hands?

25 | Paul Henry Williams | 0 | 10154760890203689_10154762037373689 | Well with the FBI also dredging up files on Bill Clinton all that will do is show those with a brain that the FBI who's being pushed by Trump is on a witch hunt for Hillary late in the campaign. I don't know about others but I will speak for myself Hillary is innocent otherwise they would have indited her back in August. However they opened up the pardon that Bill Clinton got back in '05 which is the dumbest thing I think I've ever heard of. He's not running for Presidency and yet here you have a leader of the GOP who is Director for the FBI doing things that don't only seem unlawful (see the term Double Jeopardy for those of you who are GOP and have been so held back in education and laziness). I mean you do realize that this will push voters toward Hillary right? Clearly she isn't apart of the "Almighty Big Government" that all the southerners and GOP members fear but rather obviously is hated by them.

Is it education or humiliation?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Rebecca Peck | 434 | 1554403254579699_1554406061246085 | Both, and rightly so. Seeing yourself through the eyes of others can be a very powerful catalyst for change.
2 | Aina Winston | 211 | 1554403254579699_1554410471245644 | It must be nice to not have a whole drug epidemic attributed to your race. When it was crack we needed "law and order". When its heroin we need a "rehab instead of arrest" program.
3 | Melissa Woodard | 143 | 1554403254579699_1554420114578013 | Why should anyone be concerned about how she, the mother and her mother, feel?What about the child in the backseat?  What about the potential danger she could have caused if she was able to drive after shooting up?  An addict is still an addict. It may be a disease, but it isn't an excuse to place innocent people in harms way or expose them to things that they shouldn't have been exposed to.  If she or her family didn't want her heroin overdose picture exposed, she shouldn't have exposed that child to it.  If she is ashamed, it is because she should be.  I have compassion for the child, but not the addict. Or any addict that sacrifices relationships of any kind for their "disease" or choices.
4 | Timothy Wood | 71 | 1554403254579699_1554435284576496 | She did it in a public place. Anyone could have taken a picture, she gave up her right to privacy. No sympathy in regards to that. Hopefully she gets her priorities straight and gets help.
5 | Melanie Rebecca | 69 | 1554403254579699_1554424931244198 | Whatever your stance is on addiction, this is a horrible invasion of privacy. A public servant- the LEO that responded to this scene and had a hand in saving this young woman's life- took a photo of her without her consent and it went viral. Ugh. No other social services worker could get away with doing this without serious legal consequences.
6 | Kathy Dallos Oyler | 34 | 1554403254579699_1554411754578849 | It is educational but at the same time people need to be responsible for their words.   The local NBC station shared a story about a young woman who ended up with a pacemaker after an overdose.   The young woman wanted to educate people on what could happen.   The folks on the internet crucified her and her family.     I wish people would not say anything on the internet that they would not say to someone's face.   So, maybe the news media should consider running some segments on how harmful mean comments from strangers are to those who are suffering or trying to share a story.     I have also seen incredibly unkind comments on murder/suicide stories.     People blame the family for not knowing instead of understanding that someday it could happen to them - I don't think families know and if they do -- can they do anything if they are afraid/concerned of the person their loved one is with? That might be a good segment too.     Imagine how much better the world would be if everyone offered support to those in difficult situations instead of criticizing them.   How much faster could a person/family recover if those who are unable to offer kind words just kept their thoughts to themselves?   Unfortunately the news media does this as well.   Matt Lauer comes to mind and Savanah Guthrie said some very unkind comments on the air about a couple whose children spent every weekend with their grandparents.   So maybe, the media needs to be a little more responsible too.
7 | Jessica Guetter | 21 | 1554403254579699_1554427277910630 | I am recovering from alcoholism, compulsive gambling, and smoking cigarettes... it is possible to live a normal and healthy life! I hope she gets the help she needs and is successful with recovery!!!
8 | Annmarie Spinetti | 52 | 1554403254579699_1554405354579489 | It's humiliation and shaming some like this could further ruin their life and not help them.
9 | Holly Eyer Weakland | 16 | 1554403254579699_1554413241245367 | Both. But sometimes you need humiliation to realize what you are doing to yourself and family and especially your child. I have some sympathy for drug addicts depending on their situation. However I have no sympathy for drug addicts that do drugs around their children or put their children in danger. If you have to do drugs at least take your children to someone where they will be safe while you do your thing
10 | Bob Scott | 22 | 1554403254579699_1554411534578871 | To think that this is a personal private matter is absolutely idiotic, this is a epidemic of personal choice with little consequence for the chooser. it not a disease, these users need to be in the spotlight not anonymously coddled away...
11 | Kari Mellon | 25 | 1554403254579699_1554411184578906 | Don't want to be seen in the eyes of the public..... stay home and shoot your heroin there, then when you OD your body can rot while your baby spends days trying to wake you up....... get sober.
12 | Kathleen McNally | 13 | 1554403254579699_1554411104578914 | My local paper just ran an obit of a 19 year old girl that died of heroin overdose. Parents asked it be in the obituary and it is on the death certificate. They wanted people to know its everywhere. Save lives, get the word out, drugs are bad.
13 | Danielle Prinzi | 7 | 1554403254579699_1554824814537543 | You shot your heroin in a car while your baby was in the backseat. You think we have any sympathy towards you? I'm sure she'll try and sue the police department or the police officer, win a bunch of money and buy more heroin. Our world is insane. I can't even wrap my head around it.
14 | Shelli Sellers | 10 | 1554403254579699_1554425754577449 | She humiliated herself and endangered her child. She deserves any and all feedback she gets but I will bet you she didn't learn a thing and will be using as soon as she gets out of jail!
15 | Naomi Watkins | 8 | 1554403254579699_1554623514557673 | Drug users don't think the same way non-users do. Shame nor guilt is a determining factor in getting their next high. Unless you are knowledgeable about a subject your input isn't helpful or relevant. It's purely opinion. The only ones affected by these pics are family and friends and they have NO control over an addict...
16 | Sabrina Corcoran | 11 | 1554403254579699_1554414761245215 | I understand why he wanted to share this. Drug addiction is a huge problem, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where addiction to pain pills is big. However, this was a private struggle between her and her family and didn't need to be exploited to the world. If people think snapping pictures of drug addicted people and putting it on social media or to newspaper outlets is going to help people with addiction, you are wrong. Only treatment, both psychological and physical, is the best solution. But the problem is how do we get the treatment facilities in order to do what needs to be done?
17 | Linda Madsen | 4 | 1554403254579699_1554466844573340 | Educational to whom?  Some troglodyte hasn't realized that shooting up drugs isn't glamorous and may kill you? Public shaming hasn't ever been an effective treatment measure or a deterrent to crime. Why do you think the stocks were eliminated? As it was, the picture was posted on the internet before the young woman hadn't even gone to trial. It should never have been posted to a public media outlet.
18 | Monique Garcia Santiago | 2 | 1554403254579699_1554585304561494 | I could really care less about how humiliated she feels, she put her child in danger- let's focus on the real problem here. I think if more photos are being spread then maybe they will think twice about doing such stupid, life threatening things....especially when they involve innocent children! Suppose she passed out at the wheel and killed not only her child but an entire family in another vehicle?! #sorrynotsorry
19 | Kimberly Sherry | 5 | 1554403254579699_1554423627910995 | Let's put it this way...I got in more trouble for my dog scratching (seriously, it was a scratch not a bite and it was accidental) a neighbor kid than the individuals who were at the same arraignment hearing did...and they were driving and had paraphernalia in the car with them!  That's the law folks!  You get a smack on the wrist for endangering lives, but God forbid your dog scratches someone.  Sorry, but something is seriously wrong with our legal system!!  Maybe my dog could go to behavior management/rehab and I would have my 4th degree misdemeanor expunged??
20 | Cindi Remy | 1 | 1554403254579699_1554845447868813 | I'm not sure why we feel it's ok to publicly shame addicts. I understand and praise the intent but the fall out makes their attempt at sobriety so much harder. The impact on the family who is already struggling is horrible, and the kid ya'll are hoping to protect is now marked as the child of an addict. Are we going to state publicizing graphic pictures of shooting victims to speak out against gun violence? No way. These people need help not shame. These pictures also can destroy families who have lost loved ones to addiction. We've seen it, we've tried and to see something like this blasted on social media makes you sick. If you all think a picture is going to get an addict to stop shooting up you obviously don't understand addiction
21 | Kaelin Eileen | 4 | 1554403254579699_1554449097908448 | The cop did the right thing. All criminal records for adults are open to the public. Picture or not, this arrest will follow her around for employment, etc. If she wants to endanger her own life, so be it. But the life of a baby? Nope. She should be sterilized and the baby placed with a family who truly deserves the opportunity to be good parents
22 | Lori Ginter | 4 | 1554403254579699_1554430111243680 | I understand the need for privacy but I have friends who are EMT's and they are finding that a lot of young people aren't worried about overdosing because of Narcan and maybe seeing what an overdose really looks like will help them. I don't believe this is the case in this case but maybe she can help someone else out there. I hope she gets the help she needs and lives a long happy life with her son.
23 | Ralph Benson | 3 | 1554403254579699_1554547831231908 | I think this is terrible. Sure the idea sounds good because it could help others, but I think it was a total invasion of her privacy. The picture will forever be on the internet and while she was identified with the paraphernalia she is still innocent until she goes to court. Normally I would not say this but I hope she sues the police department.
24 | Martine Boulanger | 1 | 1554403254579699_1554979907855367 | How dare people to wish for others to die!!! Shame on you! You do not want to see your own family member die either nor would you want your loved ones to be treated with threats either. Shame on you to say these horrible things!!!
25 | Sandy Stevenson Wloszek | 3 | 1554403254579699_1554462527907105 | I'm not sorry for being so angry at this women who put her child at such a risk!!!  My family has seen first hand the damage that drugs & alcohol does to families, especially to the children!!!  I have to say a big "Thank you" to the officer who posted this picture!!!  Right or wrong in anyone else's eyes, if it saves even one child, then he did the right thing!!!

The Trump campaign has argued that the moves reflect their confidence that recent news of further FBI inquiry into emails by Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin has set the stage for a breakthrough.

16 | David Hughes | 3 | 1554343137919044_1554379831248708 | On January 20, 2001, hours before leaving office, U.S. President Bill Clinton granted Rich a highly controversial presidential pardon. Several of Clinton's strongest supporters distanced themselves from the decision.[23] Former President Jimmy Carter, a fellow Democrat, said, "I don't think there is any doubt that some of the factors in his pardon were attributable to his large gifts. In my opinion, that was disgraceful."[24] Clinton himself later expressed regret for issuing the pardon, saying that "it wasn't worth the damage to my reputation."[9]Clinton's critics alleged that Rich's pardon had been bought, as Denise Rich had given more than $1 million[25] to Clinton's political party (the Democratic Party), including more than $100,000 to the Senate campaign of the president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and $450,000 to the Clinton Library foundation during Clinton's time in office.[

18 | Sheila Elliott | 5 | 1554343137919044_1554500407903317 | Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months, I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.Today I find my hope in those who will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken,you will NEVER Get My Vote!

4 | Mercedes Amelia MC | 234 | 1554320674587957_1554329707920387 | Anyone who equates Hillary Clinton’s “issues” with Donald Trump’s Corruption has no idea of the facts. Consider, for example, Trump’s illegal contribution to Florida’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, after she received multiple complaints from Florida students that they were cheated by Trump University. Once she received a $25,000 donation from Trump, her office dropped the inquiry.Or Trump’s solicitation of campaign funds from foreign officials, in clear violation of federal campaign laws.Or Trump’s refusals to pay contractors who have done work for him, many of them small businesses.Or Trump University’s repeated scams.Or the Trump Network, a pyramid scheme in violation of federal securities regulations.Or Trump Model Management, which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U.S. illegally.Or Trump’s employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts, claiming he couldn’t find Americans to do the work.Or Trump’s history of being charged with housing discrimination.Or Trump’s illegal dealings with Cuba while it was under embargo.Or Trump Foundation operating illegally.The list goes on. Donald Trump has a proven record of corruption. Hillary Clinton does not. Anyone who equates the two hasn't been paying attention.It would be nice to have an FBI investigation into these facts on Trump.(Jere). I agree! with Jere and I don't understand why Trump's errors and corruption are constantly ignored and this man laughs all including the FBI that instead of doing their job, create intrigue to favor Republicans.

How about reporting the truth. How about what happen today as in Emails show where hillary Clinton emailed huma about break8ng Bernie's legs. How about that Michelle oboma has now deleted anything regarding hillary Clinton as she has had enough. How about people understanding that the new email investigation has nothing to do with the last investigation. As they were investigating weiner they came across thousands of emails that Hillary had emailed. Security risk. They are checking into m9ney laundering and sex scandal on children. Wake up people this woman is a disgrace

Can NBC News seriously compare that to the Clinton foundation misappropriating 10s of millions of dollars meant to help Haiti. Or accepting millions of donations to get government contracts while she was Secretary of State. Or accepting millions of dollars from countries that kill homosexuals, stone women who have been raped, and deny basics liberties to women?  The whole time campaigning that she is for women's rights. Bye the way, women at the Clinton foundation are paid much less than men in the same positions. Just saying.

What matters is the DID, and it should matter to everyone that Trump misused charity money. It should upset everyone if it was a nickel or 10K. What is really telling about trump's mentality is what he misused the money on, come one. A portrait of himself??? Who does that??? Talk about self centered and self absorbed.

Demagogues violate established rules of political conduct; most who were elected to high office changed their democracy into some form of dictatorship.Demagogues appealed directly to the emotions of the poor and uninformed, pursuing power, telling lies to stir up hysteria, exploiting crises to intensify popular support for their calls to action.

14 | Holly Nothdurft Sparks | 76 | 1554287287924629_1554308274589197 | Trump seems oddly subdued this week. Somebody must be putting something in his drinks. Kinda like all the sniffin at the debates. What happens if he is elected and found guilty of raping the 13 year old child? Then the potus is a pedofile. I am sure his supporters would be ok with that since they think he does no wrong. It would probably be obamas fault or maybe hillarys, because he does no wrong. He makes me want to vomit
15 | Gailyn Ellis Thrower | 87 | 1554287287924629_1554317774588247 | I wouldn't vote Trump if he was a democrat! I wouldn't vote Trump whatever ticket he is on ! No Trump now no Trump ever! As for me and my house we will never vote Trump!

18 | Celia Black | 72 | 1554287287924629_1554301211256570 | Those who want to change their votes, please do so. One cannot vote for a criminal under investigation and have her become President.
19 | Ena Riden | 39 | 1554287287924629_1219240578129605 | Bye bye stubborn Donal Bump, #imwithher you have no qualification to compare with her. Vote for you will be most insulting ever. If you were the last person on earth, I would vote my dog instead of you. My dog is nice and educated, not like you.
20 | Susan Eliasoff Fields | 52 | 1554287287924629_1554312727922085 | Never ever ever! You are a disgrace to this country. You are a racist, anti semitic, hate spewing misogynistic incompetent being. I'm one nasty woman and I vote. But not for you.
21 | Walter G. Kloepfer | 61 | 1554287287924629_1554306674589357 | Nothing has changed over the past few days...haven't seen anything in those emails that would change my vote, er, haven't seen the emails yet. You want us to change our minds because of nothing, sorry Democrats aren't stupid.
22 | Marc Streem | 56 | 1554287287924629_1554305321256159 | The Republicans have put the FIX in! We ALL must get out and VOTE BLUE TO SAVE OUR GREAT COUNTRY FROM THE ULTIMATE CONMAN TRUMP who ONLY cares about Trump! Trump will destroy our great country just like he did with many of his businesses and the thousands of people he hurt in doing so! Trump only cares about Trump!
23 | Janet Mingo | 33 | 1554287287924629_660508847442475 | To all the haters.... read this....I asked a young Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”.Here is her answer:Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think. Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist. Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race. Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist. Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right. Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country. Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe? Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers. Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life. Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them. Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it. Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries. Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot. Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success. And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.
24 | Larry Ramos | 40 | 1554287287924629_1219270464793283 | I am an independent, but after close examination of your bulling tactics I have decided to vote for democracy. My vote went for Hillary. I'm with her. Democracy vs. demagogue
25 | Zabi Habash | 43 | 1554287287924629_1554304117922946 | America is imploding, You Republicans scare the bejesus out of most of the world. We still remember George W Bush! And he's looking good compared to Trump!Trump has managed to bring out people hidden in the woods.

3 | Cliff Rice | 29 | 1554276451259046_1554285317924826 | This is private land that the protesters are trespassing on. The vast majority of land is either owned by the company after purchasing it from locals, or they purchased easement rights from the owners. Only 1% of the pipeline is on public land. The parent company of Dakota Access is a Texas company, not a foreign company, . The pipeline company has rerouted the pipeline 140 times in North Dakota alone to avoid sensitive sites when tribes worked with them to identify culturally sensitive areas that had not been identified by previous surveys. The Standing Rock tribe made little effort to work with either the pipeline company or the Army Corp to identify sensitive areas so that they could work around them. The area around the lake where this is being built is mostly running parallel with a previous gas line and power line as much as possible to minimize disturbing new ground. The tribe failed to provide any documentation that where the pipeline was being built, had any sacred rock rock piles or other culturally sensitive artifacts. Pipelines cross about 35,000 rivers, streams and lakes in the US, and there are 8 pipelines that already cross the Missouri River. This pipeline also crosses the James, Big Sioux, Des Moines, Mississippi, and Illinois Rivers. It's a sad time in America when the rule of law no longer applies.

6 | Sheila Elliott | 4 | 1554276451259046_1554502037903154 | Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months, I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.Today I find my hope in those who will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken,you will NEVER Get My Vote!
7 | Jennifer Smith | 4 | 1554276451259046_1554411741245517 | For goodness shakes, Hillary doesn't know what she is doing!...Her accused RAPIST husband Bill Clinton would have to guide her!  However Trump is going to win the election so we won't have to worry about Hillary screwing it up!
8 | Eric Fulford | 2 | 1554276451259046_1554492034570821 | Both parties need to tell their idiot fringe to go back under their respective rocks. This republic was founded and maintained by compromise and you cannot do that until you move back to the center.
9 | Greg Frith | 1 | 1554276451259046_1554493117904046 | Just in case anyone has forgotten, international tax fugitive Marc Rich bought a highly controversial Presidential Pardon from Bill Clinton in 2001 via a $1,000,000+ donation to the Clinton Foundation  from his ex-wife, Denise Rich, to help pay for the Clinton Presidential library. It seems the FBI has finally released a lot of information into the investigation they conducted into Bill Clinton's "Pardon For Payment" allegations in 2001. Trump is not much better, but this is who you are voting to get into the White House if you vote for Hillary Clinton - An established political dynasty willing to sell out political favours for cash. Abraham Lincoln would be spinning in his grave. How has it come to this?
10 | Jeanne Clevenger | 6 | 1554276451259046_1554309911255700 | Hillary has nobody to blame but herself for installing a private server in her home. Why did Huma not disclose the emails when she was interviewed by the FBI? Weiner has now been given the opportunity to reduce his sentence by cooperation or sell out America's security to other nations...there is no telling what he has done. Hillary's fault 100%. Research Shahram Amiri so you can see what the possible consequences can be because of her "criminal gross negligence".

12 | Jackie Rawlings | 2 | 1554276451259046_1554300827923275 | well as long as Americans don't know the job of the three branches of Government and keep electing the same State Senators and Congress who work for the pipeline companies will the corporations win.

13 | Martha Mayer | 0 | 1554276451259046_1554955127857845 | If you don't want the truth about Hillary don't read it. A Lie Named Hillary .. I oppose her because she cannot tell the truth to save her life. Any public servant who has the gall to issue a list of terms the press cannot utter, as if disposing the corpse of free will, is helplessly deluded and a petulant child. Sorry, Hillary, but no one owes you anything; especially the nation you proclaim to serve with nothing but the benevolence of blind ambition. If your candidacy cannot survive without the aid of deception, division, and the fabricated catcalls of “sexism” to demonize your critics, then please tell us why America needs you? Better yet, please explain how you’re even worthy of the job? A leader doesn’t need pollsters, a panel of advisers, two news conferences and a room full of media drones just to announce whether or not she used an unauthorized server to conduct official government business and therefore deleted emails in an attempt to avoid prosecution. A leader would never break the law in the first place. And a leader doesn't shout, "At this point, what difference does it make" when four lives are lost in the wake of her unmitigated failure. Any self-respecting adult with an ounce of integrity would simply admit the truth. Excuse me, any self-aware child who knows the difference between right and wrong, life and death. She was thrown off the Congressional Watergate panel for lying and she hasn't stopped lying since !!!!!. And some people want her as our President - she can't  & won't even tell the Truth as Secretary of State - and remember all she has done there to pad her financial pockets and political career - That should never have begun.If I’m hiring someone to run my business, placing my future in foreign hands, I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican, a man or woman, white or black. I want the most qualified candidate whose character speaks for itself and whose ideals can stand on the merits of their own wisdom. That’s common sense. Are you going to have the audacity to tell me what I can and can’t ask; what verbiage is acceptable? If your resume and vision are truly best for the entire nation, not just one party, gender or race, either should be able to withstand the most blistering questions and exhaustive scrutiny. In fact, you should welcome any and all discourse to discredit your detractors and display your competence. A leader unites, empowers and inspires by example, not by excuses or endless blame. Tell me the national debt is a record 19 Trillion and that Barack Obama has raised it more than the first 43 presidents combined. Admit that an estimated 94 million Americans are out of the workforce, nearly 50 million are on public assistance, and that the economic recovery is a sham. Admonish Iran as a destabilizing force of Islamic radicalism that must never be mentioned in the same sentence as “nuclear power". Recognize the reality every civilized nation has immigration laws and that American sovereignty, the safety and security of her people, supersedes any political ploy to stuff the ballot box beneath the hollow cries of racism.Yes, just like generations of legal immigrants before your candidacy, respect is given when trust is earned. If you are incapable of acknowledging simple, documented facts - solely because it’s easier to hide behind a propaganda platform that cajoles and incites an expendable public - you're not interested in solving anything, let alone serving the American people or any notion of truth. You and the likes of you are the cancer killing the country I love. You’re the lie my forefathers warned us about. Hillary Clinton has a long and inglorious history of alleged document tampering and questionable legal maneuverings.. AMERICAN VOTERS WE NEED TO KEEP HER OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.. SHE BELONGS IN JAIL - PLEASE - PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE !!!

22 | Adam Wise | 2 | 1554276451259046_1554399371246754 | I can't believe that so many people have been swindled by this pipeline protest. As if it has anything to do with the environment. It's about money people. The tribe wanted too much money for the rights to lay the pipeline through reservation land, so the pipeline company went around them. Now they're protesting it crossing north of the reservation to try and force the pipeline to go through their land and cross the river further south. Then of course they'll get paid. It's just about greed.

24 | Chad Hance | 3 | 1554276451259046_1554288461257845 | LOL! Hillary has a lot more to worry about. This subject won't matter to her. She'll be getting drunk watching President Trump on the news.

He needs to do two things right now, sign an order that denies the contractor the right to install the pipeline on public proporty and stop the state from using the National Guard as a police force for private corporate use. But Obama won't do these things because he works for the oligarchs who are the ones this pipeline progect belongs to! Can you say Obama is a currupt tool of the oligarchs that control him, the military, and the government.

The Kremlin is backing a plan to rid government offices and state-controlled companies of all foreign software, starting with Moscow city government replacing Microsoft products with Russian ones.

1 | Paul de Serres | 147 | 1554254251261266_1554264354593589 | I'm confident Bill Gates is going to have trouble sleeping at night, knowing that he's lost business from this country's arch-rival. Even if Russia could divest themselves from any future Microsoft product purchases, as the article stated, too much of their IT infrastructure is based on Microsoft products. Good luck with that strategy, Putin – now you won't have any Microsoft support, either.
2 | Daniel Ayers | 143 | 1554254251261266_1554259267927431 | I'm sick of Russia. Bill Gates could buy Russia. Microsoft should attack Putin

4 | Jim Williams | 38 | 1554254251261266_1554278784592146 | Breaking News!!!: "FBI discovers shocking revelations in Hillary's e-mails. Her e-mails reveal that Clinton cheated on three spouses and pleaded the fifth 97 times to avoid admitting she committed adultery, molested fourteen men, ripped off hundreds of workers and contractors and investors, defrauded hundreds of students, mocked a handicapped reporter, lost a billion on a casino in 1995 when the economy was booming, has actually never released any of her tax returns so we can know who she owes money to, is going to court for fraud and raping a 13 year old boy, and used the money from her foundation to line her own pockets and bribe two attorneys general, and she has a former Putin assistant as co-chair of her campaign, is receiving millions of dark money from Russian oligarchs, Russians hacking into RNC and Trump campaign e-mails," I'm sticking with Hillary.

Yes, our government is still on that broken record about Russia being the big bad evil empire. At one time, during WWII Russia was our ally. Do everyone a favor and take a step back and look at the big picture. How many countries have we, the USA, invaded or gone to war with over the past 50 years? Seriously, how many? Now how many has Russia acted against? Here's a news flash. The Russian People are just as peacefull as we, the American public are. Our government is using wars to keep our nation in turmoil. What do our current wars have to do with our national security? Fight terrorists we created.

Typically Google would have given 60 days for them to fix the issue, but in this instance they only gave them 10 days because systems were already being compromised. Now Russia wants to back away from Microscoft. What is the connection?

Copyright protection being pushed by Microsoft made Putin rip illegal copies that many schools where using, he never liked that, it made him look bad.  China ripped it out of many stories, but had a free specially designed version of linux to replace in schools and government, may having been using wine for compatibility.

But it may not have the best software developers.According to a recent study by code-based challenge and recruitment platform HackerRank, China and Russia boast the most talented developers over a number of programming disciplines. Chinese developers are extremely proficient at challenges based on mathematics, functional programming and data structure and Russian developers crush algorithms.Across all the posted challenges accepted and completed by developers, China had an average success rate of 100%, said HackerRank in a blog post. Russia was only slightly behind with 99.9%. Seven out of the top 10 countries in HackerRank are from Europe. Japan and Taiwan rounded out the top of the developer chart, which was limited to the 50 countries with the most developers that signed up to HackerRank challenges.The U.S. and India—which provide the majority of the 1.5 million developers in the HackerRank community—are a long way back, ranking at 28 and 31st out of the top 50 countries analyzed, HackerRank said. Average scores for those two countries were 78% and 76%, respectively—an indication that the home-grown in the U.S. will have to play catch-up … at least when it comes to completing HackerRank challenges.

14 | Terry Palmatier | 0 | 1554254251261266_1554373721249319 | I don't blame them.  What's that back door key Microsoft has built in to their new versions of Windows called, UEFI?  It allows Microsoft to spy on ANYBODY anytime they want to.  And they do.  And they turn everything they find over to the government.
15 | Paul Whitehouse | 2 | 1554254251261266_1554308174589207 | Yeah, good luck with that, Vladdie Boy. Russian hackers are legendary because they use NON RUSSIAN SOFTWARE AND COMPUTERS. I got a look at your aircraft carrier. If your software and computer systems are anything like that floating disaster then I don't think the west has much to worry about.
16 | Lacy Mitchell Liles | 1 | 1554254251261266_1554290867924271 | Well they better help Wiki real quick then and get all the fixed documents out of the country. When the Russians start using their own 'stuff' nothing will work. That is great news, and Gates doesn't look too worried. lol
17 | Nelly Aldarondo | 1 | 1554254251261266_1554326857920672 | The liberal media trying to blame Russia which are defenders and protectors of there own people!! To my understanding that is to be admired. Take responsibility for the disgusting criminal behavior and stop blaming others!!
18 | Brian O'Mara | 3 | 1554254251261266_1554420337911324 | Well I guess NBC News needs to report on something else to deflect attention away from Hillary Clinton sense the FBI said that their was no evidence of Russian involvement in her emails!!

20 | Steven Schick-Morris | 0 | 1554254251261266_1554300064590018 | WHATEVER, I wonder how much Putin's cut of that contract is. The Czar needs a few more billion dollars in his personal accounts.
21 | Joseph Rodriguez | 1 | 1554254251261266_1554260257927332 | It is important that the Inited States get back on a "calm," cooperative, and peaceful relationship again with Russia. Trump will probably do exactly that, and it seems he and Putin are in "Favor" with one another already.
22 | Frank Valdez | 0 | 1554254251261266_1554284671258224 | lol I can imagine the headaches.. sounds like they are preparing for war in case the US makes MS take down russian systems or indentify the softwares vulnerabilities
23 | Kety Lombardy | 2 | 1554254251261266_1554271454592879 | Bill & Hillary Clinton will never own up to their crimes or deeds.Hillary blamed a 12 year old rape victim girl for her rape, she blamed Bill's rape victim for their rape, she blamed Colin Powell for her private server, she blamed Donald Trump for the violence at his rallies incited by her paid anarchists, she blamed Russia for her rigging the election against Bernie Danders and now she is blaming Jim Comey for the 650,000 emails found on Anthony Weiner's laptop.Next she will blame God Almighty & the American voters for losing the election. That will be very TRUE though.
24 | Agnes Njoh | 1 | 1554254251261266_1554320531254638 | Lolol. Oh Bill Gates seems traumatized. #BoyByePutinWell I guess there will be some positives. There will be less email hacks because we know their products are crap and everything will run extremely slow! They will barely be able to access their own systems let alone hack anyone!
25 | Debra Benyshek | 0 | 1554254251261266_1554344931252198 | Charles Seibert, Russia is a geopolitical foe, meaning they are not friend nor enemy and can not be trusted 100%. We will never give them the Keys to the City, but with conditions, we work with them and allow them to do business in America. That is it.
