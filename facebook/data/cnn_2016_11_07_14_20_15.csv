For example, we find you reading this comment right now, which does not contain any useful information, only curiosity, that drives you to waste your time. Have a good day.
2 | A.J. Pinto | 886 | 10155570241116509_10155570242546509 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
3 | Jenny Mora | 359 | 10155570241116509_10155570248756509 | The Trump trolls will be throwing temper tantrums tomorrow when Trump is OUT üòÇ trying so hard üò≠ Poor things.üíôüíôüíô we are not fake votes, WE ARE REAL and we are voting. I'm with her.
4 | Mike Sadicario | 330 | 10155570241116509_10155570251621509 | you love our country so much that your voting for a candidate that is backed by the people that fund ISIS ... And is hands down the most corrupt person to EVER run for the highest office.. LAUGHABLE
5 | William Johnson | 306 | 10155570241116509_10155570241626509 | After this election is over, Trump should enroll in Zoolander's school for kids who can't speak English good and can't do other stuff good too.
6 | Douglas Vogt | 188 | 10155570241116509_10155570262896509 | Anna is one of my favorite CNN commentators. Sorry you didn't have a worthy Republican to vote for, but thanks for putting party aside and doing what is best for your country.
7 | Johnathan Hardcastle | 156 | 10155570241116509_10155570254251509 | Ana Navarro has been speaking out against Trump in a BIG way this entire election... I would argue that she is NOT a lifelong Republican. That's hilarious
8 | Bob Beaudreault | 75 | 10155570241116509_10155570253251509 | There is no spot on the ballot to cast a vote "against" anyone.......... YOU VOTED DEMOCRAT! Plain and simple...... live with it!
9 | David Day | 52 | 10155570241116509_10155570256366509 | Well my lifelong democrat wife voted for the Donald. Last CBS poll which had Hillary up by 2% had 8% dems voting Trump to 6% of Rep voting for Clinton.
10 | Quentin L Hayes | 41 | 10155570241116509_10155570259481509 | Finally a Republican with morals and values who saw through his B.S.. I would vote for you Ana because you are one of the few in your party who remains to have common sense still.
11 | We stand with Israel | 37 | 10155570241116509_10155570259091509 | Here in Israel we support TRUMP! Obama was truly one of the worst presidents the United States ever had, Clinton will be the same.
12 | Willie Peterson | 23 | 10155570241116509_10155570270421509 | All these Hillary haters on her throwing out the same things over and over! She corrupt, EMAILS, been in politics for a 30 years and hasn't done nothing! Ok. Donald Trump has been running a campaign and in politics for 18 months or so and already has a worse reputation than she does! So I'll take everything Hillary has to offer and then some over him anyday! #Hillary2016
13 | Johnnie Lee Maynard | 40 | 10155570241116509_10155570247631509 | Clinton News Network, what the heck are you going to do come wednesday? I see a lot of people losing their jobs there as it seems all they do is look for someone to agree with you.
14 | Derrick Burke | 17 | 10155570241116509_10155570251486509 | I will not cast a vote this election. I do not believe either candidate will significantly shape my life/well-being in the next four years. I know that is a selfish thing to say but I cannot in good conscience vote for Trump or Clinton. Maybe I will just vote third party....
15 | Mike Smith | 14 | 10155570241116509_10155570251381509 | I'm voting for Gary Johnson! Screw this corrupt two party system! We need more options then two decades-long friends who just happen to be "against" each other.
16 | Lek Boonmo | 9 | 10155570241116509_10155570265346509 | Thank you Anna and all Hispanic voters for building a beautiful wall together to keep Trump out of the White House.
17 | Susan Serota | 6 | 10155570241116509_10155570259476509 | There's a place for you on our side, Ana. I love you on CNN. You are one Republican I still respect and admire. Stay in the public eye after the election! You have many fans! Best,
18 | Elizabeth Ann | 4 | 10155570241116509_10155570275446509 | She's my hero. #CountryOverParty Speaker Paul Ryan and a host of other Republicans can take lessons on what it means to have courage and conviction.
19 | Zach Kerman | 22 | 10155570241116509_10155570245136509 | Hillary Clinton does not care about you or anyone else. She only answers to Corporate America and Wall Street. She is not your "champion". That being said, neither is Donald Trump. It's time to end the Two Party system that our fore fathers warned us about. They said it would be one of the worst things to happen to this great nation. Vote to audit the Federal Reserve, limit the powers of the CIA, and to bring the control of the government back to the people and not big business. United we stand, Divided we fall.
20 | Danilo Figueira Chaves | 4 | 10155570241116509_1178940518859679 | That woman is decent! And she can see the disaster of electing Mr. small Hands Trump, she is a republican like many other that knows the difference of racist, hateful and a bigot who want to divide this country in half and bring another war to the world! Good for You Ana Navarro! Thank u for not disappoint us and be a decent human being! Every other woman who is voting for Trump has no self respect! That's all!
21 | Humberto Sanchez | 2 | 10155570241116509_1178941112192953 | ‚ÄúWhen Mexico sends its people, they‚Äôre not sending their best,‚Äù Trump said in June 2015. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre bringing drugs. They‚Äôre bringing crime. They‚Äôre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.‚ÄùThis is an insult to me, my parents, my entire family, right down to my little Boy. In all fairness, Hillary hasnt been an angel herself. However, we know the political system is fraught with ridiculous inquirie, but there comes a point where we have to unite again. Tim Mak wrote, "The last 17 months have brought insult after insult to the Hispanic community, from Trump‚Äôs suggestion that they are associated with crime, to his proposal for a deportation force, to his suggestion that a federal judge could not be fair to him because of the judge‚Äôs Hispanic heritage. Trump‚Äôs comments in Reno were merely the parting blow of a candidate whom most in the community despise." -- TIM MAK (DAILY BEAST) Sadly, this is where we are at....Again...! Irregardless of who you voted for or the outcome, I Praying God brings unity to OUR country again...
22 | Carolyn Peterson | 5 | 10155570241116509_10155570274861509 | I hardly ever agree with Ana Navarro on policy matters but I have come to really respect her during this election cycle. She put our country ahead of party and it takes integrity and strength to do that in our polarized country.
23 | Paula Estanislau | 2 | 10155570241116509_10155570274876509 | Ana Navarro has dignity.And that the white uneducated racist trash around Trump will never understand.I may disagree with her on a political view but i respect her for her decency and frontal courage to stand against the tide of insanity that rolled over the GOP.
24 | HBobbie McLeod | 2 | 10155570241116509_599534153591071 | Much respect . . . that's how I felt when I switched over to vote for and support Barrack Obama . . . One has to do what one feels is in the best interest of our country.
25 | Crystal Jimenez | 6 | 10155570241116509_10155570270876509 | Fact: The Republican Party was founded primarily to oppose slavery, and Republicans eventually abolished slavery. The Democratic Party fought them and tried to maintain and expand slavery. The 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery, passed in 1865 with 100% Republican support but only 23% Democrat support in congress

"Was it talking or singing?" Donald J. Trump mocked hip-hop as he criticized the performance JAY Z and Beyonc√© delivered at a rally for Hillary Clinton

1 | MiVoz MiEstilo MiFlow | 1720 | 10155570133316509_10155570138036509 | Trump is the WORST thing to ever happen to America. He has made people HATE again. He has divided a nation that will take forever to heal and he has done it through his racism, hate, and bigotry. He is a con a crook and sexual pervert that belongs behind bars.

3 | Brianna O'Brien | 351 | 10155570133316509_10155570145696509 | You realize everyone likes Jay Z and Beyonc√©, right? Like the MAJORITY of people like them as musicians and celebrities. That's why they're famous. So, here's a tip; when everyone else in the world disagrees with you, you're probably wrong.
4 | Cristina Vira Rio | 314 | 10155570133316509_10155570147581509 | He's such a racist fool... if Jay Z ran for President, he'd beat Donald in a heartbeat and Jay's companies are way more successful...just saying
5 | Shevanie Chin Townsend | 200 | 10155570133316509_10155570143701509 | Why is a wannabe president going after a rapper? Have some respect for yourself and cool your hot temper. He's just mad he don't have any celebrity supporting him. He's too angry without self control to be president.
6 | Jillian Dziki | 188 | 10155570133316509_10155570142361509 | I think celebrities should stay out of it! It would be a cold day in hell before anyone tells me who to vote for! It really angers me! I'll be voting Trump!üá∫üá∏

8 | Zach Kerman | 124 | 10155570133316509_10155570134296509 | It will be over when Trump wins North Carolina. Just wait until you see the large influx of Trump supporters tomorrow who were too afraid to speak up this entire time in fear of being assaulted by 'tolerant Liberals'. I know the Globalist Liberals are going to hate hearing this, but starting tomorrow, its going to be #AMERICAFIRST
9 | Juan Ramirez | 86 | 10155570133316509_10155570141456509 | Donald Trump all the way!!! Deport BLM supporters back to Africa and deport illegals back to Mexico and bring our jobs back!!!

11 | Mark Senatore | 33 | 10155570133316509_10155570154691509 | Hillary and Michelle Obama were so shaken by Donald Trump's language but apparently have no problem with Jay Z and his filthy lyrics. Throw in Obama and you have the 3 biggest hypocrites in the world.
12 | Brandy Alderson | 37 | 10155570133316509_10155570153241509 | In his own words! Trump just made a "BIGLEY" mistake. Jay-Z & Beyonce are highly respected artists that are supported by a vast majority of American people from all walks of life!

15 | Svetlana Borowka | 19 | 10155570133316509_10155570151231509 | In Europe today the newspaper are full about the consequence we have to face when Trump wins. Everybody agrees that it would be the biggest catastrophe for the USA since Vietnam. But sadly this Madman will drag the rest of the world as well in the pit. The USA lost all credibility during this election and the half of the country became a Hollywoodfarce. We all pity the rational Amercians who face the reign of Dagobert Duck on Viagra.
16 | L.S. Larsson | 14 | 10155570133316509_10155570148931509 | Brags about selling crack , tells you blacks are oppressed  but made millions from mostly white supporters, influences  segregation & I should vote for who he says to vote for ? Haaa
17 | Shawn Paquette | 10 | 10155570133316509_10155570189431509 | I hate Trump but he's right about that bahahaha. Rap and hip hop = garbage. Nothing to do with racism. It takes no talent or skill. Oh, you can rhyme? Grats. Play an instrument.
18 | Justin Cox | 3 | 10155570133316509_1225975310794755 | Never forget, Trump had Lil Jon on the Apprentice one season and the ONLY reason he got fired was because he "did not pass an interview" when the other two people in the competition were white! Of course he hates rap, and hates rappers!
19 | Mara McMullen | 7 | 10155570133316509_819278124880952 | Why is everyone up in arms about Jay Z and Beyonc√© performing for Hillary Clinton? Who cares who gives their opinion on who to vote for. Ultimately, you have your own mind and can vote for who YOU want. Done.
20 | Mazi Okonkwo | 1 | 10155570133316509_1768876143362761 | You wannna know what will happen to America due to the elections? Look at what happened to Nigeria due to the 2015 elections. Electing a known but imperfect substance is always better than electing a flawed but strong personality. People vote the "strong man" hoping that he will change the system. But revolutional changes are not what states should do. States, especially very ethnically-diversed and politically-polarised states should change gradually through reforms. Anything other than that will be disastrous. And more over, people thinking the Presidency will change Donald Trump are not different from people who thoughtthe Presidency will change Muhammadu Buhari. Old men don't change,especially when they are above 70years. If they are dictators and have no idea about how to unite a country, they won't change overnight, especially when they have an army of irrational supporters. When they are egolomaniacs at 70 they still won't change, they stick to what has led them all their lives. History will look at this moment and ask "what they hell were Americans thinking?"
21 | Betty Donovan | 5 | 10155570133316509_819277368214361 | He's such a MORON! I can't wait to see how he's going to deal with the fact that Hillary Clinton will be voted in as our next PRESIDENT. He should be thinking of that, more than being jealous, and slamming JAY Z, and Beyonce'. He's a real LUNATIC!!!!!!!
22 | John Plunk | 5 | 10155570133316509_10155570164151509 | I have to question the intelligence of anyone who bases decisions concerning politics, morals or life goals on the advice of a rapper. Rapper is the native american term for a person who can't sing or play an instrument.
23 | Emerson Williams | 2 | 10155570133316509_1768877946695914 | No he didn‚Äôt. He said they were singing or talking or something. He obviously don't listen to rap, the man is in his 70s. Stop believing every spin CNN puts out. By the way I am 30. I know about hip hop.
24 | Alex Daniels | 0 | 10155570133316509_623138624535436 | Believe it or not there are a lot of blacks that support Trump lol I know a good bit who's voting for him. This might be the one election where a bunch of minority's vote for someone "Trump" but lie to ppl who ask them if they voted for him or not. Its real easy to say to someone that you're voting for Clinton then change it once getting to that booth. Hillary will never have my vote George Bush care more about minority's than Hillary Clinton does. And she's crooked I'm gonna write in my vote this year just to exercise that right.
25 | Mike Vander Ploeg | 1 | 10155570133316509_1768877890029253 | Meanwhile emails showing the DNC is deep in pedophilia and many believe Hillary has had direct impact on the death of several people are released but yea..... this is more relevant to the presidency..............

8 | Arthur Todd Orey | 28 | 10155570011226509_10155570014931509 | Hillary and the establishment want totalitarianism, which is a political system in which the state recognizes no limits to its authority and strives to regulate every aspect of public and private life wherever feasible.Totalitarian regimes stay in political power through an all-encompassing propaganda campaign that is disseminated through the state-controlled mass media, a single party that is often marked by political repression, personality cultism, control over the economy, regulation and restriction of speech, mass surveillance, and widespread use of terror. A distinctive feature of totalitarian governments is an "elaborate ideology, a set of ideas that gives meaning and direction to the whole society.
9 | Kirk Delson | 5 | 10155570011226509_10155570225871509 | As far as campaigning goes, Trump has outperformed Clinton as far as budgeting and stamina. Clinton has blown ridiculous amounts of lobbyists money and refuses to contribute her own cash towards the campaign. It's a joke. That's just a taste of how she's going to be running the country, spending and spending like Obama is doing now. Obama is blowing hundreds of thousands of tax payer dollars to campaign with Hilary instead of doing his job.
10 | Matthew Tanner Moore | 3 | 10155570011226509_10155570276981509 | If you think Hillary is a good choice or even a good person for that matter you have been watching to much CNN and not paying attention to the actual emails, transcripts and other documents that have been coming out. Also lets not forget she is still under investigation as part of the FBI investigations into the Clinton Foundation which includes a lot of the worse offenses including play to pay during her state department tenure and excepting "donations" from countries that support terrorism. Yes they have returned some of this money but that was only once it came out what's to keep her from doing this again as president.

12 | Richard Adebola-davids | 3 | 10155570011226509_10155570286066509 | Folks, make your votes count for America ... This is a battle for America, and despite his shortcomings, Trump is the one, who is aligned with the American people, very much unlike Hillary, who is all out there for no one, but herself and her crime partners/criminal accomplices! America will rise again with your support for Trump!! Now, it's a make or mar!!! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
13 | Thomas Vescelius | 2 | 10155570011226509_10155570136521509 | What would be interesting is, if for nothing else than to give the DNC something to think about, that Connecticut might go Red. After five or more years of budgetary problems, a catastrophic plan called "Fast Trak" its time for a change. Therefore, I ask voters to vote Republican in Connecticut on Tuesday.  Take the gamble, what do we really have to lose? ;)
14 | Drew Weise | 0 | 10155570011226509_10155570234801509 | Fiscally liberal agendas will lead to a welfare state. Socially conservative agendas will lead to divisions among people and hate between different groups. I'm sticking with the party that is fiscally conservative and socially tolerant. Hopefully after the election, the millions of Republicans who disavow the party but still wants some fiscal responsibility and at the same time can handle having neighbors with different social values will join the libertarians
15 | Ebele Ozomma Nwaokobia | 4 | 10155570011226509_10155570095056509 | Stop comparing Obama and Hillary. ..She can never match the kind of support Obama got!!Mitt Romney isn't as devious and a master manipulator like Trump..so yeah he will outperform him.
16 | Larry Denenberg | 6 | 10155570011226509_10155570100186509 | Don't understand anyone over 65 voting Trump. He will totally bankrupt social security, and leave us hanging while he sits on his golden toilet throne.
17 | Tashi Delek | 1 | 10155570011226509_10155570228131509 | Time for outside monitors and foreign monitors to make sure no bus load of illegal voters come in after hours to vote. Keep watching those voting places until those ballots goes to the city hall or we have to call in the FBI
18 | Lastavius Darby | 2 | 10155570011226509_10155570053556509 | A political party should not try to do the job of the Holy Spirit. Period! If God doesn't force himself on people... then a party shouldn't try to force God on people. If you don't like gay marriage ... then don't get gay married. If you don't like abortion... then don't have one. If you hate green eggs and ham... then don't eat it. We have to learn to respect others with whom we disagree. My wife had an ectopic pregnancy and because we live in republican controlled  Alabama... we had to jump through hoops just to have the unviable pregnancy removed because it is considered abortion. There was no way the baby (cells... at this point) would live and my wife was in horrendous amounts of pain. We were given the run around but thankfully we finally found a doctor  willing to help. We were told she was mere hours from death. Republicans don't consider the circumstances like rape, incest, or the health of the mother. They want all kids here but  when they are... Republicans try to cut social programs like food stamps and Medicaid that help families to stay afloat. Vote Democratic up and down the ticket because our families depend on it!
19 | Eileen McGovern | 4 | 10155570011226509_10155570048671509 | If the stocks went back up to 18,600 she would probably be a shoe in but with stocks still being down from its highest point it doesn't look good for her and the Obama Administration.

22 | Michael Schneider | 2 | 10155570011226509_10155570123371509 | Trump outperforming Romney is no surprise to anyone. He was a republican joke. Still is. Hilary underperforming in that state is only a shock to her brainwashed voters
23 | Deling Ren | 2 | 10155570011226509_10155570099121509 | Clinton can afford losing all toss up states (NC, FL, NH, 2nd district of ME) and still win. Trump has to win all toss ups and pick off a lean-D state. Possible? Yes. Likely? No.
24 | Aryka Chapman | 1 | 10155570011226509_10155570135056509 | What are the deplorables going to do Wednesday when their guy has not only lost but lost REALLY badly? That's scarier than him as president.

Cnn adds to most conflicts by innuendos. Slicing words in the spin room, like "underperformed" Who owns CNN ? Republican?

We're with CNN Senior International Correspondent Arwa Damon in Irbil, Iraq, who just spent 28 hours with Iraqi special forces as they pushed into ISIS-held Mosul, and came under attack multiple times. Any questions? Ask in the comments. http://cnn.it/2fLXKNV

1 | CNN | 22 | 10155569872786509_1812540229020035 | Read Arwa's stunning story: 28 hours: Leading the Mosul attack, under fire, then trapped http://cnn.it/2fLXKNV

3 | Kakoli Palit | 30 | 10155569872786509_1812540819019976 | Really admire your bravery Arwa... have seen all your reports on CNN... may Good above all keep you safe and your reporting on this fight against evil... prayers with all...
4 | Chibuike Obih | 26 | 10155569872786509_1812542195686505 | I pray that God will protect our beloved CNN crew members who work their hearts off to bring us the news from Iraq. Peace!!
5 | Thasin Sardar | 17 | 10155569872786509_10155569925946509 | Nice work Arwa ! Unlike the 2003 invasion's embedded reporters doing their bidding for the US Mil, in this case you thrust yourself on to the front lines. Mad respect for your fearless journalism.
6 | Joseph Joey Velez | 15 | 10155569872786509_556348807893988 | You guys need to understand. There will be always war, no matter which president is elected. Only difference will be how they can handle such situation.
7 | Peggy Taylor Cabe | 10 | 10155569872786509_556348701227332 | This is the Armageddon that ISIS has been preparing for. It's a horrific battle that will have terrible collateral damage. Such a high price to pay, but it's the only way IMO to tear out ISIS's heart.
8 | John Bumbino | 10 | 10155569872786509_10155569930916509 | I don't see why we can't build a refugee city in the middle east somewhere and house them there... It would be cheaper and much safer for all...
9 | Gloria Rodriguez | 9 | 10155569872786509_10155569933501509 | Bush should have never got us involved in this war. The Bush administration caused all this mess, that has left this horrible circumstances. Prayers to all who are suffering from this.
10 | Paul Leone Jr. | 3 | 10155569872786509_10155569920126509 | What is Iraq's plan to keep more extremist movements from catching on in northern Iraq again? It seems like many of these people in Northern Iraq are somewhat sympathetic to radical Sunni elements.

25 | Jerad Johnson | 4 | 10155569872786509_556349557893913 | Yes, I have a question. Is it okay that Hillary Clinton and Isis are both largely funded by the government of Saudi Arabia? And what, if anything, should be done about that?

1 | Luke Thompson | 321 | 10155569799011509_10155569820046509 | When I hear news reporters anymore all I hear is, "Hi, I'm a news reporter for CNN and my pathetic occupation requires me to be biased and brain dead. My profession is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the corporation I work for and the declining party I represent." (It's not only CNN but all of journalism)
2 | Joseph Martin | 268 | 10155569799011509_10155569804446509 | Getting my Hennessy and wings ready to watch trump supporters get butt hurt after he loses
3 | Zach Kerman | 119 | 10155569799011509_10155569802176509 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
4 | Wanda Jewel Taylor | 51 | 10155569799011509_10155569816846509 | And cnn thinks this is newsworthy. How ridiculous can you get? But as usual, they make a non story into a big deal. What is wrong with these little people.
5 | Mel JV | 33 | 10155569799011509_10155569820951509 | Yes I copied it and pasted this from the NY Times because it's amazing. I simply cannot wrap my head around how others with level heads and sound minds can even consider Trump for president of this country and leader of the free world. The logic simply escapes me. I try to view it through the lens of economic anxiety, diminished economic mobility and global pressure. It all seems understandable, but then I‚Äôm reminded of Donald Trump, a billionaire whose businesses have on more than one occasion gone bankrupt, who stiffed contractors, who outsources the making of many of his products and who brags about not paying federal income taxes. All of which brings me back to: Are you kidding me? I try to view it through a purely ideological lens in which people simply tend to vote for the party nominee. It makes sense, but then I‚Äôm reminded of Donald Trump, a man who isn‚Äôt really an ideologue but a demagogue interested only in self-aggrandizement. And again I return to: You‚Äôre kidding, right? Donald Trump, who is dragging traditional conservative paternalism into the muck of perversion, who brags about sexually assaulting women, who makes fun of the disabled, who savors a lust for vengeance, who says he has never needed to seek forgiveness, even from God. Again, are you kidding? I try to think of it from a strict constitutionalist‚Äôs perspective, to understand how strongly they want the vacancy on the Supreme Court to be filled by a constitutional purist. But then I think of Trump, whose Muslim ban would fly in the face of the Constitution, whose threats to the press strike me as constitutionally hostile, whose advancement of torture would seem to me constitutionally questionable (to say nothing of its legality in the face of international norms and treaties). Are you kidding, America? I try to think of it in terms of weariness with Washington and with D.C. insiders, the Clintons in particular, and dynastic democracy in general. I try to think of the intense Clinton distrust and even hatred that exists in some quarters, sentiments only exacerbated by things like this never-ending email saga. But then I hit Donald Trump, a real estate scion who has been sued nearly 1,500 times and is currently being sued for Trump University deceptions and the rape of a 13-year-old girl. You have got to be kidding. There is no way to make this make sense. Believe me, I‚Äôve tried. Donald Trump is a bigot. Donald Trump is a demagogue. Donald Trump is a sexist, misogynist, chauvinist pig. Donald Trump is a bully. Donald Trump is a cheat. Donald Trump is a pathological liar. Donald Trump is a nativist. Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign has proved too attractive to anti-Semites, Nazis and white nationalists, and on some level the campaign seems to be tacitly courting that constituency. Donald Trump ‚Äî judging by his own words on that disgusting tape and if you believe the dozen-plus women who have come forward to accuse him of some form of sexual assault or unwanted sexual advance ‚Äî is an unrepentant predator. To put it more succinctly, Donald Trump is a lowlife degenerate with the temperament of a 10-year-old and the moral compass of a severely wayward teen. There is no way to make a vote for him feel like an act of principle or responsibility. You can‚Äôt make it right. You can‚Äôt say yes to Trump and yes to common decency. Those two things do not together abide. If you are voting for Trump, you are voting for coarseness, corruption and moral corrosion. Period. And if you are not actively voting against him, you are abetting his attempt to hijack American greatness and sink it with his egotism. On Election Day, America faces a choice, and it‚Äôs not a tough one, but a stark one. It is the difference between tolerance and intolerance. It is the difference between respect and disrespect. It is the difference between a politician with some flaws and a flaw threatening our politics. Donald Trump is America‚Äôs existential threat. On Tuesday, America has an opportunity to defend itself.
6 | Douglas Cervantes | 25 | 10155569799011509_10155569904431509 | So it turns out Trump contributed 56 million to his own election.  The heavy majority of those funds were used to pay various Trump companies for inflated costs of services they provided.  So Trump is profiting on his own donation that he gets to deduct.  This pretty much sums up how Trump screws America and why he is a loser.

We can not make smart intelligent business change in America without Trump for president you have to win electoral votes the people have to vote for you or we are screwed good luck God Bless you I pray üôè‚úùÔ∏è you win this election Hillary has sent bus loads of Black African Americans into Florida to vote she uses White women Latinos Black disabled she lies you have always hired all to build and work in your companies she can not run this country will be a 4 year disaster I strongly among others think the American people if you don't win will over throw the government because the Clintons are multi million Aires such liars so corrupt like mafia pay buy their way their votes criminals we will have a mess if she with illegal votes wins this election we can only pray that you will win electoral votes majority votes Election Day News Media states you have to win Florida or it is over I pray not among many Americans you are the only one that can make America strong and great again
8 | Stephen Lewis | 9 | 10155569799011509_10155569876991509 | With all the last-minute campaigning that Mr. Trump is doing, all you potzers can think of to cover is 21 seconds of nonsense? You people are guilty of professional dereliction.
9 | Rebecca Gervasi | 3 | 10155569799011509_1598687213761356 | Watch the video Juliann Assange put out from Ecuador yesterday. He is the founder of WikiLinks. He talks about the fact that Donald Trump is a common person and does not come from old money. The people in the United states are divided about who should be president. Under the last president we lost 40,000 factories of each factory had thousands of employees, all these people lost their job and left millions of Americans out of work. Our country has been putting regulations on people who own businesses to the point where the business cannot make any money trying to produce a product here in the United States, as a result, many American businesses moved away to places like China or Thailand, and moved their technical support services to India or Pakistan. Americans are left with no jobs or a way to support themselves so they wanted a change. They were hoping that Donald Trump would be that change. He could do better in business negotiations with foreign countries, maybe he could help bring some factories back to the millions of people in America who lost their jobs. The wall is a symbol of trying to keep out the drug cartel . Violence in America has gotten really bad, Americans are tired of the murders. There is a gang in the nearby town, Santa Maria, the drug cartel murder people in that town every month. The wall will slow down the drug trafficking between Mexico and the United States. The drug issue here is the worst I have ever seen it and we are watching as our children over dose on Heroin that is brought in through Mexico. The drug cartel needs to stop killing our children through violence and drugs. That is what the wall is about. Social media will continue to make fun of both candidates. That's what they do, the election will be close, the elite ruling class (Clinton) or the hard working American who made his way through the American dream that hard work pays off (Donald Trump). We will see. This election is very close, like watching a football gameIf you want a free market, vote Republican.

That's really funny. Tune-In to Fox News Channel if you want to hear right-wing conspiracies and lies. On CNN they report REAL NEWS.
12 | Nikhil Saha | 7 | 10155569799011509_10155569877686509 | Mr. Trump should buy about an hour prime time on national TV and address for the nation on today, 11/07/2016, this is a one life time opportunity for him and America. He will have a landslide like Reagan.
13 | Debbie Reed Ramey | 7 | 10155569799011509_10155569853091509 | A few moments ago a live broadcast was done by CNN where a reporter was in the room where paper ballots were being counted. The state of Ga had a press conference this morning & plainly said the certified people counting paper ballots are in a room, no cell phone or communication with the outside world. Why then is a reporter for CNN  in a room with ballots. She had no business there. People wonder why Trump made the comment he did at the last debate about accepting the results for a reason.
14 | Jennifer Lenell Small | 2 | 10155569799011509_10155570036501509 | Gosh... look at what they are reporting for network ratings!! üòÇüòÇüòÇCNN did not have plenty to be thankful for last month, having plunged 44 percent in prime time vs. November '98.CNN wasn't the only cable news network to experience that sense of weightlessness November-to-November, but its decline was by far the steepest.
15 | Felissah Waller-redfearn | 3 | 10155569799011509_10155569971666509 | Watch the board here people,When Trump get offended he fight back with defensive derogatory remarks,When Hillary get offended she handle things with grace and poise.Trump is a menace his a self absorbed man and it would be a BIG mistake if we put him in the White House

This man is made to be President of the USA , Hillary is nothing but a liar and a traitor........
17 | Lynda Quinton | 0 | 10155569799011509_10155570037121509 | I think this is the person in the world should be President. Just look at a the small business people his has screwed, and small business in the states are a huge part the economy. Donald J. Trump is a joke and certainly would have the business if it wasn't for his daddy. He keeps saying he's winning but he isn't and he doesn't. If you think things are bad now can't imagine how bad it would be if that idiot got elected, and I'm not even American.
18 | Sam T. Abraham | 1 | 10155569799011509_10155569964886509 | Everyone seems to focus on how he's worth so much money and is supposedly such a great businessman...but ignore the multiple times he's gone bankrupt. Maybe he thinks if he puts the US into bankruptcy, it will wipe the slate clean like in a bank/business situation?
19 | Dan Durham | 1 | 10155569799011509_10155569960966509 | This is as good as it gets for Trumptard these days... admiring his own mask!  :-(     You're done Donald... hang up the mask, get rid of that squirrel on your head and lose the orange makeup.
20 | Dick Clark | 5 | 10155569799011509_10155569867036509 | This is also how I feel. It's almost over for me. Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!

2 | Sonja Maingot | 8 | 10155569714186509_10155569776196509 | On his Fox show, Hannity asked if anyone ever noticed how fond Democrats are of accusing Republicans of things Democrats themselves are guilty of, which most, if not all, Americans know only too well, and have already surmised by now that the flip side of this coin is that accusations hurled by Democrats are essentially confessions of their own guilt. The people need a long overdue break. After almost 8 years of Socialist Democrat rule, the American people are taking a look at what they‚Äôve been handed and are adding up the final score: high unemployment, underemployment, high personal and corporate taxes, an economy diminished by business flight and closures and poorly negotiated trade deals, job losses, staggering health care costs, less disposable income, skyrocketing crime rates and sanctuary cities, drug inundation, an open border and floods of illegal immigrants, a failed education system, a nation divided and polarised, a dangerously weakened military, loss of respect for the U.S. worldwide, neglect of wounded veterans, anti-Christian bias, an Iran on the threshold of nuclear power, decaying infrastructure, a callous disregard for the nation‚Äôs security, and the beat goes on. Systemic political incompetence and corruption in the Democrat regime has left 4 U.S. Embassy personnel dead in Benghazi and destabilised much of the world with radical Islamic terrorism; ISIS is the political eruption.Democrats don‚Äôt really seem to like the American people. For the past 8 years, they turned their backs on the people and ran the show for the benefit of the country‚Äôs elite class and illegal immigrants. The traditional support by African Americans for Democrats was treated with disdain over the years and has brought them nothing in return. The Democrats lavished large sums on medical care, welfare and housing for illegal immigrants and Syrian refugees while ignoring the plight of people living in the inner cities. Donald Trump addressed this when he asked African Americans what they had to lose by trying something different. How that must have infuriated Democrats! Hillary Clinton insulted the people supporting Mr. Trump by referring to them as a ‚Äúbasket of deplorables‚Äù. Her privately admitted dream of permanently open borders and the flooding of America with foreigners of unknown background and intentions is her way of destroying the essential American character of the Great Republic, entrenching Democrat Socialism, and possibly even establishing a one-party Socialist state. She‚Äôs definitely not Presidential material. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs only notable though crooked success in her political life was the money machine she helped build around the Clinton Foundation that rapidly made the Clinton family very rich by selling political favors and even control of national resources to people and countries happy to profit from her avarice. The Clintons and Democrats lost all integrity when they exalted lying and corruption to virtues.Donald Trump is fighting so incredibly hard down to the wire and with the eye of the tiger to bring back an America that works for all the people and not just for the elite class. The people have nowhere else to go; there‚Äôs only one America and it‚Äôs theirs. Americans just want their country back. Donald Trump has the leadership qualities to undo the harm done to the country on all fronts by Democrats and once more unlock the vast potential of the Great Republic, strangled for too long by insane policies imposed by their shallow and disturbed minds, and generate millions of jobs and new opportunities for her dynamic and talented people. This time around, with a leader like Donald Trump at the helm, it will be all about the American people and their country; as he said recently, he has only one special interest ‚Äì the American people. It‚Äôs up to the people now to take back their country. They must make it happen with their votes and their prayers. A vote for Donald Trump as President is a vote for America and all she means to her people! VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP!

Do not be taken in by someone that thinks and loves Hitler, Stalin, and all dictators and does not like anyone that is not in his walk of life. If you think he is for the people you are crazy he is for TRUMP only.
4 | Kysha Tarell | 1 | 10155569714186509_10155569876946509 | A vote 4 trump is a vote to restore AMerica to its great glory. We need to be feared and respected, not belittled and a constant pushover. Our population can not support additional citizens, illegal or future dependents. This is why SOcial Security will collapse by 2030, and minimum wage will decrease. We would have to set up birth limits, increase taxes, and close borders if we continue down this path. Democrats no longer care about blue collar workers; they only support elitism and white collar professions. Notice that Hollywood flocks to support Democrat politicians. Our manufacturing jobs need to stay here. Otherwise our children will not be able to work and turn to crime to support themselves.

6 | Richard Eisenberg | 2 | 10155569714186509_10155569776456509 | Jeff Sessions15 hrs ¬∑ ‚ÄúI am shocked that the President of the United States‚Äîwho is the chief law enforcement officer for the nation and to whom all federal law enforcement officers report‚Äîfailed to strongly and immediately object to a statement by an interviewer that unlawful immigrants can and should vote in U.S. elections. The interviewer proposed a radical and illegal action, which the President had a duty to condemn.The President must immediately issue a statement to make crystal clear that only citizens of the United States have the right to vote, and that any noncitizen who votes, and anyone who assists noncitizens to vote, does so illegally and is subject to prosecution. The failure to clarify this statement will only add further credibility to the public‚Äôs concerns about the integrity of this election.‚Äù

25 | Katarina Mamula | 0 | 10155569714186509_10155569790676509 | Since Democrats in this elections are supporting Hillary, why she is qualified and how a woman that lied repeatedly to American people can be a president? Seems like Democrats are not capable of reasoning themselves except they are fed info by their favourite news networks, CNN, NBC, ABC, and the New York Times. Democracy is the regime of society that will lead to inevitable rule by the mob, mass-uneducated, and unintelligent who will subject their vote towards tyranny of the few. We already saw this tyranny happening with Obama, many weren‚Äôt able to find a job they thought they will instead they live on basic welfare assistance and many more lost their jobs they held for years. Democratic citizens, many and poor, are easily swayed by the emotion and deceptive rhetoric of ambitious politicians and the media. So, majority rule of uneducated citizens, who time and again, have supported many disastrous campaigns, that they themselves did not understood, have been responsible for support of American and the world disaster that awaits us. Never Hillary self-manipulative evil women who only cares for her family and herself.

2 | Monika Tor | 1 | 10155569651376509_10155569683856509 | why are you lying? if  win trump, it will be like in Poland? it ve been made a coup on the media i poland? you do not even know when the first constitution was adopted in Poland, and that was the first in Europe. you have no idea how the constitutional tribunal in Poland is elected. there is no totalitarianism in poland , but for you it is not convenient (another hypocrisy TV station)

Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ
6 | Tina Kumley Barnes | 0 | 10155569651376509_10155569747521509 | First we all need to get educated. We need to find out who HIllary really is. We are all minions to HIllary and she is not a fan of anyone but herself. Julian Assange was asked last week why all the stuff on Hillary, where is the stuff on Trump. His answer was there is no stuff on Trump.. Trump is a good man who loves his country, is a billionaire, was part of the elites and has turned on them to help the minions. Hilary is a Satanic cult worshipper, who likes sex with 12 year old girls, has abused women and forced them into silence whether it was over rape or over having a black child of Bill's. The Secret Service said she was a mean one. And she lied to Congress, lied to the American people, will say anything including smearing and cheating in her competition ask Sanders, ask Trump and has no respect for anything but money. Her unfinished business is code for getting Syria to fall so she can get her oil line put from middle east through Turkey and then through Syria into Europe. The problem is that Russia Syria's ally so she cannot get that done without WW3 so a vote for HIllary is a vote for WW3 while a vote for Trump is to get rid of Obamacare. Hillary may say What difference does it make but I say "See the difference?" http://dennismichaellynch.com/jaw-dropping-segmenthillary-clinton-email-hearing/

1 | William Carroll | 17 | 10155568579526509_10155569044241509 | If in fact hilary wins, it will be the death of the small christian colleges-which is in many ways not a bad thing because they truly offered nothing that the state universities do not-and they cost three times as much, have worse facilities, faculties not involved in research which make them obsolete and spend more time on propaganda than education. I do not know where they money for "free education" will come from-my guess is taxes-but anyone with a child should start realizing that, unless that child get a scholarship to Harvard, Yale, Duke, Stanford, or other such prestigious schools with prestigious alumni contributing to massive endowment for the school, your child will be much better off going to the state universities

Crazy right? I am sure ‚Äúit is just a coincidence‚Äù! I mean what else could it be? Shame on the dems, shame on them for using the name ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù. I know a man who is a bit more democratic than them, he is the president of North Korea, maybe you know him too. He has some similar methods of silencing people, but a bit more subtle than the democrats in America.VIA BeforeitsnewsInvestigators believe FBI agent, Michael Brown, 45, shot and killed his 33-year-old wife, Susan Brown, late Friday night before setting the couple‚Äôs home on fire and then turning the gun on himself. Brown was a 12 year veteran of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department before spending the last six years in the FBI.Neighbors saw smoke coming from the Brown residence and called 9-1-1 at approximately 11:50 p.m. By the time fire crews arrived on scene minutes later, the entire house was engulfed in flames.‚ÄúMrs. Brown‚Äôs death was caused by a gunshot wound prior to the house fire,‚Äù Walkerville Police Chief Pat Frederick said, ‚Äúwhile Mr. Brown‚Äôs single-bullet head wound appears to have been self-inflicted.‚Äù‚ÄúThe totality of the evidence leads us to believe this is a murder-suicide. We believe he killed her, set the house on fire and then took his own life,‚Äù Frederick said.The findings support conclusions by investigators Saturday that the couple perished in a murder-suicide during which the 4,000-square foot house was intentionally set on fire. Authorities outlined a likely scenario based on interviews with neighbors and comments posted on Mr. Brown‚Äôs Facebook page.Brown is believed to have started the gasoline-fueled fire but spared the life of his beloved beagle, Dixie. ‚ÄúPrior to the fire, he dropped off the dog at a neighbor‚Äôs house,‚Äù Frederick said. ‚ÄúHe put the dog in a neighbor‚Äôs backyard.‚ÄùA neighbor told WHAG that Brown appeared ‚Äúpanicked‚Äù though it is unclear whether his wife was dead before or after the dog was removed from their home.The motive behind the killing is still being investigated, but police say Brown was a highly respected agent with the FBI and very well liked in the community. ‚ÄúWhat leads someone to this level of anger and violence with your wife, your loved one, who knows,‚Äù said an FBI official who knew the Brown family.Conspiracy theories are running rampant throughout many alt. right media outlets, leading many to believe this was another ‚Äúhit job‚Äù by the Clintons in retaliation for the FBI email leaks so close to the presidential election. Media outlets like Alex Jones‚Äô Infowars and WND are running with the theory that globalist assassins, working for the Clintons, had the Brown family murdered and their home burned to destroy any possible evidence.FBI Director James Comey refused to comment at this time but asked for privacy and prayer as the bureau comes to terms with losing ‚Äútwo very close friends.‚ÄùSearch for: SEARCH ‚Ä¶CATEGORIESCategoriesCopyright ¬© 2016 | MH Magazine WordPress Theme by MH Themes

Before releasing the heavily redacted email to Judicial Watch, the State Department marked it ‚ÄúB1.4(b)‚Äù and ‚ÄúB1.4(d),‚Äù indicating that it contained ‚ÄúForeign Government Information‚Äô and ‚ÄúForeign relations or foreign activities of the US including confidential sources.‚Äù The State Department also misleadingly labeled the email with the term ‚Äúnear duplicate.‚ÄùNo wonder Hillary Clinton deleted this email.

2 | Adam Rose | 972 | 10155568454221509_10155568460426509 | Of course Khizr Kahn is on CNN this morning. I'm still trying to understand the riff between him and Trump. Trump never attacked his son. He was simply responding to an attack by Mr. Khan. Could Trump of handled it better...Of course. But to portray it the way the media has is a disgrace to his sons death.

5 | Zach Kerman | 221 | 10155568454221509_10155568457946509 | Regardless what one thinks of Trump this election has shown how biased media is and how corrupt a Hillary administration would be. ABC, CNN, and NBC are just a few of the major news networks that should never be trusted as a legitimate news source again.

17 | Andrew Keen | 22 | 10155568454221509_10155568506631509 | A MUST READ FROM A TRUE PATRIOT - Chris Mark, US Marine and Navy VeteranDear Mr. Khan,I want to preface this letter by stating that I respect your son‚Äôs sacrifice for this great nation. By all accounts, he is a true hero that sacrificed himself in service to our country. For that I am thankful.As a veteran, I watched your comments at the Democratic National Convention with a mixture of sadness, and anger. The United States has a military comprised of volunteers. Every single member has made the conscious choice to join the military and serve. There is not a single service member who has been forced into service. It is important for all service members (and apparently, their families) to understand that service to this great nation does not imbue one with special privileges or rights. I found your comments troubling when you said: ‚ÄúHave you ever been to Arlington cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one.‚ÄùDoes it matter whether Mr. Trump has sacrificed ‚Äú‚Ä¶nothing and no one?‚Äù‚Ä¶has Ms. Clinton ‚Äú..sacrificed‚Äù for this nation? How about Mr. Obama? Your comment stating that Mr. Trump ‚Äú‚Ä¶has sacrifice no one‚Äù is alarming. Are you intimating that YOU sacrificed? Sir, your son willingly sacrificed himself. As a father I cannot imagine the pain you must feel but his sacrifice is his own. He was not forced to serve.I am troubled that you would allow a party that has little more than contempt for the US Service Member to parade you into the DNC to denounce Donald Trump. Did you watch when protesters at the DNC booed and heckled Medal of Honor recipient Capt. Florent Groberg? Did you notice your party interrupting the moment of silence for slain police officers? Your own hypocrisy in not denouncing these acts and instead using the DNC as a platform to make a political point is disgraceful. The simple fact is that whether one served or sacrificed does not give greater power to their statements. One vote is as valuable as another. That sir, is why our Country is great. Your condemnation of one person for a statement while standing idly as your party disparages veterans and police officers is the height of hypocrisy.To conflate the need to prevent potential terrorists from entering our country with the belief that ‚Äòall Muslims‚Äô should be banned is simply wrong and disingenuous. As a reminder, Mr. Trump said: ‚Äù ‚ÄúUntil we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,‚Äù The irony of your son‚Äôs own death at the hands of these very people in Iraq should not be ignored. I have little doubt that your son would have recognized the need to protect our country from these very people. In fact, he held is own troops back so that he could check on a suspicious car. Your son understood sacrifice and how to protect ‚Äúhis people‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Äôhis soldiers‚Äô‚Ä¶.‚Äôhis fellow Americans‚Äô‚Ä¶As you continue to make the media circuit and bask in the glow of affection cast upon you by a party that has little regard for your son‚Äôs own sacrifice, and veterans in general, I would ask you to consider your comments and your position more closely.Respectfully,Chris MarkUS Marine and Navy Veteran.

The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie.

1 | Steven Cordero | 150 | 10155568320301509_10155568329716509 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.REASONS TO NOT VOTE HILLARY‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible?

(Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks?

Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ please cut and paste on your wall if you agree.

What happened to social graces‚Ä¶ hey, they're still around for some of us. The Donald forced me to vote Independent, because of his antics. He can't admit when he's losing and that is so sad, but it reinforces some to vote for another, which he did for me! I had to imagine him as leader of our country, when he knocks down every one in his way that may hurt his feelings‚Ä¶ DONALD GROW UP! Your children will be effected, by all you have done while in this race. After all this email stuff came back yesterday, not in his favor he still will continue to knock down everyone who was responsible for clearing her‚Ä¶ Geez come on Mr. Trump admit you are a loser!
15 | Dennis W Khisa | 12 | 10155568320301509_10155568333526509 | Can't wait for this election to be over so the influx of deplorable spam on CNN can drop again, just watch ,on Tuesday they'll cry so much they might just drown in their own tears...but don't worry I'm sure Russia's navy will be more than glad to rescue you..
16 | Rajaƒçiƒá Petar | 20 | 10155568320301509_10155568345851509 | DNC staffers prepared CNN anchors Wolf Blitzer and Jake Tapper for interviews with Trump, new batch of 8,000 WikiLeaks emails reveals. Check Daily Mail.
17 | Ronald Brown | 10 | 10155568320301509_10155568414001509 | Why no mention of Wikileaks emails showing Wolf Blitzer was given questions from the DNC they wanted asked of Trump in an interview? This after Brazile left when emails showed she gave Hillary questions to debate. UNBELIEVABLE!! This network is a complete joke and should be prosecuted.
18 | Mandic Mira | 2 | 10155568320301509_10155569778351509 | Scandalous is that Hillary is not already in jail. He's already proven that he lied to the content of e-mails, in which it was confidential information that was trying to destroy evidence. This is just treason.It is good that there is Wikileaks and people that actually care about justice and truth.Probably is now desperate and is trying to win the election at any cost, because that is the only way to remain at large.
19 | Steve Lowery | 5 | 10155568320301509_10155568493956509 | If Hillary Clinton gets into office I really think that would be the beginning of the end.

We need to stop killing cops, abusing our children and all of the other terrible things that are spiraling out of control. Vote Trump!!!

23 | Sheri Kos | 0 | 10155568320301509_10155568664691509 | FBI AGENT & HIS WIFE FOUND DEAD After Being ACCUSED OF LEAKING HILLARY‚Äôs EMAILSVIA| FBI agent believed to be responsible for the latest email leaks ‚Äúpertinent to the investigation‚Äù into the democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private email server while she was Secretary of State, was found dead in an apparent murder-suicide early Saturday morning, according to police. Crazy right? I am sure ‚Äúit is just a coincidence‚Äù! I mean what else could it be? Shame on the dems, shame on them for using the name ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù. I know a man who is a bit more democratic than them, he is the president of North Korea, maybe you know him too. He has some similar methods of silencing people, but a bit more subtle than the democrats in America.VIA BeforeitsnewsInvestigators believe FBI agent, Michael Brown, 45, shot and killed his 33-year-old wife, Susan Brown, late Friday night before setting the couple‚Äôs home on fire and then turning the gun on himself. Brown was a 12 year veteran of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department before spending the last six years in the FBI.Neighbors saw smoke coming from the Brown residence and called 9-1-1 at approximately 11:50 p.m. By the time fire crews arrived on scene minutes later, the entire house was engulfed in flames.‚ÄúMrs. Brown‚Äôs death was caused by a gunshot wound prior to the house fire,‚Äù Walkerville Police Chief Pat Frederick said, ‚Äúwhile Mr. Brown‚Äôs single-bullet head wound appears to have been self-inflicted.‚Äù‚ÄúThe totality of the evidence leads us to believe this is a murder-suicide. We believe he killed her, set the house on fire and then took his own life,‚Äù Frederick said.The findings support conclusions by investigators Saturday that the couple perished in a murder-suicide during which the 4,000-square foot house was intentionally set on fire. Authorities outlined a likely scenario based on interviews with neighbors and comments posted on Mr. Brown‚Äôs Facebook page.Brown is believed to have started the gasoline-fueled fire but spared the life of his beloved beagle, Dixie. ‚ÄúPrior to the fire, he dropped off the dog at a neighbor‚Äôs house,‚Äù Frederick said. ‚ÄúHe put the dog in a neighbor‚Äôs backyard.‚ÄùA neighbor told WHAG that Brown appeared ‚Äúpanicked‚Äù though it is unclear whether his wife was dead before or after the dog was removed from their home.The motive behind the killing is still being investigated, but police say Brown was a highly respected agent with the FBI and very well liked in the community. ‚ÄúWhat leads someone to this level of anger and violence with your wife, your loved one, who knows,‚Äù said an FBI official who knew the Brown family.Conspiracy theories are running rampant throughout many alt. right media outlets, leading many to believe this was another ‚Äúhit job‚Äù by the Clintons in retaliation for the FBI email leaks so close to the presidential election. Media outlets like Alex Jones‚Äô Infowars and WND are running with the theory that globalist assassins, working for the Clintons, had the Brown family murdered and their home burned to destroy any possible evidence.FBI Director James Comey refused to comment at this time but asked for privacy and prayer as the bureau comes to terms with losing ‚Äútwo very close friends.‚ÄùSearch for: SEARCH ‚Ä¶CATEGORIESCategoriesCopyright ¬© 2016 | MH Magazine WordPress Theme by MH Themes

Hillary's supporters are the type of people who will do and believe whatever their government tells them is true. Trump's supporters have a brain of their own and make their own choices! Have a good day everyone!
2 | Chris Shipman | 103 | 10155568305711509_10155568327451509 | Here's an awesome fact. The majority of Republicans and independents vote on election day. Democrats have always voted early as possible. Today and tomorrow trumps numbers are going to go skyhigh just wait-and-see

7 | Donna Burton | 21 | 10155568305711509_10155568359031509 | Just keep in mind that Hillary Clinton plans on drastically increasing your taxes, reducing social security and raising the fines for those who can't afford to pay for health care premiums.

10 | Alaria Taylor | 5 | 10155568305711509_10155568533896509 | Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:‚Äú(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.‚ÄùYes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.  Post this everywhere

And keeping America safe during these times will be the greatest challenge of our next president.

Maybe it will wake up Washington. Also I live in Oklahoma, Trump has a 97% chance of winning our electoral votes.

Man or woman, someone is going to take your job for less than you. That person may only have small bills to pay. You however, have a home for your family, cars, a lifestyle. Schools. Keep the border closed, you can keep your lifestyle.

13 | Sashia E'lise Rogers | 2 | 10155568184406509_10155568218426509 | Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library.  Word for word from the Cornell Law Library  Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:"(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term "office" does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States."Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States."Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.Can you help hold Hillary accountable?

18 | Amy Prewitt Lee | 2 | 10155568184406509_10155568220321509 | Please repostREMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care.Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection.After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations.She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply.She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation.Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense.Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . .She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?)After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.Please Share this bit of history with your friends! Especially the younger voters! Share with voters in Pa, in Va, in NC. in Fl. We need these states to win !

5 | Jamaican Carlos | 336 | 10155568096306509_10155568142231509 | Im a republican but we must be honest trump is not fit for president. Whenever i'm home watching tv with my family i always have to keep the remote handy just incase he said something crazy. Who wants a president like this? Most of us republicans have learned a valuable lesson, and never again would we want to associate ourselves with a candidate like trump. With that said, trump leaves me with absolutely no other choice but to vote for my country over politics. Lets cover our pride and do the right thing vote for Hillary.
6 | Stacy Guillory | 254 | 10155568096306509_10155568097766509 | Think about this: When did the Morals of the people of The U.S.A. start going to the devil? I tell you when, when the American people said that it was ok for the President of The U.S.A. ( Bill Clinton)to have sex with an intern in the Whitehouse while on duty, when the people said it was ok for the President ( Bill Clinton) to rape a woman, to expose himself to another and to sexually assault two others. When the people said it was ok for his wife (Hillary Clinton) to send Private investigators to dig up dirt and threaten these women.   When the people Reelected Bill Clinton and Elected Hillary Clinton as senator.

10 | Razvan Costi | 87 | 10155568096306509_10155568105926509 | One thing i still cannot get past: why doesn't the US simply switch the voting system to one that recognizes and accounts for every single vote ACROSS the US instead of this convoluted state-by-state system (at least for president)?

15 | Ross Messina | 49 | 10155568096306509_10155568122331509 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.REASONS TO NOT VOTE HILLARY‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much? Over 20% of her campaign is funded by Saudi Arabia, a country that treats women like dogs and believes gays should be executed.Who is left? üëÅ please cut and paste on your wall if you agree.
16 | Thomas Coyne | 34 | 10155568096306509_10155568102721509 | Correction: Voters in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire are deciding that perhaps Hillary Clinton is less criminally insane than Donald Trump.I, on the other hand, think it's too close to call.
17 | Manish Khatri | 66 | 10155568096306509_10155568121401509 | According to state polls CNN will be banned after the elections...keep it up nasty reporters..your pro Clinton image will soon collapse and your legend will come to an end..keep manipulating the voters by your dirty propagandas...
18 | Compai Viruet | 15 | 10155568096306509_983910308404296 | Clinton drawing more support from Democrats (95%) than Trump does from Republicans (86%). Clinton is also powered by her edge among women and college-educated voters, while men and voters with a high school degree or less form the base of Trump's support.
19 | Jay Davio | 22 | 10155568096306509_1221585694587355 | Which is hilarious cuz hillary can't even fill a soccer field with supporters and her live feeds are nothing but angry faces and insults. Trump is filling stadiums and nothing but support. But yea, the election isn't rigged üëç
20 | Nelly Takis | 19 | 10155568096306509_990838737728154 | I would be surprised the other way around since all the mainstream media are not keeping impartial but openly supporting the corrupted Clintons and selectively ignoring eye-opening wiki leaks revelations..
21 | Fari Brathwaite | 22 | 10155568096306509_990851774393517 | Sorry Trump supporters but Trump won't win. Clinton is already at 275 electoral votes and Trump is at 188. And I'm sure you know you need 270 to win. And if that doesn't convince you look at it like this... Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are all leaning towards Hillary. And if she wins Florida alone she wins the presidency. And so far early voting puts Florida in Hillarys favor. And if by some chance Trump does win Florida he still wouldn't have enough to win the presidency. He'll need to turn at least 3 or 4 other states that are already blue or leaning blue his way. Which at this point is near impossible
22 | David MacLean | 17 | 10155568096306509_1127942977274667 | I don't believe anything CNN reports. They have lied for 2 years. I am amazed that Hillary supporters overlook the pending investigation and the corruption of the past 30 years. I remember Bill Clintons nonsense while in office and Hillary would be the same. Hillary in office will only mean HIGH Obamacare fees and nothing will change. It will be like wasting the next 4 years.
23 | Tim Retell | 14 | 10155568096306509_990863734392321 | The Clintons gave us NAFTA, we compete against nothing more than slave labor created by NAFTA, so you dont tell me you need to be educated to see when your highest paying job in your community is selling drugs we need a change of direction. We cant win the war on our wages under NAFTA, VOTE TRUMP and bring our jobs home.
24 | Millie Oliveros | 17 | 10155568096306509_990864054392289 | Hillary Clinton is a criminal who cheated everything that is going on what happened to the DNC chair then Donna Brazile, the media, wikileaks shows how corrupt the party is and I can't believe people still back her when you should be fighting that your party leaders did that to you.. Disgusting all in all trump is people sick of the establishment trump is for the people who love America and don't want to see us go down, he wants to keep us save and have us prosper again!Breaking NEWS: Wikileaks just released over 8000 emails between the DNC Hillary Clinton and CNN, showing them sending CNN questions to ask Trump, showing them asking to attack Trump, Ted Cruz and his wife, they also say how Trump has no ties between Russia but to push it on him anyways, wow. Go to Twitter or Wikileaks. Org and search #dncleaks2 it's trending top on twitter now, DNC are proven crooks and cheaters and so is Hillary Clinton
25 | Lorrie LaMay | 9 | 10155568096306509_990853641059997 | Every word out of trumps mouth is a Lie just to get into office wait watch and see . Anyone that votes for him. Will be disappointed . I can tell every time I look into his eyes and hear all his speeches ..

3 | Jo Clarke | 280 | 10155568014741509_10155568033486509 | Ironic as Donald Trump hasnt actually killed anyone. Hillary on the other hand supported war in Iraq, was the driving force behind the topple of Gadaffi in Libya which has led to ISIS and oversaw the biggest ever arms deal with the Saudis.
4 | Paul Borne | 140 | 10155568014741509_10155568029676509 | This is interesting. I've seen a local political figure excoriated for tweeting an image of Hillary Clinton on the gallows. Yet -- this article celebrates her opponent being burned by a murderous mob. Hmmmm. CNN -- do you see a problem, here?
5 | John Brown | 117 | 10155568014741509_10155568027821509 | If Hillary is so clean then why is everyone around her pleading the 5th
6 | Jeffrey Clark | 65 | 10155568014741509_10155568032501509 | The tolerant peaceful "stronger together" ideology back at it again. I thought Trump supporters were the violent ones? At least that's what CNN tells me.
7 | TaraMae Land | 44 | 10155568014741509_10155568052246509 | Bill Clinton is a rapist , Hillary was involved in a child sex ring from Haiti , Obama screwed america with Obamacare . but hey , let's talk about how trump was used as a pinata , let's evade reality once more ;)
8 | Brad Dean-McGowan | 35 | 10155568014741509_10155568070526509 | Trump loved the FBI when he thought they had something. When Comey said their previous decision still stands, Trump said it was all rigged again. Is this guy really presidential? I always though people wanted a strong individual to sit in the Oval Office, not whining insecure bully. Bizarre! :/
9 | Mohamed Yusuf | 44 | 10155568014741509_10155568016591509 | Living in Europe I can tell you all republicans including Bush has been seen as nut cases the democrats with their secularism and socialized programs has been seen more civilized and rational around here. The stereotypical  American with his bible and guns and small government view is seen as cultural bizarre.
10 | Jesse G Noto | 11 | 10155568014741509_10155568042646509 | This is exactly the problem with us right now. We are so un-intimidating that other countries think it's okay to do this to someone running for office. If we did this and had a bonfire of one of the leaders of the U.K.? That would be unforgivable. But this is okay? Alright CNN alright.
11 | Adrienne Nathan | 9 | 10155568014741509_10155568110966509 | It's a sad day in America when another country's citizens are more intelligent than we are pertaining to our affairs.... They have sense enough to know that this demagogue should not even have been considered as a candidate....#SadDayinAmerica
12 | Jordan Fredey | 9 | 10155568014741509_10155568094931509 | Ugh. He brainwashes people to believe that he will actually build a wall and kick out the illegals. He was right when he said the poor uneducated people are his favorite people. He knows they are all supporting him!
13 | Paula-Lawson N Casey-Knight | 8 | 10155568014741509_10155568091231509 | Christian's, are you praying? Tomorrow is the day. God tells us that if we pray, and seek Him, and turn from our wicked ways He WILL answer us and WILL heal our land. I urge you to pray today. Pray without ceasing. Pray every time you think about it. Beg Him for mercy on behalf of our country. God is merciful and He is faithful. And no matter who wins tomorrow, He is ALWAYS in control. "If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land." 2 Chronicles 7:14
14 | Matt Taylor | 7 | 10155568014741509_10155568211391509 | I love that they did this to Trump but it would also be fun to see them do this for Hillary as well. Poke fun at both, but poke more fun at Trump, it's funnier to see how he can't take a joke.
15 | Jacqueline Munian | 7 | 10155568014741509_10155568223891509 | Tomorrow will be the new 5th of November...where we'll all get the opportunity to witness  Dumold Thrump  become the new... Guy fox...and watch him go up in a puff of smoke....good riddance...
16 | Bill Lince | 9 | 10155568014741509_10155568080316509 | Trump is loud and obnoxious, says what he wants, thinks he can do what he wants with women, and is smarter and superior to everyone in the room.  Holy crap...he is the drunk at a party!!
17 | Rebecca Savastio | 5 | 10155568014741509_10155568081631509 | Instead of reporting on Trump's pending fraud case for Trump University, plentiful lawsuits and all of his other vile behavior, you wasted hundreds of hours of time talking about a BS story, which deeply damaged HRC and down ballot Democrats. Your choices have permanently altered history for the worse. How does it feel to know what you have done? Disgraceful.
18 | Karen Rounds Pisacane | 5 | 10155568014741509_1790141841239393 | Get over it losers. Hillary isnt as corrupt as you wish she was. You all were just jealous of her husband & what he did for our country & are afraid she will do same. Say bye forever to trump tomorrow cuz this will be the biggest embarrassment of his life. He will go under ground & hide for a while.
19 | Melissa Challenger | 4 | 10155568014741509_1221656321234107 | We are sorry, Brits. Trust us, millions of Americans are just as disgusted and horrified at our fellow countrymens support of this sick, demented sociopath. We promise he will be gone in about 36 hours - hang in there with us! #ImWithHer
20 | Elisa Maza | 7 | 10155568014741509_1790114791242098 | So you're voting for Donald Trump because he thinks he's going to bring jobs back to America? ........seriously dude????What reason could you possibly have for thinking that? Look at his history, he already had ample opportunity to provide manufacturing jobs to the US with his Trump suits that are made in Mexico, his Trump shampoo imported in Hong Kong or the $350 million worth of steel used in his hotels that he purchased from China. But he didn't do that because he'd rather line his pockets then contribute to our economy. But NOW you think he's got your best interest at heart? And even if his concern for American jobs was genuine and not just about his ego (he's going to be the greatest jobs president God ever created? Seriously?) how exactly does he plan to achieve this? We've lost 5 million manufacturing jobs over the last 20 years or so. And he has you thinking that we just lost them to other countries (again, this is including the ones that HE sent overseas) but that's not the case. Those jobs are gone because they're just not needed anymore. Technology has greatly improved over the last few decades and we don't need nearly the amount of workers to manufacture our products as we once did. And the United States is still highly competitive when it comes to manufacturing. About 2/3 of the durable goods that we use and 3/4 of the non durable goods that we use are in fact made here. So regardless of who becomes president, we're not going to see an increase in manufacturing jobs. Those days are gone. What we need is to invest in learning other skills that are more suited for our changing economy. And we certainly don't need a president that can't even admit to something simple like climate change and how it can effect us.
21 | Chris Schwenk | 2 | 10155568014741509_1221732131226526 | Now let's talk about double standards shall we? There was a naked statue of trump. Everyone laughed. Everyone shared. Then someone made a naked hillary statue.  Outage ensued. Now we have "the burning of the trump" and everyone thinks it's hilarious. But if they had "the burning of the hillary".... well you guessed it. Seems my fellow millenials are fine with humor, until it's at our own expense.
22 | Jose Alarcon | 4 | 10155568014741509_10155568159756509 | This Will always be remembered as the presidential election when the KKK, KGB and FBI all backed the same candidate... !!Not the nasty woman, the orange buffoon!!.. He shall meet a fiery end here too with ballots. We are almost there .. #imwithher
23 | Maria Sousa | 5 | 10155568014741509_10155568043271509 | Nazi Germany had the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. America has the mainstream media. Same movie, different actors.
24 | Susan Sharman | 0 | 10155568014741509_10155568158671509 | I can not believe how many people is making a big deal out of this. Heck half the people in America don't even know who Guy Fawkes is. I work in a store in Louisiana and we sold Guy Fawkes mask and people were buying them but had no idea who the mask was suppose to be, which I did tell them..lol This is a celebration that takes place every year and people are freaking that Trump was chosen as part of their celebration? People need to get a grip and I can say this because I voted for TRUMP. Some people just need to take a chill pill..lol
25 | Melvynne Ndimba | 0 | 10155568014741509_1221749347891471 | Lol...burn him down baby. Bravo!! Don the con said he'll bomb the heck outta ISIS and supports the NRA but runs for cover like a little chicken for a guy with papers in his pocket. Wow that was staged af to get sympathy conspiracy votes. So hoax, it smells. No one attempted to assassinate the orange pos. Even if they did why didn't he stand to face the bullet. The big bad wolf is all bark and no bite....lmao. I've that recorded and can't stop lmao. Extremely funny. #FakeAssassinationAttemptBTW didn't the orange head said he could stand on 5th Ave and shoot someone and still won't lose any votes...so why the heck was he running from the nonviolent guy with a paper. He can dish out stink from his fatty mouth but sure can't take it. Shows us how he'd react if things were reversed...run for dear life lmao. But u can shoot someone freely and won't lose votes.....wow

Ever wonder how CNN works behind the scenes on election night? This is how returns are analyzed before results are ever announced http://cnn.it/2f9mTjU
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Richard Head | 538 | 10155567943641509_10155567958491509 | How CNN works behind the scenes:1. Hillary Clinton's camp calls them early in the morning and tells them what to do. 2. They do it. 3. They look really dumb for doing so.
2 | JM McCormack | 304 | 10155567943641509_10155567951271509 | They can't be trusted anymore.. they are bias and gave Hillary questions for the debates..They just don't understand people want honest trustworthy news not one sided ..
3 | Shekhar Agrawal | 121 | 10155567943641509_10155567972576509 | I know how CNN works behind the scenes; Play into hands of clintons.. very biased - probably appropriate name will be Corrupt News Network (BTW - not a fan of Trump though)
4 | Eileen Tharp | 70 | 10155567943641509_10155567959316509 | If Hillary Clinton wins this country will be more Divided, her wall street friends(including her son in law) will become richer and the middle class poorer. The inner cities will remain in turmoil and poverty. The job market will be bleaker. Economic growth will be stagnant. The national debt will grow so that even our children and grandchildren won't be able to pay it. Our military will be weaker setting us up for attack from the outside as well as inside.Babies will be slaughtered. Good healthcare will be a memory.
5 | Vam See | 59 | 10155567943641509_10155567970866509 | Is this how you work behind the scenes? I thought u just call DNC and ask what kind of programs to do and what kind of news to telecast!
6 | JamesLucky Davis | 48 | 10155567943641509_10155567997401509 | We all know how CNN works crooked dishonesty traitors to the craft what's sad I watched CNN faithfully for 11 years never once did I ever tune into fox I was a fool I have been  mislead by you and now you have awoken a beast
7 | Bryan James | 32 | 10155567943641509_10155568016471509 | Have you noticed CNN does not post live news broadcasts of Hillary or Donald on fb? It's because you can see true support for Trump and anger for Hillary when the emojis are flying by. CNN is definitely bias and definitely spins the facts. They are not a real news station.
8 | Igor Rastovic | 47 | 10155567943641509_10155567951981509 | No one cares, you're not news network you're comedian TV station people used to laugh at.
9 | Anthony Lobasso | 47 | 10155567943641509_10155567968286509 | Not sure, but I'm sure we will find out after next wikileaks email dump. You guys are disgusting. I hope Wolf gets fired and you lose viewers after election.  You guys are so quick to report about corruption in the private sector where's the transparency in your company now? You guys are a disgrace
10 | Ann Fanticola Mignano | 14 | 10155567943641509_10155568006281509 | Not watching your coverage. Horrible journalism. And with Anderson Cooper having words with Kelly Ann. Was the last straw. Anderson your Hillary hates everything you stand for. So why are you defending her like this. Oh I get it you got paid off too.
11 | Bruno Byrd | 13 | 10155567943641509_10155568018836509 | CNN use to be the news channel to turn to to get the latest breaking true news. Now we find out that it is no more than a tabloid sensational "news channel" whether your a dem. or rep. this is so disappointing. Shame on all of you at CNN. I`m glad the truth came out on you and the Clintons!!! You deserve each other. Never again CNN.
12 | Willy Mullen | 10 | 10155567943641509_10155568037716509 | And don't worry we will never forget how you acted during this election the American people will make your ratings plummet cnnüí©üí©üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
13 | Vishnu Shal | 45 | 10155567943641509_10155567951971509 | Being from India and watching in i cannot believe how biased the corporate run media is...even here in India and Europe the only headlines we read are the ones attacking Trump in this one sided election, never any articles about Benghazi or the trail of blood and destruction Obama and Clinton have left across Syria and the Middle East, so much for responsible informed journalism and impartiality...sickening. Trump 2016
14 | John Lair | 6 | 10155567943641509_10155568080186509 | "Behind the scenes?" CNN is OPENLY campaigning for HilLIARy. I would expect to see tears tomorrow night while announcing she lost, except I quit watching CNN years ago. I like to get both sides of a story.
15 | Rakesh Mangal | 6 | 10155567943641509_10155568219706509 | It is shame, Wolf Blitzer requested Clinton campaign for questions before interviewing Donald Trump.It proves that CNN is the extension of Hillary's campaign.
16 | Christine Guidice Morales | 10 | 10155567943641509_10155567997081509 | We already know how CNN works behind the scenes.  Lying and manipulating their brainwashed viewers.  This election would be completely different if the liberal MSM actually reported on an even playing field.  You all should be ashamed of yourselves for not doing your jobs and informing the American people with actual truth.
17 | Mack Warren | 10 | 10155567943641509_10155568020286509 | I hope everyone knows WikiLeaks has exposed CNN....Your watching a Democratic Propaganda Network...Some scary sh*t ...When a political party takes over all main stream media but one network...Ive seen this in other Countries and never turns out good...üòØ
18 | Robert Hamil | 6 | 10155567943641509_10155568028766509 | Behind the scean on election night with CNN.. Okay now everyone read the teleprompter. Hillary won no matter what the results are! Oh and Florida she wins big early!
19 | Luis Salazar | 8 | 10155567943641509_10155568015046509 | The time has come to save our nation from circling the drain with Obama and the point of no return with Hillary. Donald J.

21 | Riya Sharma | 12 | 10155567943641509_10155567969706509 | WIKILEAKS=> CNN BUSTED! Got Complete List of Questions for TRUMP Interview from DNCNo surprise here, We all know CNN is working 24/7 to get her elected... People are smart They will not choose Corruption over Succsfull business man üòè
22 | Abdul Akindele | 3 | 10155567943641509_10155567997576509 | No need to see backroom activities, Brazile being banned and Lewandowski giving all information to Trump and representing Trump yet not being banned says all that needs to be said about cnn.
23 | Michelle Gray Johnson | 4 | 10155567943641509_10155568049371509 | If there was real breaking news I would tune into CNN but no more they have lost all my trust. What else is not real or being slanted a certain way. Wiki leaks is doing what journalist should be doing exposing the truth.
24 | Sam Funger | 9 | 10155567943641509_10155568001336509 | Everyone at CNN are the most disgusting people. We knew it was rigged all along but we now have the proof. No longer a conspiracy!
25 | Debbie Oliviera McQuillan | 2 | 10155567943641509_10155569437096509 | This is hysterical! What genius thought of this topic at this time üòÇ.

Voters in California, Massachusetts, Maine, Arizona and Nevada will decide on whether marijuana should be legal to use recreationally. Three other states on Tuesday will vote on whether to legalize medical marijuana.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | David Sammy Jr. | 337 | 10155567880131509_10155567886266509 | And you all still trying to demonize marijuana,when it was proven to be very beneficial to humans and their many ailments... Youall should tell people about the dangers of tobacco, alcohol and prescription drugs that is responsible for allot of deaths worldwide on a daily basis ...
2 | Nate Burrows | 256 | 10155567880131509_10155567941106509 | Why is this even a discussion?Have you ever heard of a domestic abuse fueled by consumption of weed?Have you ever heard of an overdose of marijuana?How about mass instances of lung cancer, heart disease or emphysema from MJ use?Yeah me neither.
3 | Belinda Younce | 133 | 10155567880131509_10155567915566509 | Why don't we just make this a Supreme Court issue? Legalize, regulate and tax it like alcohol and cigarettes in all 50 states and let law enforcement deal with more important issues
4 | Heather Crowell Brammer | 46 | 10155567880131509_10155567997201509 | I love how they had to throw in "marijuana-related traffic deaths" even though that can not be proven. Make sure you throw out some scary sounding non-fact based information CNN.
5 | Rehberg Hansen | 46 | 10155567880131509_10155567921781509 | Massachusetts will get an enormous BOOST to their economy if recreational marijuana becomes legal. Connecticut blew this opportunity.
6 | Ray I. Smith | 50 | 10155567880131509_10155567958086509 | Its legal here in Washington State and it really isn't a big issue. Good revenue from the taxes and its treated exactly as alcohol law wise. You smoke and drive within a certain period you go to jail, car gets impounded same as booze. No public smoking is allowed.
7 | Mickey Shay | 38 | 10155567880131509_10155568118271509 | Every state needs to legalize it. You can think smoking marijuana isn't a good idea but give the people the power to choose for themselves. It's called liberty. America should try it sometime.
8 | Ben Campbell | 21 | 10155567880131509_10155567989261509 | Fact: mike pence' Indiana arrests 12-14,500/yr for simple possession and charges them with a class A misdemeanor, one step below felony, which is 2 classifications over Indiana's DUI charge. You actually get in less trouble in Indiana getting a DUI than getting caught with a single cannabis seed.Shameful how many lives that boss hog state ruins. They have no plan other than arrest and incarceration, provide no patient access, and its lawmakers are totally inept on this subject.According to NORML, 8/11 Indiana lawmakers have been graded "D"
9 | Thomas Coyne | 24 | 10155567880131509_10155568112756509 | I will never use it, but hopefully 5 more States will have legalized this plant after tomorrow. If alcohol is permitted, there should be no reason why pot isn't.
10 | Michael Edward | 36 | 10155567880131509_10155567882141509 | CNN asked the Democratic National Committee for questions to ask during interviews with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz earlier this year, emails released by WikiLeaks on Sunday show.
11 | Eric L Gallardo | 14 | 10155567880131509_10155567884981509 | Go Trump. The White House was yours all along. I know we're all surprised. But our nation deserves a fighting chance.
12 | Chandler Smith | 12 | 10155567880131509_10155568010456509 | I live in Washington and I was afraid that when we past recreational marijuana there would be a lot of intoxicated people driving not the case at all in fact between taxing and not spending money on court cases our state has a lot more money now.
13 | Teresa Muschott | 10 | 10155567880131509_10155567968766509 | If it's going to be legal in one, it should be legal in all.  Make it recreational so that the dang pharmaceutical companies won't be making a ton off everyone.
14 | Gloria Del Carmelo Johnson | 8 | 10155567880131509_10155567913596509 | Marihuana is the least of my worries. If there were enough jobs for everybody, maybe they wouldn't be trying to get stoned because they'd be occupied doing something else.
15 | Tony Bell | 6 | 10155567880131509_10155568005446509 | Woot woot. Prohibition created the American mob, do what do you think marijuana prohibition contributes to? All those consequences for something safer than tylenol.
16 | Greg Hoffmann | 4 | 10155567880131509_10155568055331509 | It doesn't matter how legal it is with no laws that protect people that use it. As long as your employer can test for it, it's not legal.

It have given birth to the drug cartels, millions of invalid arrests, a deadly black market, 24/7 access for teens, and it has decimated tens of millions of lives. It is idiocy, nothing more, nothing less. We need our police officers chasing criminals, not harassing innocent people for choosing something safer than booze to relax with.
19 | Brian Barabash | 0 | 10155567880131509_1811673582447964 | Until the pharmaceutical companies have their processing plants in place and are in a position to take a stranglehold on the medical marijuana industry it will remain illegal federally.  This is all political stalling after years of political suppresion has finally failed. Now we wait for the drug companies that own the government at its highest levels to move in to a position of monopoly.  Then it will be decriminalized and reclassified for medical use.

23 | Juan Amezquita | 7 | 10155567880131509_10155567919466509 | If we legalize it, the less tax payers money we have to use to prosecute these activities.We will be saving tax money and use it instead on something else.
24 | Amanda Barnes | 4 | 10155567880131509_10155568218866509 | As most know, Colorado legalized. In the areas where recreational sales are allowed, drug related crime rates and heroin/meth use has dropped. They're also flourishing financially. In the areas of CO where they have refused recreational sales, it's the exact opposite. Heroin and meth abuse are at an all time high. School, city, and county budgets are being cut by the thousands because they can't afford it. Almost the entire Western Slope of CO has refused rec sales, and it shows......
25 | Kristi Heavner | 1 | 10155567880131509_10155568234831509 | Arkansas also has it on the Ballot for medical purposes. Issue 6 and issue 7. What's really interesting is what they just pulled in Arkansas. In the middle of early voting they pulled issue seven. Whatever votes that  was cast for issue seven will not count. Which now leaves issue 6.

Remember that while casting you ballot it's going to be your last chance to show the middle finger to the Oligarchs and the Establishment. Give them a big F*CK you tomorrow.

10 | Ania Swiergiel | 1 | 10155567802541509_10155568386376509 | Unbelievable. Even if she didn't kidnap the Koala from the wild (which I doubt) she decided to keep it rather than turn it over to proper caretakers. Pure selfishness and human arrogance. I hope she gets fined appropriately.

This is the same pipeline that they are protesting at #StandingRock Reservation. They are worried that it will eventually leak oil into the Missouri river which is their sole source of water. By the way, The Missouri is not a small river. Think about who all it would affect.Illinois, it will run directly Southwest from Navoo, Illinois, to Patoka, Illinois. What does this mean? It's simple. Not only will it cross the Mississippi River. But it will also cross the Illinois and Kaskaskia river and end up dangerously close to Carlyle lake. In case you don't know, that means that the pipeline will cross every source of water we have in Southern Illinois. If it leaks or bursts, we are ALL in danger..But that is a big "IF"....Well, think about this....Here is a list of every pipeline leak in the U.S. ALONE since the year 2000.https://en.wikipedia.org/‚Ä¶/List_of_pipeline_accidents_in_th‚Ä¶For those of you counting, that is 421 (give or take about 10 depending on my count). Are you ready to protest, too?PLEASE share this!! And go to the page below (https://www.facebook.com/Standing-with-Native-Americans-36‚Ä¶/ ) and like and share the page so we can start a Nation Wide protest and stop the poisoning of this land!!.It starts in #StandingRock.

1 | Susan Payne Coolidge | 57 | 10155567734451509_10155567776556509 | There is only one person you can vote for. We cannot have a country led by a president subject to ongoing criminal investigations, potential indictment and never-ending hearings. We cannot have a president under that level of scrutiny that inevitably leads to even more questions and more investigations. And irrespective of what happens to her, whether she‚Äôs indicted or even guilty, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Her guilt is a moot point, she cannot take the oval office.Now in any other business when the head of a corporation is plagued by scandal, that person steps down and is replaced because the board knows a business cannot succeed without respect and authority. How do you think the world is going to look at the United States when a woman under federal criminal investigation, whose lied repeatedly to the American people is elected? Do you think they‚Äôll take her at her word? How many countries already own her through the Clinton family charitable foundation which was used to raise a minimum of $100 million just for her husband Bill. How many countries like Morocco own her because they gave $12 million for five minutes with Bill?
2 | Paul Winkle | 34 | 10155567734451509_10155567763996509 | Donald is dirty and he throws dirt to distract people. FBI investigated Clinton many times now, they found nothing! I think it is time now to investigate more Trumps dirty games. Maybe it is too late and people got brainwashed by trumps campaign. I don't trust this guy.

I tell you when, when the American people said that it was ok for the President of The U.S.A. ( Bill Clinton)to have sex with an intern in the Whitehouse while on duty, when the people said it was ok for the President ( Bill Clinton) to rape a woman, to expose himself to another and to sexually assault two others. When the people said it was ok for his wife (Hillary Clinton) to send Private investigators to dig up dirt and threaten these women.   When the people Reelected Bill Clinton and Elected Hillary Clinton as senator.

God tells us that if we pray, and seek Him, and turn from our wicked ways He WILL answer us and WILL heal our land. I urge you to pray today. Pray without ceasing. Pray every time you think about it. Beg Him for mercy on behalf of our country. God is merciful and He is faithful. And no matter who wins tomorrow, He is ALWAYS in control.

4 | Allen Palenske | 68 | 10155567679221509_10155567693591509 | 10 QUESTIONS for HILLARY:(1). "When you left the White House after your husband‚Äôs last term as president, why did you steal $200,000.00 worth of furniture, china, and artwork? And why did you tell the public that you ‚Äòreturned it‚Äô when you only brought back $27,000 of it? (2). Mrs. Clinton, when you were Secretary of State, why did you solicit contributions from foreign governments, (muslim princes donated multi-millions and got favors in return) for the Clinton Foundation after you promised President Obama you would not? (3). Mrs. Clinton, why do you and your husband claim to contribute millions of dollars to charity for a tax write off when it goes directly into your Clinton Foundation which only gives out 10% of the funds to charitable purposes and you pocket the balance to support yourself tax free? What does your daughter Chelsea do there for her 3 million dollar yearly salary? (4). Mrs. Clinton, why are you unable to account for 6 billion dollars of State department funds that seem to have disappeared while you were Secretary of State? (5). Mrs. Clinton why did you say you were broke when you left the White House, but purchased a 5 million home, built an addition for the secret service, and charge the tax payers of the United States $15,000.00 a month for their rent, an amount that pays your the entire mortgage? (6). Mrs. Clinton why did you lie to the American people about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, but managed to tell the truth to your daughter that same night it happened? (7). Mrs Clinton were you and your husband disbarred from practicing law? Answer: In 1996, Landmark Legal Foundation filed a complaint asking the court to disbar Hillary Clinton for violating the Arkansas code of conduct, (which requires lawyers to act with honesty and integrity) for her actions in the Whitewater scandal cover up. Hillary‚Äôs law license was suspended in 2002 for failing to complete her continuing legal education requirements. Bill Clinton was convicted by a grand jury for perjury and obstruction of justice to which he was impeached by the House of Representatives and disbarred from practicing as an attorney. He has been accused by a dozens of women for rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. He settled out of court for $850.000 in one case. Hillary has him out on her campaign trail championing for her theme of feminism and "women's rights". What a blasphemy. Neither one has enough integrity to hold onto a law license. (8). Mrs Clinton, why did you say, ‚ÄúI do not recall,‚Äù ‚ÄúI have no recollection,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù 56 times while testifying under oath during the Starr investigations.(9). Mrs Clinton, what Really happened to Ron Brown when he was about to testify against you and your husband? (10). Mrs. Clinton what really happened to law partner Vince Foster? No way he committed suicide.

Janet Reno served as attorney general under President Bill Clinton. She died Monday following a long battle with Parkinson's disease, her sister said.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sassan K. Darian | 333 | 10155567616026509_10155567617031509 | R.I.P. Janet Reno. She was the first female Attorney General. And we are less than a day away from having the first female President-elect as long as everyone goes out and votes and doesn't take the defeat of Donald Chump Trump for granted. Too bad she died a day early before the glass ceiling was shattered.
2 | Damian Moss | 173 | 10155567616026509_10155567634251509 | I don't like her....lots of children died because of her...Waco standoff lasted over 50 days...she could have played with koreash and his giant ego...yes ppl will argue me...but she handled Waco horribly...I was 20 at the time and watched it on the news....
3 | Monica Lolahh | 99 | 10155567616026509_10155567640141509 | Wow!! No wonder this world is so fkdup. The woman died and shes getting bashed over doing her job! Really? Thats a sin people!! let her soul rest in peace
4 | Isaac Anim | 126 | 10155567616026509_10155567623441509 | If Hillary wins I'm leaving the country. If Trump wins I'm still leaving the country. This isn't a condolence tweet, I just want to travel. üòÇüòÇüò±üò±üò±
5 | Lorie Ard Levie | 42 | 10155567616026509_10155567729786509 | I wonder how long it will take until a Trump supporter says this was caused by the Clintons?... Oh wait... That's already happened... [Eye Roll].... RIP Janet Reno üòû
6 | Leo Pascal Arciniega | 61 | 10155567616026509_10155567630246509 | I wonder if her suicide note will be in her hand writing. Clinton probably typed it just to be careful. That's what happens when you know too much about emails.
7 | Doug Berry | 38 | 10155567616026509_10155567642046509 | Our 2nd Female U.S. Attorney General is scared of the Clintons too. Women and children burned to death because of Reno so, rest in Hell.
8 | Ian Frowner | 21 | 10155567616026509_10155567679431509 | May her spirit be gently guided into the bosom of God. May she find everlasting peace and tranquility. Even Unto Eternity. I hope that we can soon find a cure for diseases like Parkinson's before it claims anymore lives.
9 | Gerry Rotondo | 13 | 10155567616026509_10155567902526509 | When some people leave this world, they make the planet a better place. Her incompetence cost a lot of people their lives, and the Cuban kid should NOT have gone back to Fidel.  I don't shed a tear for people who are intentionally bad - or when their incompetence causes harm to others.
10 | Sam Smith | 7 | 10155567616026509_10155567761616509 | I look at her the same way I look at Senator Feinstein...there are people who care about them (family, friends, etc) so in that light I am empathetic for their loss. Beyond that, the political stance of both of them is something this country does NOT need.

13 | Giovani Morgs | 10 | 10155567616026509_10155567646936509 | I want everyone to know that Melania Trump may be a secret spy for the Russians. She wants those nuclear codes badly. Putin knows this and that's why he wants Trump in there so bad. Our national security is at stake. Our republic is at stake. Propechies say that the great power will fall hard. A Trump presidency would cause America to fall. A complete breakdown where no minority has civil rights or liberties. Where foreign powers own us and bring America to its knees. Trump wants to sell America to foreign powers and the same way he screwed American workers for financial gain.
14 | Josh Fry | 9 | 10155567616026509_10155567739916509 | yeah now who is going to kill dozens of people for having a weird religion, or kidnap and deport a six yr old at gunpoint? but hey she was the first woman da, so nothing else matters, right? #sexismatitsfinest
15 | Solange Amado | 3 | 10155567616026509_10155567986916509 | People do know that an investigation into Waco concluded that the lunatics themselves started the fire, right??? So please, explain to me the so called party of law and order, how is this in any way Janet Reno's fault? What scares me the most is that you "geniuses" actually reproduce!
16 | Curtis Mimms | 3 | 10155567616026509_10155567813346509 | Her family have my condolences. She was a strong woman and she made history by becoming the first female attorney general in the US. They need to name every street in America after her.

18 | John Stevenson | 5 | 10155567616026509_10155568064526509 | Waco was on Reno's watch. The firey deaths of women and children were not neccessary. A seige would have sufficed. All be it far less dramaticaly.
19 | Michelle Ruzza | 6 | 10155567616026509_10155568261181509 | Regardless of how you feel about what she did in office...She has passed away...she was a human being with people who probably loved her..show a little respect...that's the problem with people these days...they say whatever they want regardless of the circumstances..time and place for everything people!
20 | Solange Amado | 4 | 10155567616026509_10155567943511509 | So the same people always braying about how we need to accept law and order and how immigrants are all criminals, are all super super pissed off that Janet Reno took Elian Gonzalez and gave him back to his father, as required by law? I live in Miami, I remember. His relatives were blatantly breaking the law and refusing to give him up. What did they expect? I guess it takes more than half a brain to process the concept of hypocrisy, since conservatives seem to not see they are so guilty of it....
21 | Adrienne Bloom | 1 | 10155567616026509_1013554645420396 | R.I.P Janet Reno.  She didn't have an easy job. Anyone who is old enough to remember she had such a great sense of humor going on Saturday night live.
22 | Jewel Davis | 2 | 10155567616026509_1013495915426269 | Look at all the loving christians bashing a dead woman!  Which do you really serve, the devil or God? I can't tell!  Rip Janet Reno!
23 | Rebecca Gervasi | 0 | 10155567616026509_1013639818745212 | Watch the video Juliann Assange put out from Ecuador yesterday. He is the founder of WikiLinks. He talks about the fact that Donald Trump is a common person and does not come from old money. The people in the United states are divided about who should be president. Under the last president we lost 40,000 factories of each factory had thousands of employees, all these people lost their job and left millions of Americans out of work. Our country has been putting regulations on people who own businesses to the point where the business cannot make any money trying to produce a product here in the United States, as a result, many American businesses moved away to places like China or Thailand, and moved their technical support services to India or Pakistan. Americans are left with no jobs or a way to support themselves so they wanted a change. They were hoping that Donald Trump would be that change. He could do better in business negotiations with foreign countries, maybe he could help bring some factories back to the millions of people in America who lost their jobs. The wall is a symbol of trying to keep out the drug cartel . Violence in America has gotten really bad, Americans are tired of the murders. There is a gang in the nearby town, Santa Maria, the drug cartel murder people in that town every month. The wall will slow down the drug trafficking between Mexico and the United States. The drug issue here is the worst I have ever seen it and we are watching as our children over dose on Heroin that is brought in through Mexico. The drug cartel needs to stop killing our children through violence and drugs. That is what the wall is about. Social media will continue to make fun of both candidates. That's what they do, the election will be close, the elite ruling class (Clinton) or the hard working American who made his way through the American dream that hard work pays off (Donald Trump). We will see. This election is very close, like watching a football gameIf you want a free market, vote Republican.

Fresh air doesn't exist in New Delhi at the moment.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Vikalp Sharma | 84 | 10155567574951509_10155567632106509 | Yeah, polluted. But we don't care. We are more concerned with issues like hindus-muslims, beef-pork, south Indian -north Indian, high caste - low caste. Also, we have a clown cm of Delhi, who will blame PM. Then , PM will boast , how can his 56 inch chest will remove pollution.B/w leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi will always try to find an opportunity to save his already fu**ed up political career. This story has no end point. It is running in a loop.
2 | Dev Inder | 55 | 10155567574951509_10155567612996509 | Delhi's air might be polluted, but whats wrong with American people ????They seem to be itching to kill one another just like good 'ol days of American Civil War üòÖüòÖüòÖAre we going to see another one after Tuesday???

What were they expecting? Seriously, fireworks for hours on end. In the UK it was driving me insane that noise non-stop, imagine in New Delhi!
6 | Randy Mennie | 0 | 10155567574951509_10155570211966509 | I've been to Delhi and am going through there again soon. The air pollution is truly incredible. They have millions of motorcycles burning diesel fuel because it is cheaper than gasoline. You can't see more than a few blocks. From a hi-rise building it looks like a foggy day below, but it is actually a patchwork of heavy smog banks in the 40¬∞C heat.Even the countryside has a continuous light fog due to the pollution. Using high-tension power lines as a reference, I can remember usually being able to see only 3 or 4 towers before they fade into the hazeSunrises and sunsets always have a fiery red glow. Although they are beautiful, they are a harbinger of darker days.http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/delhi-pti_650_071114120007.jpg

It's a good thing our air stays right here and that none of the polluters air can come our way. It helps to remember that when thinking of all of the trucking companies that the clean air act is bankrupting because manufacturers haven't been able to come up with a model that actually works without spending thousands on the truck being In The shop constantly. Thank goodness for that.
10 | Dane Campbell | 0 | 10155567574951509_10155567879011509 | Yet global leadership thinks it is better to send more manufacturing and energy needs there and China and South Anerica rather than keep them in the US where we at least have emission standards and efficient resources. I guess there is money to be skimmed by the establishment, though, so such is the naivety of the green left.

She Belongs in Federal Prison already!!The 25 things that are truly important about Hillary instead of this left wing fluff:1. When did she know her husband was a serial abuser, and does she feel guilty for destroying his accusers?2. Explain precisely the trades made in the Cattle Futures scandal where $1,000 was turned into $99,000 in a matter of weeks?3. Why didn't she do anything to protect the Americans in Benghazi?4. Who is Saul Alinsky and why was he her mentor?5. When she was working on Watergate, why did her boss Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, call Hillary a ‚Äúliar‚Äù and ‚Äúan unethical, dishonest lawyer‚Äù and have her fired?6. What really happened with Travelgate?7. What really happened with the Rose Law Firm?8. What really happened with WhiteWater?9. What gave Hillary the right to see private FBI files of her political enemies in FileGate?10. Why won't she turn over her illegal server with state department e-mails to congress?11. Why does your foundation accept money from avowed terror states?12. What is her take on the Vince Foster "Suicide"?13. Why did she think she was entitled to steal the White House furniture when she left?14. Why do you lie even about things that mean nothing: lying about being under sniper fire in Bosnia, lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, or lying that your grandparents were immigrants.15. Should America be concerned that in ChinaGate, the 22 people that were convicted of fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the DNC were associates of Bill Clinton?16. Did selling stays at the Lincoln Bedroom to political donors make you feel like a wh)o(re?17. Does Hillary think Juanita Broadrick lied when she said on national news that Bill Clinton raped her?18. Is she still okay that Bill goes to pedophile island with Jeff Epstein?19. Why are there so many murdered and suicided people in the Clinton's immediate circle?20. Doesn't the fact that the Clinton Foundation has to amend 5 years of its tax returns for improper reporting imply that you were involved in an illegal RICO enterprise?21. Doesn't approving the Russian-owned Uranium One deal as secretary of state--because of illegal contributions to your foundation--in fact make you a traitor to this country?22. Was it wise to have at least four Clinton Foundation board of directors that have either been convicted or charged of the financial crimes of bribery and fraud?23. Why, Hillary, did you pay your female senate staffers 72% of what you paid your male staffers?24. When you represented an accused pedophile rapist, why did you laugh when you got him off even though you believed him to be guilty?25. She said she had one e-mail address, it came out that she had two; She said she had one device, it came out that she had two: She said none of her e-mails on her private server was classified, but when the State Dept handed over 300 e-mails the FBI redacted large sections of one, proving again she was wrong. Thus, Ms. Clinton, are you incompetent or just a congenital liar?Everyone should go on you tube and watch The Clinton Chronicles -- it will amaze you what a couple of psychopaths the Clintons really are!

16 | Brad Drake | 2 | 10155567574951509_10155567846056509 | And the climate is now beyond manageable, the oceans are dying, mega droughts are impacting important crop yields, causing wildfires, We are in the 6th large scale extinction event in Earths history, tens of millions of people are on the move because of habitat loss and this is just the start! We do not have a century to change, We don't have another minute!
17 | Nick Herron | 259 | 10155567574951509_10155567586316509 | I love how everyone is just putting political comments instead of anything related to the actual article. I honestly can't wait until this election is over.
18 | Jessica Crawford | 1 | 10155567574951509_10155568187781509 | What in the hell does any of American politics have to do with this article? You all sound like idiots. Back on topic, how did it get so bad over there? Why don't they have regulations to keep this from happening?
19 | Enrik√™ Russ√™ll | 12 | 10155567574951509_10155567582146509 | Imagine if Trump wins and he lifts all the environmental regulations that are in effect???We will beat New Delhi!!!

21 | Daniel Beling | 1 | 10155567574951509_10155567847296509 | You listen to Hillary and Obama the US was the most polluted. So according to this we are great compared to other parts of the world, so why must we pay more fees and taxes to clean our air, just be happy where we are, and let US companies invent and sell technology to the polluted cities worldwide to help them along.
22 | Namdigui Remei Haokip | 12 | 10155567574951509_10155567590361509 | What has this news got to do with US election that people here are arguing about it? Wake up Muricans, election fever is killing you.
23 | Ray Conn | 0 | 10155567574951509_10155569659871509 | You will not survive a decent living with open borders. Tough paying your bills now? Man or woman, someone is going to take your job for less than you. That person may only have small bills to pay. You however, have a home for your family, cars, a lifestyle. Schools. Keep the border closed, you can keep your lifestyle.
24 | Yvon Jardon | 0 | 10155567574951509_10155570238981509 | I always knew that Trump's idea of bringing back coal mining in a big way , was an idea of genius .. probably not !!!üòàüòà
25 | Tony Garcia | 0 | 10155567574951509_10155567829046509 | To all Bernie supporters. Remember tomorrow will be the last chance you get to tell Hillary and the DNC who blackmailed and stole the election form Bernie to go and F*CK themselves. Remember that while casting you ballot it's going to be your last chance to show the middle finger to the Oligarchs and the Establishment. Give them a big F*CK you tomorrow.

One woman who was waiting with her elderly mother told reporters that Donald J. Trump had lost her vote because of how late he was.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Erin Everest | 1734 | 10155567512811509_10155567518446509 | That's probably because he's doing multiple rallies a day, whereas Hillary will do only a few per month. Honestly you were NEVER going to vote for him in the first place, you just wanted your 15 minutes of fame on liberal media.
2 | Michael Brown | 720 | 10155567512811509_10155567513316509 | Hillary is as innocent as OJ Simpson and Casey Anthony.
3 | Chuck Byron Gross | 362 | 10155567512811509_10155567538311509 | Oh look, another wonderful unbiased headline story from CNN - oh yes, how dare Trump not cater to your oh-so-important schedule, I'm sure what you're doing is so much more important than trying to save the country from the next establishment hack politician
4 | Tammy Shifflet | 126 | 10155567512811509_10155567631811509 | If anything, this makes me want to vote for him even more! Can't say he isn't trying! 5 rallies and 5 different states?! That's impressive! What's Hillary doing? Going to concerts, having Beyonc√© talk for her, and stopping a rally because of a little rain 5 minutes into her speech. That's not a true leader. I'm proud of trump! You go man!!!
5 | Brad Fitzgerald | 114 | 10155567512811509_10155567538026509 | Oh, please...if THAT is her reason, she's an idiot anyway. CNN digs up another way to blast a candidate today...talk about last ditch efforts and digging deep for them!
6 | Karen Michele Handy | 94 | 10155567512811509_10155567564691509 | People who pick their politicians like this is scary. Trump lost her vote only because he was late to a campaign 2 days before the election, that's the only thing that matters.......promptness?? I think that maybe we should go back to taking a test before being allowed to vote
7 | Tom Hoban | 89 | 10155567512811509_10155567574506509 | Now, I'm just a guy from Minnesota, and Trump visited our great state yesterday.  He was a little later than he was supposed to be, he flew into a busy airport.  For all of you Hillary "she's the best" followers out there, when is it right for you to wish that his plane crashes into a hangar filled with 20,000 people?  That's considered just down right despicable in my book.  You're the ones showing the hate, not any of us.
8 | Suleman Danjuma | 55 | 10155567512811509_10155567570721509 | I dont have a choice, with reason dat the both candidate have some behavoural problem, But Trump seems to be right, he speaks his mind, not a pretender, so i go for Trump
9 | Thomas Coyne | 59 | 10155567512811509_10155567537201509 | So, the breaking point as to whether or not to vote for Trump was because he was late?? None of the other stuff drove you to this decision? I smell BS.
10 | Mindy White | 57 | 10155567512811509_10155567538416509 | KILLARY.....her nasty loud voice who calls minorities names....black super predators, Latinos taco bowls, handicapped kids retarded, Oh and Pa white trash, bernie supporters basement dwellers, whites are racist and half of America is illiterate!! but she just kills and lies and takes money from foreign countries illegally. She is a classic corrupt criminal!! And creator of ISIS!!! Oh...don't forget the Clinton Sex Network....child trafficking...what a slug!! Killary is an escapee from a colostomy bag! Now we have another murder suicide in the FBI....coinkydink??
11 | Richie Willson | 32 | 10155567512811509_10155567604826509 | It is pathetic how certain media are trying to shut up Donald Trump. And how the Clintons are trying to push Trump from the presidential race is disgusting. This is corruption pure and simple. They are in no position to shoot their mouths off. They have plenty of skeletons in the closet with their many scandals. Hillary Clinton doesn't flinch at theft, murder, extortion, corruption and abuse of power. She is a bloodthirsty maniac. She is desperate, that is why she is trying to steal votes. She is a blight on the nation. Hillary Clinton and her supporters are useless scum. And everyone who has pulled back his support for Donald Trump is a scumbag. Man, I can't wait to welcome Donald Trump as President. Mr Trump, tear down the corrupt government, burn it to the ground. Then, rebuild America and guide it to true greatness.I have family in the US and i don't want them to suffer because of your foolishness.If Hillary Clinton wins, all of her supporters shall BURN. Best of luck! Trump that tramp!!!!Best regards from Germany!
12 | Nelly Takis | 38 | 10155567512811509_10155567577981509 | It's embarrasing , judging by your headline, how CNN has fallen to sad propaganda levels. Who would have thought that such respectable internationally acclaimed media would sink to third world countries biased level..
13 | Dara Price | 29 | 10155567512811509_931371290297420 | I will be glad when this is over! Do you people hear yourselves- we have become the land of "I'm right your wrong". No one is nice, no respects, everyone of you have dismissed compassion, consideration & humanity from your core values. Americans have lost their moral compass directions during this election campaign. I hope that our next POTUS give (at least half) you the peace you so desire. Our children are watching all of you & they are our future, so step back and watch them mimic you & see if you like it
14 | Liberty Never Sleeps | 33 | 10155567512811509_10155567522576509 | Unfortunate. Basically one of two people will become our new president. One is a capitalist, the other is a socialist. I'm voting for the capitalist. That's it. Yell about all that other crap on both of them all you want, but I think that sums it up for me.
15 | Gino Montagna | 21 | 10155567512811509_1250136951699128 | Remember when Hillary was late coming back from the bathroom at one of the debates? Oh I forgot the Clinton news network doesn't talk ill of the queen.
16 | Bobbi Danielle Evans | 18 | 10155567512811509_1250150105031146 | So proud of Donald trump. He is showing America how hard he is going to fight for us. Hillary has everyone doing the work for her. I am / embarrassed to say that I voted for Obama, when he should be working for America but out campaigning for Hillary non stop. I have never seen a president push so hard for a candidate because he doesn't want his fail policies to define him.
17 | Sandy Velikonja | 21 | 10155567512811509_10155567527831509 | He is above God and can do what he wants. It is a shame he ended up the GOP candidate. No respect. When the 4 past presidents who are still alive, declare they are not voting for him and TWO are Republican that shows how unfit he is for this job. It really has been a circus for the Republican Party this year. Reagan is turning in his grave. I am all for the Republican Party governing your beautiful and already great country, just not this time.
18 | Tammy Lynn Andrews | 15 | 10155567512811509_931367586964457 | Oh for heaven sake's. The man is running all across this country! That is ridiculous to say you're not going to vote for him because he was late! Must be a Clinton supporter in the first place
19 | Krystian Kris | 9 | 10155567512811509_10155567581431509 | CNN - masonic propaganda. Don't You people know that Anerican jews and banks already made z choice who will be next president of US? All of You just waste time going vote , they make circus and make you think that you make a choice - No you don't choice is all made already. Clinton family is all corrupted and are responsible for so much suffer around world among with Your muppet muslim president obama that supports isis. Can't belive how naive You all are. Wish you all good luck- you will need a lot of it!
20 | Daniel Sq Ochieng | 16 | 10155567512811509_10155567533011509 | A trump suppoter asked me why am pokin ma nose in americas elections yet i aint an american...what??America pokes his nose virtually in every country in the world including mine
21 | Jimmy Brian | 5 | 10155567512811509_1250186195027537 | Thank you Donald Trump for taking the time out of your life to try and help the American people get out from under the thumb of the corrupt political elite that think they are above the law. The ones that are only interested in their own agendas and not what's best for this country or it's fellow Americans. The elite that think it's ok to lie to the people and double cross them. To cause the harm by not protecting them from foreign and domestic threats alike. Thank you for your sacrifices that you made to try and ensure that we as a people get a fair and just government.      The problem is , the people of America are so used to lying, cheating, stealing, murdering, and attacking our religion and our constitution, that we see it as the norm. You have a battle on your hands and even though these corrupt individuals and their personal interests have drug your name through the mud with lies and bribery, you still haven't quit on us. I'm sorry that so many fail to see the big picture of just how great we could be again. After this is all over, win or lose, i would like to shake your hand for giving us a shot at a true free America once again.                 Sincerely, Jimmy.
22 | Glenna White Mills | 5 | 10155567512811509_699859183499169 | I've worked in medical for 12 yrs . One thing patients hate is the doctors running late . The waiting room is full of ticked off patients . But what they don't hear is what is going on in the exam room .  I had a lady upset because her son had a test in an hour . Little did she know the doctor had just told another family their daughter had leukemia . Because of Hippa laws I could not say a word . Trump has thousands at his rallies and he does get distracted by "listening to the people " that's not a bad thing . For those on the other end waiting to see him as well have their frustrations built up when they don't understand the reasoning in his lateness . He's never been a politician this is all new for him . He loves America and her people . It's not like he's out for drinks and pizza entertaining his campaign crew.  Thousands want to be heard and if they can get a moment to catch his attention  they are going to try . She wasn't going to vote for him anyway .. reality is if people are voting like  this , no wonder  we are in a mess that we are in today.
23 | Erika Torres | 4 | 10155567512811509_931382116963004 | So why call her a traitor?GeezEveryone is entitled to their own opinion and vote.Bahahaha I can see it now, IF Trumps is prez, him and his supporters are going to call for every Hillary voter to stand trail for Treason.Bahahahaha yeah cuz that's how Trump and his Trumpets think.
24 | Karie L. Kennedy | 6 | 10155567512811509_721513441339740 | Lmao- how is that news?? I guess everyone has forgotten how notoriously late Bill Clinton (who I actually used to be a huge fan of to the point of attending 3 rallies) was ALL the time! Planes are late, cars get stuck in traffic, and yes, people even talk too long.Welcome to reality.
