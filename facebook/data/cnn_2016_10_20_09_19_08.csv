2 | Diana Flier | 10155487384221509_10155487396326509 | All of this impeccable order and beauty of the universe and cosmos did not come just by itself; of its own.

MISTAKE!(2)	As Secretary of State, Hillary, failed to provide ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù security at the Benghazi consulate, which led to the death of our US Ambassador and other Americans.  MISTAKE!(3)	Hillary Clinton has developed the reputation of a World Class lair.  MISTAKE!(4)	Hillary Clinton voted for the Iraq war.   MISTAKE!(5)	Hillary Clinton spoke favorably in the 1990s and in the early 2000s of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) signed by President Bill Clinton.  MISTAKE!(6)	Hillary Clintons Libya strategy for democracy failed big time! MISTAKE!(7)	Hillary Clinton gave Russia a reset button that reset the Cold War. MISTAKE!(8)	Hillary Clinton was clueless that the withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq would give ISIS a foothold to flourish.  MISTAKE!(9)	Hillary Clinton, along with her husband created the Clinton Foundation which has taken hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign countries while Hillary was Secretary of state. MISTAKE!(10)	Hillary Clinton has stated she will continue the failed polices of Obama.  MISTAKE!

Van Jones quotes LL Cool J to describe Donald J. Trump's debate performance: "I'm gonna have to go all the way back to old school hip hop... He lied about the lies that he lied about." http://cnn.it/2e9supV
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | David Lee Brantley | 10155487237506509_10155487251591509 | It's good that CNN doesn't even try to show neutrality anymore. Your liberal bias is out in the open for all to see. Keep propping up the criminal Clinton. This isn't even a news source anymore.
2 | Jon Shearman | 10155487237506509_10155487242681509 | Trump is a 3rd grader with the mentality of a toddler.The GOP had viable options and chose him. Trump is the end of the GOP.
3 | Gainlar Reyes | 10155487237506509_10155487252276509 | Goodluck America. I am from SEA, i watched all the debates and such. I think Clinton is a dangerous woman. You may hate Trump for all his atrocities but he might be the U.S lifesaver.
4 | Charity Alewine Murphy | 10155487237506509_10155487252911509 | I'd like for CNN to report on the dead people registered to vote in Virginia and tell me the election isnt rigged!!!
5 | Jerry Brown | 10155487237506509_10155487253306509 | CNN you are a hot mess.. First you round up Eminem then you round up quotes of LL Cool J... Who's next the Wu-Tang Clang? This is what you call media proproganda production with concerted efforts to manipulate the elections. We know whats really going on with mutual distractions with the majority of the evidence you call conspiracy turning out to be true. Hillary cheated and CNN facilitates the movement of her criminalistic achievements!
6 | Julie Bursic | 10155487237506509_10155487247596509 | Six things I learned about HRC during the debate last night:1)	HRC is too ‚Äúrobotic‚Äù:  I can‚Äôt vote for someone who seems to suffer from a ‚Äúrobotic personality disorder‚Äù and tends to react to everything in a programmed manner and like a Robot.2)	HRC is not a champion of children:  I can‚Äôt vote for anyone who claims to be a ‚Äúchampion of children‚Äù and in the next breath says she supports late term partial-birth abortion up to and including last day of pregnancy. The basic idea behind the procedure is to remove the fetus partially from the womb, where it is most commonly killed by puncturing the skull with scissors or a similar implement.3)	HRC does not have LGBT‚Äôs best interest at heart:  I can‚Äôt vote for anyone who pretends to supporter my brothers and sisters in the LGBT yet takes millions of dollars from countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc., for her so called ‚Äúcharity‚Äù.  In these countries homosexuality can be punished by death.4)	HRC wants to put ultra-liberal judges on Supreme Court:  I can‚Äôt vote for anyone who wants to appoint judges that support abortion. ‚ÄúFor me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women‚Äôs rights,‚Äù Clinton said about abortion. To her an unborn child‚Äôs life means nothing. To her ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs rights‚Äù means nothing since she has accepted millions from countries that place very little value on female rights.5)	HRC wants to shoot the messenger and not look at the truth of the message:  I can‚Äôt vote for anyone who thinks the truth is not important.  Think what you will of the WikiLeaks ‚Ä¶they did bring many truths as to HRC‚Äôs views to light. Her dual personality was exposed.6)	HRC will go to any lengths to win and at all cost:  I can‚Äôt vote for anyone who would encourage and not condemn (follow the money trail and it leads you right back to the campaign/HRC and the DNC), as documented in the O‚ÄôKeefe videos, violence and fraud as it pertains to our elections.  In the released video‚Äôs released by Project Veritas, O‚ÄôKeefe exposes what we all have known to be true and that there is a lot of corruption and voter fraud going on.
7 | Ed DeBoskey | 10155487237506509_10155487243341509 | Clinton News Network. What do you expect. Get over it. They all lie! Christ! You would think this is something new. Hillary is by far the biggest friggin liar. I will take locker room talk over turning your head while Americans pleading for their lives die. All of a sudden everybody is carrying bibles under their arms. Friggin hypocrites!
8 | Rob Feind | 10155487237506509_10155487246446509 | Every single word out of that orange racist pigs mouth is a lie...They prove he is lying with video after video, has NO plan on anything ( well, except how to sexually assault women ), and his supporters say he "won"....So happy Hillary will be our next president of the United States, and Donald can go compete on Dancing with the stars, and when he looses, he can cry it's rigged.
9 | Danny Angelsberg | 10155487237506509_10155487256081509 | It's really sad when CNN only focuses on one statement that Trump made about him accepting election results, or not!!!! Al Gore didn't until he lost his lawsuit, which held up the certifying of the votes and also disqualified thousands of votes. Remember the hanging chad???
10 | Quran Norris | 10155487237506509_10155487252901509 | Trump and Hilary are equally as terrible. Why should I be relieved that we get one or the other? It's a shame that we have two unfit candidates who've pretty much turned the country against each other.
11 | Roberta Jean | 10155487237506509_10155487263846509 | Oct. 24, 1999Trump appeared on NBC in an interview with Tim Russert. In a clip that has received newfound life during this election cycle, Trump defends his broadly liberal positions by explaining that he grew up in Manhattan, not Iowa.Asked about abortion, he‚Äôs clear.‚ÄúI‚Äôm very pro-choice,‚Äù Trump says. ‚ÄúI hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject. But you still ‚Äî I just believe in choice.‚ÄùRussert clarifies his original point: Would you ban partial-birth abortion? ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Trump replies.
12 | William Wiseman | 10155487237506509_10155487263896509 | our national security had been compromised once again by CLINTON so now the world knows that it will take 4 minutes to launch a nuclear war head
13 | Joseph Matthews | 10155487237506509_10155487284231509 | I know that CNN and other government-run media have to find a negative to report about Donald Trump at the conclusion of the debate to overshadow the fact that he continued to expose her corrupt, pathologically immoral actions and ineffective policy proposals, so that doesn't surprise me. Most average voters could care less what he said about whether he would accept the results or not. I don't think most people much understood the question or the answer. I mean, what's he going to do if he doesn't accept the results, march down the street bearing muskets and rifles. It's obvious CNN and other networks will do everything in their power to get Mrs. Clinton into the White House, though it's hard to understand why. Perhaps they fear it would cut into their cozy relationship with the establishment inside the Beltway or it would mean they couldn't cut corners in paying taxes. There has to be some reason because she offers nothing but lies, scandals and was an absolutely horrendous secretary of state who accomplished nothing other than flying around a lot and put the country in danger through her use of a private server.
14 | Adenoor Mohamed | 10155487237506509_10155487251176509 | America the biggest terrorist organisation in the world arguing about who is to be the less terrorist.I think Hillary is better though she also kills and feed on blood of innocents.
15 | William Calabrese | 10155487237506509_10155487259661509 | Trump mentioned a video. I watched it after the debate. The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. Hillary blamed Trump for the violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country. The video is higher quality, real people boasting about committing crimes and their criminal network, with names, titles and ties. Watch it if you doubt it, it has gone viral on youtube.
16 | Harvey Harv | 10155487237506509_10155487340996509 | Van Jones refuses to talk about Hillary's lies on top of lies though! He isn't a journalist because he doesn't put his feelings aside and report facts on both sides! A journalist isn't suppose to be so bias!! That's the problem with the media across this country! Put and everyday American on your panel because the reporters you have on stage don't have a clue
17 | Christopher Jensen | 10155487237506509_10155487274666509 | Van jones  is not a credible source when it comes to giving his media input on things. He is like the Stephon A smith of politics. It is his opinions not facts.
18 | Nancy Felter | 10155487237506509_10155487311511509 | CNN is the media that lies. They are conditioning people's minds for Hillary / Soros takeover. There are reasons for this. Don't allow them to do this. Donald Trump is standing up to them and you will see who is telling the truth and who is not. Seriously, is Hillary fit to be in commander in chief? Our country doesn't need any more shady dealings and corruption. Change the channel. CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC have lost their credibility by reporting biased political news with lies and slander against Donald Trump to face or and sway people to vote for Hillary. Not all Americans are so poorly educated they can't see what is happening or know when they are being lied to.
19 | Thelma Helder | 10155487237506509_10155487376591509 | Van Jones you are not a Journalist you are nothing but a POS and that's for every story you do. So from now until the election we have to here about the last question asked, there is more to discuss from this debate abortion, funds for Haiti just a few.
20 | Michael Savino | 10155487237506509_1107577355964131 | Reporter: Mr. Trump - why are you running for president?DT: All my life everyone has told me I'm the most eclectic person they've ever met. Most eclectic. I won all the eclectorial votes of the GOP and after the eclection I'll be voted the most eclectic person ever. I'll have more eclectorial votes than anyone else.
21 | Valarie Crawford-Turral | 10155487237506509_10155487278766509 | The woman sitting by Van always interrupts when someone is talking then she yells like that will make her comments true she is a true trump supporter . I haven't heard a plan yet on how trump will make America great, can't wait until this is over and I pray I don't have to listen or see her again
22 | Eudou Eliacin | 10155487237506509_10155487253226509 | Republicans; you realize if Donald Trump or someone like him without the extra baggage(misogynist, racist,immoral) you guys would have won the presidency. People are so fed up with Washington and are looking for change (outsider).A candidate with some decency and a character would be beating Haliry right now. And I lean center-left politically, saying that.
23 | Bonnie Mattila | 10155487237506509_10155487280371509 | I think cnn is biased and favors Hillary.  You should be focused on the issues.  Like immigration tax reform, jobs, heroine epidemic.  Not whether they shook hands or not.  Or whether or not he will accept the outcome of the election. That has nothing to do with his agenda for this country.
24 | Heather Lynn Maxwell | 10155487237506509_10155487276056509 | Is there something you're not telling us CNN??? Like you know, maybe it is actually rigged because you didn't even bother to ask Clinton the same thing. As if Clinton already won the election.
25 | Peter McCann | 10155487237506509_10155487270671509 | CNN is clearly a Leftist Propaganda outlet. Been watching all morning. They refuse to discuss the Wikileaks bombshell info, which implicates the serious corruption of the Left, and their dishonest collusion with media like CNN. They have latched onto an insignificant sound bite, misrepresented it, and talked it up all morning. The only othersubject has been their polling of Clinton supporters who naturally say she won. The bias to mislead people into believing Trump has already lost is embarrassing to watch. If you want to get real news on DNC corruption, you'll have to turn to Fox.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Randy Bragg | 10155487149741509_10155487163131509 | Hey CNN, what's it feel like to have less credibility than infowars???
2 | Patrick Henry | 10155487149741509_10155487208236509 | CONTRASTS THAT MATTER: That's bad what may have happened to the cats, and what's infinitely worse is Democrat politicians and their voters have tortured and murdered over 60 million children and sold many of their body parts for "progress" since they got their way with Roe vs. Wade. If you vote Democrat you have blood drenched hands, and you will have to answer for your child murder on judgment day! Please repent, your/the end is near!
3 | Dave Cook | 10155487149741509_10155487155726509 | Schrodingers storage locker. If they didn't open it, they'd still be alive.
4 | Starrygirl Starrycat | 10155487149741509_10155487373796509 | This no laughing matter or an issue related to politics. Shame on you, if you take it that way. It shows again the lack of humanity and dignity to other living creatures. Makes me very angry.
5 | Matt Scott | 10155487149741509_10155487180291509 | Am I the only one waiting for someone to call it a Chinese restaurant meat locker?
6 | Mike Ikeda | 10155487149741509_10155487255581509 | After the debate all CNN can focus on is that Trump may not accept the results. CNN is manipulating the public because they want Clinton to win. It is so obvious but the American public just cannot see what is being done to them. This what happens when Las Vegas and Disney is considered culture. Hillary Clinton is simply the worst person you could elect. Trump is second worst but still better. Do you all really want 4 or 8 more years of the same? More war? More shrinking of the middle class? More police violence? More Wall Street bailouts? Clinton is corrupt to the bone. Just do your homework.
7 | Carlo Garza | 10155487149741509_10155487155671509 | I'm sick and tired of those who say Hillary has no great accomplishments. I would say staying out of prison for the crimes she committed in the last four decades is an great accomplishment.
8 | Thomas John Gordon | 10155487149741509_10155487215991509 | Only a Hillary Supporter would freeze that many cats.
9 | Christian James Gregory | 10155487149741509_10155487156411509 | Wow... I JUST watched a South Korean horror movie about dead cats. Umm....
10 | Matthew Kennedy | 10155487149741509_10155487285126509 | I would love to find a person but the cats and their..... I guarantee you they never take another breath
11 | Chris Townshend | 10155487149741509_10155487276441509 | Guess we know what trump does after he grabs the pussy.. he freezes them
12 | Carlos Andres Moya | 10155487149741509_10155487218446509 | Donate to the nearest Chinese restaurant lol sorry I had to.
13 | Glenn Jones | 10155487149741509_10155487183451509 | Possibly old cadavers? They used to use them as cadavers in medical/vet and science programs.
14 | Peter McCann | 10155487149741509_10155487309026509 | Wait...where's the anti-Trump angle? Soros says: Too much fluff! Get back to getting Clinton elected!

18 | Wayne Hummel | 10155487149741509_10155487397196509 | lol you had to go and let that pro lifer "cat outta the bag"

22 | Donald Nelson | 10155487149741509_10155487181006509 | That storage locker was owned by Alf before he went back to Melmak.
23 | Erik Rouwenhorst | 10155487149741509_10155487154736509 | CNN........TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP!!! 24/7, PLEASE STOP!!!!
24 | Tiffany Hathaway | 10155487149741509_10155487325156509 | I care very much for women's rights - IF any allegations of Trump kissing a female are even true, that is an unfortunate and unpleasant situation for a woman. When Clinton lead the destabilisation of Syria, she forced tens of thousands of young Syrian girls into sexual slavery either under ISIS (who she created) or in the refugee camps. Let's get serious people - Trump is a clown but he is for American isolationism and peace building. Clinton is a ruthless, Machiavellian neocon monster and killer. A Serbian girl just took a picture with Madeleine Albright (Lucifer) at a Clinton rally in Ohio. I find Donald Trump repulsive but Hilary Clinton is dangerous for the world - she's a calculated monster. I encourage all my friends across America to vote for Trump, not because he's the ideal candidate but because his opponent could start WWIII and is a corporate tool. Vote with logic rather than emotion.
25 | Linda White | 10155487149741509_10155487252261509 | FCC INVOLVED now---HILLARY camp caught on tape----O'KEEFE shows the SCAM camp. look it up folks<<<<<<

1 | Nicola Stefaniak | 10155487031296509_10155487037961509 | I wonder what the sentence would be like if this little poor girl was this so- called judge family. Rapists shoud be sentenced to death.
2 | Lacey Moore | 10155487031296509_10155487036696509 | Obviously that judge is okay with raping a 12 year old.  I think child services needs to look into his past.
3 | Lauren Spencer | 10155487031296509_10155487042856509 | Put the wife in jail too. If that were my daughter and husband, i'd be a widow. "He needs help," she wrote the court. "He has two sons that still love him and need their father in their lives, even with very understandable restrictions. I would like to see my children have an opportunity to heal the relationship with their father. Please give him the opportunity to work on fixing the relationships he destroyed. He is not a monster, just a man that really screwed up and has been paying in many ways."
4 | Jairo Jair Ramirez | 10155487031296509_10155487034946509 | We cannot repeat a Brock Turner situation. This judge has to be terminated!!
5 | Aubrey Anne Patricia Williams | 10155487031296509_10155487097971509 | Are you flipping kidding me? Not only did he rape a kid but the kid he raped was his OWN DAUGHTER! Yeah his sons need a father but so did his daughter. And I'm sorry but the wife defending his actions is disgusting as well..
6 | Laurie Shannon | 10155487031296509_10155487082836509 | I can't believe this girls Mother and Grandmother are putting her brothers well being above her own. Heartbreaking and traumatizing all over again. It was up to this judge to say that their daughter deserved to grow up without contact with her rapist.
7 | –ê–Ω–Ω–∞ –í–∏–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –§–∞—Ä–∏–∞—Å | 10155487031296509_10155487034256509 | I bet he wouldn't feel the same if it was his daughter.
8 | Svetlana Sve≈•a Andr√°≈°ov√° | 10155487031296509_10155487037536509 | maybe he¬¥s done the same... who knows, how many of these monsters are in disguise as honorable people
9 | India Deshay Wylie | 10155487031296509_10155487088106509 | If he were my husband, he would be missing on day 61. His feet wouldn't even hit the pavement upon release. No worries, "judge". I would serve justice for you since you can't do your job. You have to wonder how some of these judges sleep at night. If I were the judge's wife I would side eye everything he did too. How can a person justify this?!?
10 | Kayleigh Curtis | 10155487031296509_10155487200836509 | So the loophole was that "the man, who pleaded guilty over the summer to a felony count of incest" rather than be charged for child sexual abuse? That poor girl. I hope she gets the hell out of there. It's so disheartening that no one spoke on her behalf and that the mother and grandmother were more concerned with the victim's brothers having their relationship with their rapist father rather than the rapist actually being punished for what he did to the victim.
11 | Meghan Margret | 10155487031296509_10155487119876509 | You know who's devastated? The 12 year old little girl who's own father raped her multiple times! He shouldn't be around ANY children ever again. It's not a mistake, he's not a good man. This poor little girl had no one but the prosecutor fighting for her father to be punished. #automaticpublichangingtoallchildmolesters
12 | Marti Clevenger | 10155487031296509_10155487109976509 | Sounds like he was abusive to all the women in that family and it's gotten to the point that they will defend him no matter what he does. That girl will end up the same way being in that family , thinking abuse is okay, and the boys will end up just like their father, being abusers. I hope cps gets involved after hearing these statements and more charges is brought against all the adults in this family. They may not have physical signs of abuse but they have been mentally, verbally, and emotionally abused.
13 | Aaron Pogroski | 10155487031296509_10155487085296509 | Totally discusting I got 90 days in jail for shoplifting years back how he can get less time then crimes that didn't harm or hurt anyone is discusting I did my time for my crime and this guy basicly walked off Scott free because 60 days is nothing
14 | Karen Lackie Fisher | 10155487031296509_10155487218081509 | This is horrendous! What MOTHER wants someone who RAPED their daughter to be a part of the other children's lives? That woman needs to go to jail! He needs to go to jail and have the key thrown away! That poor little girl will suffer for the rest of her life because of this. Those boys will also suffer knowing what their father has done. What is the matter with people? There is NOT A CHANCE that I would let him back in his children's lives! And the judge gives in because of the things I have read in this article! Sex offenders are very rarely successfully rehabilitated! These people are all sick. I am thoroughly disgusted about this. That little girl needs to be protected from this creep and her mother for letting this happen. My thoughts and prayers are with the little girl and her brothers. They are the ones who will truly suffer...with a mother like that üò°
15 | Michelle Light | 10155487031296509_10155487109346509 | Who are these insane people?!? And why bother protecting this man's privacy? The mother and grandmother begged for leniency to boot? And why is he considered at low risk to reoffend?? None of this makes sense. That poor girl. üò£ She needs a new family to love and protect her from these monsters.
16 | Jc Cesanek | 10155487031296509_10155487094706509 | as angry as i am at this, judge, everyone failed this little girl, the mother and grandmother both spoke for the 'father' and not her, saying he made a horrible mistake and was low risk to do it again, what the hell is that based on? even if he never did it again, he did do it and needs to be put in jail, i also blame the judicial system because in all states they try to have as few non violent criminals put in jail as possible to keep the population down, this action is also letting too many slip through the cracks
17 | Nicole Johnson | 10155487031296509_10155487184296509 | All judges who give leniency to rapist & pedophile needs to be permanently removed, and they need to investigate the judge. If he can allow these types of people to go free I'm sure he's like them in someway. It's that old saying "Birds of a feather flock together".
18 | Stephanie Deweese | 10155487031296509_10155487101201509 | I dont understand how he would be able to live back in the home. To my knowledge....sex offenders are not allowed to live in a home with children under 18. Maybe the judge made his own rules for that as well
19 | Richard Gonzalez | 10155487031296509_10155487225136509 | Wow... "A man that really screwed up...heal the relationship...give him an opportunity." The judge is the one that screwed up....the dad is an absolute monster and mom and grandma are effing delusional. It's Brock Turner all over again and the one that needs the most help can't defend herself. I hope child protective services steps in and takes all the kids away from these people.
20 | Leah St Charles | 10155487031296509_10155487219956509 | That's absolutely appalling 60 days and probation for repeatedly raping his own 12 year old? This is everything that is wrong with our Justice system. That little girl will have to bare the emotional scars of this abuse for the rest of her life. She probably has physical scars from a grown man having his way with her too. It's just gross! The mom is sickening too! Defending her husband and advocating that he get a light sentence so he can be with their sons. What? So he can teach them it's ok to victimize women! She should go to any cost to protect her child! If I were in these circumstances it would take everything I have not to murder him myself, but there's no way in earth I would advocate for anything but locking him away for good so he can't hurt anyone else!! As far as being a case that has low probability to repeat his behavior, first of all he didn't do it just once and second of all sex offenders are the most likely to re-offend! It boils my blood that our Justice system is set up to fail the most innocent and precious of our community, our children! It's disgusting and sickening!!! Things need to change and this man should be removed from the court.
21 | Christie Collins Richardson | 10155487031296509_10155487220696509 | He got away with it he will repeat it, over and over again, it is a cycle. Child molestation is a cycle that doesn't get better with treatment and now the law hasn't protected this child nor has her family. God be with her I truly hope someone steps up and gets her help because her innocence has been stripped from her by him and her family she will have trust issues with the law and always feel betrayed by her family.
22 | Ashley Miller Lanier | 10155487031296509_10155487111041509 | This is insane and so disheartening. What kind of message does this send that the only punishment for raping your daughter is a few days in jail and suspended sentences so the dad can repair relationships with his sons? Wow what does that tell you about the value given to the daughter? This is not ok. It's rape. It is not acceptable to rape your daughter and get a slap on the hand. This judge has no business being in his position if he is going to hand down sentences like this. It doesn't matter if the guy isn't going to do it again, he is to be punished for doing it in the past. Ridiculous!
23 | Gabe Geib | 10155487031296509_10155487192866509 | Yet millions of people are in prison, some for life, for marijuana. Where are our priorities? Many systems are broke in this country. Mainly the electoral college and the justice system
24 | Wendy Fraser | 10155487031296509_10155487137016509 | What is wrong with the mother & grandmother....sticking up for him....why would the sons want a dad that did that to their sister in the their lives....that poor girl ...I hope she recovers from being in this family ...i wonder if the judge would feel the same way if a rapist did that to someone he knows...the whole thing is horrific
25 | Omayra Medina | 10155487031296509_10155487118891509 | This makes me sick to my stomach. Nobody spoke about what he has done to this child. Nobody stood up for her. Not even her own family. What kind of message are we  sending a person can rape their own child call it a mistake and keep on living like nothing happens. What kind of mother prefer s her husband as to her daughter.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no quote. You‚Äôre not gonna find a quote from me,‚Äù Donald J. Trump told Hillary Clinton. Well, we found a few.

Watch 4 of Trump's statements from the debate stage that don't seem to match up with what he previously said http://cnn.it/2ewHmN0
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Odonnell Sanders | 10155486949341509_10155486966671509 | I've never seen or heard of a sore loser crying like a baby BEFORE the competition. If he believes the election is rigged, why participate and if his supporters believe its rigged, why vote?
2 | Kelvin Hayden | 10155486949341509_10155486969141509 | I notice on CNN News that they should comic cartoon characters of Donald Trump but not of Hilary Clinton. So much for equality of reporting!
3 | Dorene Frey Kranik | 10155486949341509_10155487001356509 | CNN is so bias,constantly trying to trash Trump,I never seen so much favoritism toward a candidate in my life.. CNN you're as crooked as Killary !!!
4 | Tanya Waddell Proffitt | 10155486949341509_10155486979821509 | Obama and Hilary are crooked!!! She never denied the tape. That man had been at the Whitehouse  300 times!!! Shows you Obama was paying people to stop the Trump rally's. Probably using taxpayer money too!!!
5 | Franklyn Nedu Osere | 10155486949341509_10155486961431509 | I care very much for women's rights - when Trump forcibly kisses a female, that is an unpleasant situation for a woman. When Clinton lead the destabilisation of Syria, she forced tens of thousands of young Syrian girls into sexual slavery either under ISIS (who she created) or in the refugee camps. Let's get serious people - Trump is a clown but he is for American isolationism and peace building. Clinton is a ruthless, Machiavellian neocon monster and killer. A Serbian girl just took a picture with Madeleine Albright (Lucifer) at a Clinton rally in Ohio. I find Donald Trump repulsive but Hilary Clinton is dangerous for the world - she's a calculated monster. I encourage all my friends across America to vote for Trump, not because he's the ideal candidate but because his opponent could start WWIII and is a corporate tool. By the way #CNN I hope you get shut down once Trump wins! If the war starts it's because of you! You don't care about anything just to piss the world üåé. -Filip Filipi
6 | Julie Bursic | 10155486949341509_10155486962016509 | Six things I learned about HRC during the debate last night:1)	HRC is too ‚Äúrobotic‚Äù:  I can‚Äôt vote for someone who seems to suffer from a ‚Äúrobotic personality disorder‚Äù and tends to react to everything in a programmed manner and like a Robot.2)	HRC is not a champion of children:  I can‚Äôt vote for anyone who claims to be a ‚Äúchampion of children‚Äù and in the next breath says she supports late term partial-birth abortion up to and including last day of pregnancy. The basic idea behind the procedure is to remove the fetus partially from the womb, where it is most commonly killed by puncturing the skull with scissors or a similar implement.3)	HRC does not have LGBT‚Äôs best interest at heart:  I can‚Äôt vote for anyone who pretends to supporter of my brothers and sisters in the LGBT yet takes millions of dollars from countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc., for her so called ‚Äúcharity‚Äù.  In these countries homosexuality can be punished by death.4)	HRC wants to put ultra-liberal judges on Supreme Court:  I can‚Äôt vote for anyone who wants to appoint judges that support abortion. ‚ÄúFor me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women‚Äôs rights,‚Äù Clinton said about abortion. To her an unborn child‚Äôs life means nothing. To her ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs rights‚Äù means nothing since she has accepted millions from countries that place very little value on female rights.5)	HRC wants to shoot the messenger and not look at the truth of the message:  I can‚Äôt vote for anyone who thinks the truth is not important.  Think what you will of the WikiLeaks ‚Ä¶they did bring many truths as to HRC‚Äôs views to light. Her dual personality was exposed.6)	HRC will go to any lengths to win and at all cost:  I can‚Äôt vote for anyone who would encourage and not condemn (follow the money trail and it leads you right back to the campaign/HRC and the DNC), as documented in the O‚ÄôKeefe videos, violence and fraud as it pertains to our elections.  In the released video‚Äôs released by Project Veritas, O‚ÄôKeefe exposes what we all have known to be true and that there is a lot of corruption and voter fraud going on.
7 | Lee McAdams | 10155486949341509_10155486953976509 | Thousands of Puerto Ricans are temporarily moving to Florida (mostly in Miami area) and illegally voting there to help Hillary win. I've heard close to 10,000 already have done this prior to Nov. 8 and many still coming as we speak. This is the main reason Hillary is now ahead slightly in the polls there. All she needs is Florida and she wins. This IS Voting Fraud!
8 | Carl Kendrick | 10155486949341509_10155486992211509 | She lied and corrupted the use of time last night with use of panned and rehearsed lines that did not answer any questions--there is NO evidence it is Russia! It's all a distraction to keep folks from reading the content of the Wikileaks.  Guccifer 2.0 did the last one, and the guy she had killed in the summer was rumored to have leaked a large portion of these before she had him snuffed out- like other Hillary witnesses.She is corrupt and getting help from the corrupt obama administration and AG and that is why she is noT in jailIf she wins, do you really think we will ever know what lies and deception will be perpetrated upon us?  It will be unstoppable.Hold your nose and vote trump if that's what it takes..all distractions aside, he is still the only one that will shake the corruption tree from top to bottomForget the side show--save the country and that requires trump -SCOTUS at stake-repeal and replace Obamacare-Isis -illegal immigration and strong borders-2A-free American energy -and fixing this terrible economyDo not lose sight of the issues
9 | Sherry Collins | 10155486949341509_10155487060311509 | I'm just as tired of hearing Trump supporters say ABC and CNN are biased as I am of Trump! His supporters are just mad the things the media say about him is true. I'm not for Hillary or Trump but I would choose her to be the president over Trump any day! This election is a joke. We're screwed no matter who wins!
10 | Martim Abreu | 10155486949341509_10155486975176509 | I live in Portugal and yesterday i saw this debate, in my opinion you guys have a serious problem .. the media are totally on clinton's side, trump took her down several times... and hey i hate trump.. it's a pity that a country like the US has 2 candidates in which one is a narcisist and the other a liar... :/ Good Luck from Portugal!!!
11 | Daniel Rodriguez | 10155486949341509_10155486986686509 | Any card player knows how to spot "the tell". That clear indicator that the other player is bluffing or lieing. Trump really shows his "tell". Every time he says "...wrong..." there is clear undisputable video evidence to destroy his credibility.
12 | Odonnell Sanders | 10155486949341509_10155487024111509 | All the GOP had to do was pick someone to defeat Clinton, who they call a crook and a liar and the only person they could come up with is Trump. If the election is to be rigged it was rigged by conservatives when they picked Trump.
13 | Mack Warren | 10155486949341509_10155486973226509 | After watching the videos of  Democrats going to incite violence at Trump rallies.....and paying homeless and mental ill to attack folks....This craps not ok...Clinton should quit the race..
14 | Stacey Orshan Freedman | 10155486949341509_10155487075271509 | Does this moronic idiot know that everything he says is on tape and can be verified??? Blatantly denying every lie and disgusting thing that comes out of his mouth?? I think he's got syphilis of the brain!! He is not mentally fit to run this country!!!
15 | Luke Hargis | 10155486949341509_10155487011351509 | Watch everything Hillary says not match up with what she's said before lol there thirty years of tape and plenty of wiki leaks!! How about her camp going to incite violence at trump rallies. That's illegal just like deleting evidence Congress requested. That's deplorable!!!! Cnn your a joke of a news station!!!
16 | Barbara Liberatore Court | 10155486949341509_10155487044656509 | CNN, I don't watch your news program anymore. Started switching the channel when your reporting was so one sided during the riots and your forever stirring the pot to get everyone all riled up. Sad group of reporters you have. Media is the problem with this awful election!!!!! Your done, hope your ratings drop and bottom out!!!!
17 | Cecil Savage | 10155486949341509_1427255067288997 | And again Trump folks will blame the "media". In this case it's excellent fact checking backed up with actual video of a guy who looks and sounds remarkably like Donald Trump.
18 | Wade McGuire | 10155486949341509_10155487076886509 | At least Mr. Trump tells the truth, uncomfortable as some may be, the truth is always better than deception. Nothing the Clintons or the Obama's say is believable after so many lies and cover ups over their entire political careers.
19 | John Harrigill | 10155486949341509_10155486952946509 | How quickly we forget!  If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten.  If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
20 | Rich Coe | 10155486949341509_10155486996906509 | You have seen and heard Trump. How in the world, of all the wonderful people in the great USA, did he become a nominee for president? The Republican party must be highly embarrassed. Now be sure to go out and vote for Clinton.
21 | Willie Love | 10155486949341509_688140234676256 | Donald Trump supporters hate when CNN report on him because they bust him in everything lie he tells. But they will tune in to Fox News and love it when they report on everything bad about Hillary Clinton. We get it both candidates tell lies it's not one candidate ever that has not told some lies politicians every single day.
22 | Mike Morgan | 10155486949341509_10155486977051509 | But voter fraud isn‚Äôt Creamer‚Äôs only criminal specialty. A quick look at Wikipedia reveals that Creamer spent 5 months in federal prison back in 2006 for a ‚Äú$2.3 million bank fraud in relation to his operation of public interest groups in the 1990s.‚ÄùSo, with that kind of history, you can imagine our surprise when we discovered that a Mr. Robert Creamer showed up on the White House visitor logs 340 times beginning in 2009 when Obama took office and culminating with his latest visit in June 2016. Moreover, in 45 of those instances, Creamer was scheduled to meet with POTUS himself. Perhaps this is just two old Chicago ‚Äúcommunity organizers‚Äù hanging out?
23 | Chelsea Simpson Martinez | 10155486949341509_10155487016546509 | Of course y'all did! Because the media is as one sided as a motha. How bout y'all go dig up the proof that the Clinton Foundation actually spent and I quote, "90%" of the 30 million raised for Haiti. Because according to them, they're still waiting on it.
24 | Anders Olafson | 10155486949341509_10155487061986509 | I've gotten my whole family to stop watching CNN. You guys are so biased, Donald Trump has so much more support than you guys lead on. But that's what you guys do, try to persuade the easily persuaded. Hillary is a joke, literally.
25 | Beverly Allison | 10155486949341509_1427272533953917 | No other Republican would have called her out on the crimes she committed I'm so proud of him.  The American public needs to know what our politicians are really doing for us

2 | Steve Schoenbaechler | 10155486867006509_10155486872441509 | "Trump Jr. added that his father wanted to ensure that "all Americans, all ethnicities and backgrounds have the same opportunities to do what he's been able to do" in business."If this was true, then why stiff so many of his contractors?  Why not simply pay more to his lower employees?  He has the power to make America greater right now, without the POTUS, by doing things like this.  So, sorry, I simply don't believe this.  The man goes his entire life stiffing the businesses of hardworking people.  And, now, he wants to make it up to all of them, but only if he is POTUS?  One thing I've learned about rich people, they don't take a "step down" by having to be POTUS.
3 | Toni Schlenter | 10155486867006509_10155486869726509 | Why don't all of you Trumps just go away, move to Russia
4 | Susan Robinson | 10155486867006509_10155486886701509 | Trump has no qualifications to be our president. Hillary does. That is the main reason I am voting for her.  She is calm and level-headed. She does not espouse hatred. Her gender does not define her. Her ability to do the job is what earned my support. Stop making blanket assumptions.
5 | Melanie Hodgson | 10155486867006509_10155486892881509 | Seriously? Being President is a step down from what Trump was doing? Starring in a show, running fraudulent businesses and scamming small business owners? Hmmm I guess he's right! Being President is FAR less lucrative. This kid is a spoiled rich boy. He should keep his mouth shut cuz he isn't doing daddy any favours.
6 | Abdul Rahman | 10155486867006509_10155486874966509 | Trump and Trump Jr both are senseless idiots. If Americans vote for Trump, it means you are getting ready for an American disaster..
7 | John Nguyen | 10155486867006509_10155486902201509 | If it wasn't for nepotism this Jr Turd would be unemployed. The Presidency is the highest position in the land and the world, and it's a step down?? Just like Anderson said you can't polish turds, Snr and Jr.
8 | Mike Goldstein | 10155486867006509_10155486871036509 | I am Voting for Trump- Screw the Media, the Polls, the Establishment Republicans and Democrats. The Islamic Dictators, the Foreign Criminals, the Clinton Foundation, the left wing Celebrities. the Terrorists, the Illegal Aliens,the Pundits,the Clintons and all their Minions.I am voting for America and Americans.
9 | Miriam Summerall | 10155486867006509_10155486892186509 | Trump had a chance to say something positive about the same minorities he has been bashing this entire campaign, yet he didnt!!!!! That confirms trump isnt for all americans only the rich and whiteys
10 | Gary Basham | 10155486867006509_10155486870131509 | Here are the rape charges against Trump. He is accused of brutally raping a 13 year old. Many of you will say; it's not true, it's politically motivated, or she just wants money. Many will just say "innocent until proven guilty". After last weeks video where Trump discussed doing whatever he wants because he's a celebrity, this has merit. If your child's babysitter, teacher, coach, etc were accused of this would you still say "innocent until proven guilty"?These are the documents that were filed. It should be noted that most rape cases don't have witnesses. This case has 3 witnesses. Let's hear the excuses and blind defense of Trump...https://www.scribd.com/mobile/doc/316341058/Donald-Trump-Jeffrey-Epstein-Rape-Lawsuit-and-Affidavits
11 | Thomas Franks | 10155486867006509_10155486903261509 | Good report by Washington Post. Hillary won again. Glad to know Hillary did so well. Now it is time to wrap up this election and put it to bed. I have been following Hillary since her primary race against Obama. If you recall, Clinton got more popular votes than Obama. She has always been a serious contender and fighter. This gave her more experience. The election of President Obama was a good thing. Now it is time for the baton to be handed over to Hillary Clinton. It is time for all to come together and give Hillary trhe respect and the Presidency she deserves. I ask that we give her a resounding victory by giving her the house and the senate. So many people in our country and in our world have so much to gain in her Presidency. She is the symbol of compassion, love and hope. Let us all join her.
12 | Fara Tabrizi | 10155486867006509_10155486916171509 | Apple doesn't fall too far from the tree!!!They are all idiots and poisoned our society for the past 17 months!I wish they could have been deported or a nice big tall wall could be built around them for good "Nasty Family"!!! üëéüëéüëé‚ò†Ô∏è
13 | Bill Pollock | 10155486867006509_10155486902566509 | Not a step down but a fall down...a long walk off a short dock...dive off a cliff...his brand is done. He is the pumpkin of America...orange on the outside, hollow in his core, and discarded in the garbage after 1 night.
14 | Lee Gunter | 10155486867006509_1753474008252580 | This apple is still hanging on the tree - clinging to Donald Sr's coattails.  Apparently, Dad did us all a "favor" by running for President, and he's failing at that, too..  Please, Donald: do us a real favor and just quit. You never wanted the job - that's become glaringly obvious.
15 | Dan Burnzinsky | 10155486867006509_10155486885626509 | If people want 4 more years of the same government corruption , LIES , debt , no jobs, people shooting at cops, cities burned down , healthcare going up till you can NOT afford it , then vote for Hillary ! But don`t cry when we are attacked , illegals are stealing you`re jobs and getting better care then you . Illegals pouring into this country . Crime , murders and rape by ILLEGALS . Its what you Hillary voters want . There will NEVER be a change in our life time .
16 | Fahim Doula | 10155486867006509_10155486891416509 | Hes kidding right? Being the POTUS, running the country, influencing millions of people's lives in the US and other nations and making very important decisions that could change people's ways of life and policies and so much more...is a step down from running a simple business? He should be ashamed of himself for even thinking that...but then again, he's the son of Donald Trump.
17 | Scott Sakatch | 10155486867006509_1785412308381243 | He should have said "Unlike Hillary Clinton, who actually earned real money, my father lives on other people's money that he has no intention of paying back. That and the fees he charges people for taking their money, of course."
18 | Rochelle Parks | 10155486867006509_10155486946016509 | There was one adult in the room.His name was Mike Wallace.The other two started in a debate and ended in child like behavior.These two want a job where they will speak to the enemy.Now,you can not disagree with another American.Show our kids to shake hands and act like you where taught manners.SAD VERY SAD.
19 | Catherine Diamond Owen | 10155486867006509_1753463304920317 | The Trump family are, so into themselves and so arrogant I hope to God, that we don't have to look at them running our country. They are, so insulting to our American values.
20 | Pam Colon | 10155486867006509_10155486943866509 | Obviously you ignorant people didn't read the article he said it was a step down from running his business career, unlike Hillary who did not step down from her graft and corruption (that's what she is in the business of) when she became Secretary of State. You people really should look in the mirror the things you criticize the way you speak about people you don't even know, makes you look really small!
21 | Bill Zarek | 10155486867006509_1753465601586754 | I truly believe that Trump could care less about being President. What this whole thing has been about is merely a popularity contest for him. Several years ago at a White House event he got called out and dissed by Seth Meyers and President Obama. His whole campaign has been to prove to all Americans that they were wrong. People should love him because he is "smartest" guy in the room. Turns out after a few rocks were turned over the real Trump slithered out and he found out that not all of the people love him. Now he pouts, threatens to not abide by the vote should he lose, and probably will get to declare bankruptcy once again, due to a disaterous popularity contest. What a dork.
22 | Joseph Holloway | 10155486867006509_10155486969766509 | Some of the post on here......tell you why Texas, Utah and Arizona and maybe Georgia are competitive.......any other republican would be 10 to 20 points ahead in each running againts Hillary and all her warts.......Trump and his supporters like to brag that Trump isnt a politician so he is not politicaly correct.....and that is fine....until you need to be a politician to win.......good politicians no what to say.....but more importantly......what not to say......Reagan was a politician who had the good sence to know you had to win the election first.....before you go controversial!! The other way only gets the nomination....Barry Goldwater has already proved this........Ironically......Trump will lose this election because of the very thing he is most proud of..........he is not a politician.......
23 | GloriaAnn McDuff | 10155486867006509_10155486931361509 | Unlike Hillary Clinton ‚Äï who‚Äôs gotten very rich being a politician, peddling American influence ‚Äï he hasn‚Äôt,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt only a step down, but he wants to make sure that all Americans, all ethnicities and backgrounds, have the same opportunities to do what he‚Äôs been able to do, to start a great family, start a great business.‚Äù
24 | Wade Crystal | 10155486867006509_1753488081584506 | Of the two candidates running for president...Only Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress.Only Hillary Clinton was fired from a job for being unethical.Only Hillary Clinton deleted 30 some thousand emails after she was ordered to hand them over to the Fed.Only Hillary Clinton had that same computer wiped clean by professionals.Only Hillary Clinton got the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughed about it.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about Benghazi.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about her emails.Only Hillary Clinton lied about being under sniper fire.Only Hillary Clinton lied about lying to the American people.Only Hillary Clinton was involved in " Cash Cow "Only Hillary Clinton has a long list of scandals.Only Hillary Clinton nationally belittled her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers.Only Hillary Clinton is a career politician.Only Hillary Clinton will not release her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banks.Only Hillary Clinton is tied to Monsanto.Only Hillary Clinton was labeled " Extremely careless " about national security by the FBI!Only Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class.Only Hillary Clinton benefited from the DNC rigging an election!Only Hillary Clinton had to return stolen items from the White House.Only Hillary Clinton said the Benghazi victims parents where lying.Only Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her based on her gender.Only Hillary Clinton has no real accomplishments after a lifetime in politics.Only Hillary Clinton has never created any jobs.Only Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI and found to have put national security at risk.Only Hillary Clinton has had two or more movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics.Only Hillary Clinton was called "Broomstick one" by the SS.Only Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would of simply told the truth in the first place ! Fact - all facts!Only Hillary Clinton regularly cussed out and belittled her SS detail.Only Hillary Clinton Only Hillary Clinton Only Hillary Clinton over and over again.But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump? That is insane!I will never understand how any moral person in good consciencecould vote for this woman.(This is just a small percentage of a much longer list)
25 | Neena Gould | 10155486867006509_1742962545964039 | Trump knows what a business needs to thrive. Trump can use that by making changes in our laws, taxes, etc. to open it up for other companies. Trump moved his companies out of America for a reason. It's what was best for business. Donald knows what is necessary to have a thriving business in America. He knows what needs to be changed to bring his own companies back home. If he can open it up to where he can intelligently bring his business back it opens it up for the rest.

Miss Wednesday night's #debate? With the election weeks away, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump got into it one last time. Here's a recap in 90 seconds http://cnn.it/2e8mq0E
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Todd Sam | 10155486787881509_10155486797706509 | Trump in a landslide !!!!  Typical democratic union auto workers in Michigan voting Trump to save their jobs!!! CNN isn't reporting this.
2 | Bonita Linda | 10155486787881509_10155486805596509 | TRUMP WON.... Trump detailed how he was going to bring and create jobs.. Clinton talked an outcome with no plan... She's feeding the world what we want to hear but with no plan to back it up...
3 | Sandra Krynski | 10155486787881509_10155486821586509 | Do people really buy this bullshtt? If you actually watched the debate and then watched this recap, even as a Hillary supporter you have to admit how corrupt CNN is....
4 | Ren DV | 10155486787881509_10155486795486509 | It was really saddening to see how the media at once claimed Hillary won the debate through a poll, when in fact it's the other way around. Just one point.. when Trump totally denied all the allegations against on him on women while raising to Hillary the violence that she could probably be inciting, she was not able to refute it and outright deny it.. it only means that Trump must be telling the truth.
5 | Emmanuel Guillaume | 10155486787881509_10155486802526509 | This corrupted and crooked warmonger use their talent for lie and duplicity for abuse naive People ! STOP her before she start the final disaster !
6 | Gary Doan | 10155486787881509_10155486790841509 | Trump mentioned a video. I watched it after. The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. Hillary blamed Trump for the violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country.
7 | Mike Fondots | 10155486787881509_10155486824206509 | It's amazing that it is fact that the primary was 100% rigged for Hillary but yet people still think that the election could not be rigged
8 | Linda Trahan | 10155486787881509_10155486877931509 | CNN you lied again boy they must have paid you off good for you to lie to the American public like you do! No one wants Hillary to win you media clowns are hyping her up it will not happen the public wants someone stern not blinkey eyed twinkle toes. Stop lying and start sharing the truth we want Trump!!! We are the voice of America not you b/c you stopped telling the truth a long time ago. Every person I speak to says the are voting for Trump so where are you getting your survey figures from your employees? Clear your head and vote for America vote Donald Trump!
9 | Vicky Garza Solis | 10155486787881509_10155486829911509 | Trump was the Winner! She didn't deny wiki leaks, hidden camera to rig Trumps rallies, etc. she seems to be more concerned about illegals than the American people. When he called her a "nasty woman " and I don't like name calling, but he said what we were all thinking!
10 | Erico Goncalves da Cruz | 10155486787881509_10155486797971509 | At least, Trump has won a full time job at the Kremlin and he should thanks to Hillary. Trump, It is ok to lose because there is always another door open. Hillary President!
11 | Den Dow | 10155486787881509_10155486799111509 | Donald Trump proved last night that he cannot be president in today's world maybe 30 years ago he could but not in today world
12 | Marsha N David Graham | 10155486787881509_10155486866191509 | Which Hillary are you voting for?  The one who looks into the camera and Lies or the one who Lies to Congress, the FBI, and the American people?  No matter, she Lies about everything!!!!üòÄüòÖüòÜüòÇ Vote Trump for America!!üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
13 | Arjun Raj | 10155486787881509_10155486882491509 | Donald J. Trump is a brainless psycho. He didn't even answer one question properly. Such simple questions yet he answers as though it's  complicated scientific questions. The way he approaches question itself reflects who he is. This kinda moron surely can't deal with global agreements and treaties.
14 | Sherry Vogt | 10155486787881509_10155486948336509 | Pretty one sided video...you have to aee the whole debate to see how she never answered somebody the questions especially if she would send back the millions of dollars she took from Saudi Arabia and other countries....
15 | John Lesch | 10155486787881509_10155486867551509 | Get ready for a LANDSLIDE Trump victory in America, it's going to be a huge win for American sovereignty and the final death blow to Globalism (new world order).. The Majority of Americans are voting for Trump because they are sick of business as usual in Washington DC and the American people are fed up with the criminality/corruption that runs rampant in the Federal Government.. There is a Monster vote just hiding under the surface and election day it's going to be seen, so many closet Trump supporters.. Trump = American sovereignty and Hillary Clinton = Globalism (new world order)... Anyone voting for Clinton seriously needs their heads examined.. Trump is the real deal and is not a Puppet to the Globalists. That's why the Zionist mass media, both political parties and the entire Globalist establishment are attacking Trump in every direction possible... The Globalists are losing control every step of the way and the desperation is extremely obvious.
16 | Dana Duvall | 10155486787881509_10155486902756509 | Trump is the lowest intellectual nominee our country ever had.Can't imagine seeing this juvenile thug negotiating with confident intellegent sophisticated world leaders . He would be an embarrassment!!!!!!
17 | Carol A Sz | 10155486787881509_10155486824276509 | You may not like his personality , he will create what he states he will. Hillary will create more government control and more of Obama. But hey, "What difference does it make?" if she gets in it will because it is fixed. People of this country are the slaves of this evil person.
18 | Joy Diamond | 10155486787881509_10155486846146509 | So happy that it's over. Debating him is like talking to a pumpkin. Orange on the outside, hollow inside and we get to throw it out in a few weeks because it stinks. üá∫üá∏üíôüíôüíô
19 | Dan Burnzinsky | 10155486787881509_10155486886556509 | If people want 4 more years of the same government corruption , LIES , debt , no jobs, people shooting at cops, cities burned down , healthcare going up till you can NOT afford it , then vote for Hillary ! But don`t cry when we are attacked , illegals are stealing you`re jobs and getting better care then you . Illegals pouring into this country . Crime , murders and rape by ILLEGALS . Its what you Hillary voters want . There will NEVER be a change in our life time .
20 | Gordon Terry | 10155486787881509_10155487080691509 | So Trump was asked what's 2+2 and this was his answer. Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."No I did not write this, its a share of a share of share, I don't take any credit but I thought it was to hilarious that it deserved to be reshared.
21 | Chuchat Prasertkun | 10155486787881509_10155486821576509 | " Mr. Trump is the only candidate who can secure the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton, or whomever is the Democratic nominee, in order to make America great again" -Trump Campaign
22 | Adam King | 10155486787881509_10155486848376509 | Trump is the best for USA Clinton she is a liar and looking for war all media against him bcz he saying the truth when Clinton she tells lie after lie
23 | Jason Shim | 10155486787881509_10155487152721509 | Donald Trump didn't realize how he had unintentionally carried Hillary up to be a qualified President of USA. When Donald attacked & accuse & repeatedly calling Hillary nasty names & she is still cool & calm with her response. She did not over reacted at anytime even with Donald throwing everything at her. Donald she definitely has the qualities to be a President than you.
24 | Jonathan E. Lougee | 10155486787881509_10155486881896509 | So let me get this straight, 17 intelligence agencies have determined the intent of a foreign entity known as Wikileaks, but they can't determine the intent of one 501C-3 known as the clinton global initiative, their exchange of money for access, and the destruction of evidence?
25 | Melissa Marie | 10155486787881509_10155487219391509 | CNN is really getting to me- I actually watched the debate- why not put up a clip about the Wikileaks and her emails that she couldn't explain? Ridiculous. This clip is clearly one sided. Done following this nonsense.

2 | Fifa 17 IOS | 10155486661176509_10155486671781509 | The fact that Hillary is not wearing an American flag pin says it all. She is not for America. She is only for herself. If she wins, we all lose. She is a liar, criminal and a con artist. We need real change!
3 | Clouded Leopard | 10155486661176509_10155486706696509 | CNN are you paid by clintons foundation? You know that Hillary sold part of your market with uranium to Russia and got paid for that?? And what about her campaign? She paid mentally ill people to attack others at Trumps meetings? She lied and the chief of teh FBI confirmed it? YOu are just funny, cnn.
4 | Kim Keller | 10155486661176509_10155486681616509 | Well Killary is a political puppet for all her Donors .Donald is too strong willed to be ANYBODY'S puppet so she can shut the hell up .
5 | Justin Smith | 10155486661176509_10155486704856509 | We can speculate on that all day long, but one thing we already know for sure is that Hillary Clinton is Wall Street's puppet.
6 | Frank Mwax | 10155486661176509_10155486718531509 | I have had enough. We can no longer allow our businesses to be associated with the CNN brand, as such we shall no longer advertise with CNN being such a biased organization. We will NOT renew our contract with CNN come Feb 2017 #PullThePlug

8 | Will Kendall | 10155486661176509_10155486774066509 | I'm no fan of Trump, this article is quite flawed in numerous ways. First of all, Putin is not and has never been in support of Trump. Putin is very critical of Clinton, which has led him to say some nice things about Trump as well. Secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, not one of those 17 intelligence agencies has produced a shred of proof that it was the Russians that initiated the hack. They can point their finger all they want, but without any proof even their guesses are worthless. So technically, yes, Trump was right this time. We do have no idea who initiated the attacks, and Putin is "not his best friend". All things considered, however, please do not cast your ballot for the madman or the criminal. Vote third party! #LetGaryDebate #JohnsonWeld2016  #FeelTheJohnson
9 | Evert de Jong | 10155486661176509_10155486708906509 | Hillary says a lot, but mostly they are lies! why isnt she in prison? and how in the hell can she run for president? its official, USA ur a joke!
10 | Mike Frasca | 10155486661176509_10155486781051509 | Trump Putin's puppet? No Evidence. Hillary a puppet to donors of Millions and Millions when they ALL call in favors at the same time. The US will be at the mercy of those donors.
11 | Jamey Womack | 10155486661176509_10155486715771509 | I think this is one of those deals where the person is more sorry they got caught than they are about doing the deed. Don't get me wrong. I despise both of these people. But it truly burns me that she will never pay for her crimes and will be awarded the presidency  (most likely) by the people whom she has wronged most. There is no such thing as honor or justice in this nation anymore
12 | Jim Grosteffon | 10155486661176509_10155486743336509 | Trump didn't encourage anything. Hillarys emails were hacked and stolen before she started her run for president and before she permanently deleted the ones she didn't want us to see with bleachbit (after having them subpoenaed).
13 | Timothy Webb | 10155486661176509_10155486782861509 | You're a sham, CNN. But don't feel bad, you aren't the only ones. You manipulate the masses with fake news and highly rigged polls, you are controlled by rich, corrupt, cruel people who are bent on dominating the common man. People are finally waking up to the illusion that "everything is okay." It's not. You're largely to blame.
14 | Frank Shelley Shooter | 10155486661176509_10155486739351509 | Anything a Traitor says is likely to be a lie. Hilary Clinton is a traitor. There is NO reason ANY patriot would support this horror of a woman should you fools elect her to office.

16 | Jerry Scott Dockery | 10155486661176509_10155487042256509 | There was a time when people could watch fox news, msnbc, and laugh because we knew we could tune in to CNN and get a far report. Not anymore, You guys are so hell bent to help Hillary win you can't see actual news to report. I voted Democrat the last election, but not this time. Hillary Clinton is the worst candidate since Jimmy Carter. Stop making the news and just report it fair.
17 | Christi Miller | 10155486661176509_10155486774001509 | I'm confused so instead of addressing what is in the emails, she tries to blame Trump for Someone hacking these emails. Hmm about right for her. Take the focus off what matters & deny, deny deny. I'm not fond of either candidate but she is extremely dangerous for this country. She will say anything & do nothing. That's what Obama said about her in 2008. Tired of these politicians who are trained to fool & be fake. They all lie for their own personal gain. They all, including Hillary, could care less about the American people or this country. Tired of the lies & no action. Spending is out of control, taxes are ridiculous, healthcare is unaffordable & the economy is a joke.
18 | Ernest Hoskins | 10155486661176509_10155487135771509 | Love how democrats only defense against their corruption being exposed is Russia committed espionage. Lol, I for one am glad they did (if they are the ones responsible) because it proves just how much our government does not have the American people's interest at heart only their wallets. #draintheswamp
19 | James Campbell | 10155486661176509_10155486790836509 | How can you people not see that Clinton wants war with Russia !! She has insulted and accused Russia of things to cover her own negligence and corruption, even when listing allies she didn't even mention Russia as though she already considers them an enemy. She will bring about another Cold war where everyone has nuclear weapons pointed at each other with fingers on the launch keys. So vote for Hillary because you want to be "progressive" but remember when the shite hits the fan that it is absolutely your fault for putting a crazy woman in office !
20 | Josh Millican | 10155486661176509_553856174825115 | Why would she say that?  She's the only puppet on the stage.  She's been corrupt since day 1.  The minute that she fell to the ideology of Saul Alinsky, she has basically decided she would sell her soul (and anything else in her control) to the highest bidder.  That includes using criminals to cover up her criminal activities.  Donald Trump didn't encourage espionage, her problem is, she wants to paint that portrait because she can't stand the fact that the WikiLeaks exposed her and the DNC for what it is.  What's so funny is that Dinesh D'Souza got it right again.  Not only did he accurately predict Obamas last term as president (and afterwards the government jailed him for over contributing to another politicians campaign which was a cover up for exposing Obama and an effort to quiet D'Souza --  however, multiple corporations if investigated, have committed much worse crimes with Hillarys campaign, but the government turns a blind eye) he accurately depicted the DNC and Hillary Clinton's efforts.  If CNN had REAL reporters with some level of intelligence and a goal to accurately report, they would want a room full of D'Souza type individuals who want to report for the common good.  But CNN has contributed so much money to Hillarys campaign for media privilege, they push a BS liberal agenda.  Good luck with that after Novemeber 8th...
21 | Marni Segal | 10155486661176509_10155486969191509 | Actually he is his and you must not speak English but he clearly said it was wrong but you guys lost your credibility a long time ago when you as journalist started reporting half truths.  Like in Cuba the news they want you to hear not the whole story and what we need to know.  You pimped yourself all the way to tabloid town.
22 | Michelle Smith | 10155486661176509_1843241869221361 | I laughed out loud when she said this. By definition, HILLARY CLINTON committed ESPIONAGE when she used her private, unsecured email server for relaying CLASSIFIED documents!  You cannot make this up!!
23 | Jenny Stiles | 10155486661176509_10155486793731509 | No hillary it is you who should be in a very dark hole in prison for all your espionage and treasonous things you havd done to hurt this country.
24 | Mazhar Ali | 10155486661176509_10155486698866509 | well said..Putin is envy of US power and he knows well that it is almost impossible to bring US down without the help of a puppet so he supports Trump.
25 | Starla Kalb | 10155486661176509_10155487098811509 | No she is paid too much by other countries. Pay for play, which she refused to answer anything about because she would be lying or incriminating herself, makes her already a paid puppet.

JUST IN: The Schiaparelli spacecraft was lost on its fiery descent to Mars, the ESA - European Space Agency says.
--------------Comments:--------------

From the ESA ‚ÄúFollowing yesterday‚Äôs events we have an impressive orbiter around Mars ready for science and for relay support for the ExoMars rover mission in 2020,‚Äù said Jan W√∂rner, ESA‚Äôs Director General.  ‚ÄúSchiaparelli‚Äôs primary role was to test European landing technologies. Recording the data during the descent was part of that, and it is important we can learn what happened, in order to prepare for the future.‚Äù
3 | Simon Black | 10155486593766509_10155486596456509 | So tragic. My heart goes out to the astronaut's families.
4 | Bonnie Ewen | 10155486593766509_10155486793191509 | Here's a novel idea, why don't we spend those billions of dollars fixing our planet instead of pissing money away on a backup planet in case we destroy this one?
5 | Adam Rowley | 10155486593766509_10155486847936509 | This reminds us that every trip into the unknown has the potential for failure, whether it is visiting new worlds or going into a job interview. Let us learn from our failures and keep pushing on. Congrats to the ESA for what they achieved with this trip to Mars and best wishes for their next trip. The US needs good peaceful competition for space flight.
6 | Klaatu Boradanicto | 10155486593766509_10155487136486509 | The scientists and engineers who perpetrated this wasteful failure couldn't care less because the money the money wasted on it was only OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY.  Their attitude is:  "well, that's the way it goes.  But that's OK because we're still on the payroll, so let's just get back to the drawing board and start wasting another trillion dollars on trying to prove that there's life in outer space".
7 | Jerry Merryman | 10155486593766509_10155487206416509 | Funny. Especially when there's NO SUCH THING as a mars lander . I've got a telescope that can see into the Promodias Nebula. Until you can prove I dont, I guess you're stuck believing EVERYTHING I say about it.
8 | Patrick Sandoval | 10155486593766509_10155487289936509 | The Russians did it, WikiLeaks did it, no wait does the lander have a P***y? If yes, then he did it, or maybe she erased it... no matter what the reason, come on meteor, thin the herd!!!
9 | John Lesch | 10155486593766509_10155486842076509 | Get ready for a LANDSLIDE Trump victory in America, it's going to be a huge win for American sovereignty and the final death blow to Globalism (new world order).. The Majority of Americans are voting for Trump because they are sick of business as usual in Washington DC and the American people are fed up with the criminality/corruption that runs rampant in the Federal Government.. There is a Monster vote just hiding under the surface and election day it's going to be seen, so many closet Trump supporters.. Trump = American sovereignty and Hillary Clinton = Globalism (new world order)... Anyone voting for Clinton seriously needs their heads examined.. Trump is the real deal and is not a Puppet to the Globalists. That's why the Zionist mass media, both political parties and the entire Globalist establishment are attacking Trump in every direction possible... The Globalists are losing control every step of the way and the desperation is extremely obvious.
10 | Cap Chris | 10155486593766509_10155486715936509 | Oh wow thats just funny, Got all the way there, and lost it when it was entering the atmosphere rofl. Shoulda had Geico insure that!

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Grant Batdorf | 10155486519876509_10155486536286509 | He was completely right on everything he called a disaster. The biggest disaster of all was the video proving that she and her campaign incited the violence at his rallies. Perhaps using the word rigged is an oversimplification, but for Christ's sake, she's guilty if inciting riotous behavior. Vote Trump, as middle finger to the corruption in government.
2 | Vincent Forrester | 10155486519876509_10155486527641509 | The guy has multi billion dollar bankruptcies yet his army of brainwashed trailer trash morons thinks he can fix the economy lmao.
3 | Gary Doan | 10155486519876509_10155486527301509 | Trump mentioned a video. I watched it after. The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country.

6 | Emily Lazzell | 10155486519876509_10155486613946509 | The woman had lied repeatedly to everyone. FBI, American people (Benghazi... Wikileaks has an interesting email of the back and forth discussion on what to "tell" the American people) Her stance on topics flip flop according to whom she's speaking to. (Look up the BLM closed discussion with Hillary and top leaders of BLM) just one example.
7 | Shirley Jennings | 10155486519876509_10155486540581509 | How about Hillary's eye blinking, deep breaths, and leaning backward like she is almost going to pass out?  Where's the number count for that?

A total disaster.. If you ask me It is a disaster.Trumpie looks like a tired defeated candidate, Hillary looks presidential. What a disaster.
9 | Christal Gross | 10155486519876509_10155486549771509 | Trumpsters and Trump himself constantly complain about the media and how their biased. Hello Trump is constantly calling them corrupt do you blame them? If someone is constantly going around saying you are corrupt why would you support them. Every single thing Trump accuses Hillary of is just that accusations nothing proven. Now everything Trump is accused of their are witnesses and most of the time he is the one who said it.

Most eclectic. I won all the eclectorial votes of the GOP and after the eclection I'll be voted the most eclectic person ever. I'll have more eclectorial votes than anyone else.
15 | Gordon Terry | 10155486519876509_10155487078896509 | So Trump was asked what's 2+2 and this was his answer. Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."No I did not write this, its a share of a share of share, I don't take any credit but I thought it was to hilarious that it deserved to be reshared.
16 | Sara Johnson Hector | 10155486519876509_10155486540186509 | The Middle East couldn't possibly be in worse shape due to Hillary (and Obama/Kerry) being so incompetent and weak. I wish I could be a miserable failure at my job, become a millionaire, and run for president. How did this happen?
17 | Darci Wren | 10155486519876509_10155487114201509 | If Donald Trump paid people to protest and start violence and paid to get election questions before the debate CNN would be playing it over and over and over...Your a disgrace to journalism
18 | N.l. Easlick | 10155486519876509_10155486626621509 | Hillary is a known fhug criminal who hired people to start violence at Trump events and had them carry Bernie signs to blame Bernie supporters and now these doofuses support her criminal network.
19 | Pong Pong | 10155486519876509_10155486599166509 | Well this also happens in Philippines the news always pointing on duterte that he is the bad guy but, in the end duterte wins the election
20 | Paula Reeves | 10155486519876509_10155487209341509 | Hillary gave classified information telling the world that our nuclear response time is 4 minutes .Joe Biden told the world at one of the rallies that a secret service carries a briefcase so he can push the button. Less than 10% went to Haiti from the Bill,Hillary,Chelsea Clinton Foundation . Hillary calls Donald J. Trump a puppet . yet she signed off on the contract her Husband and Russian President entered into giving 20 % American uranium weakening America's credit rating . Hillary looks down on businessmen/women who take tax exemptions the laws allow . Hillary left out that she had to refile her income taxes because she left out millions and millions from foreign countries that rape/kill and enslave women,children,LGBT that support her campaign Illegal immigrants do not pay federal tax returns they do not have a social security card. Billions go back to Mexico . Hillary is a nasty politician. Her super pacs paid 1,500 w/ a phone to mental ill inciting riots that beat and terrorised Chicago Trump Supporters and bombed RNC office in NC. and it goes on and on and on #NEVERHILLARY #MAGAWhen Roe vs Wade first came out , the viability of the baby aka fetus was considered had constitutional rights . It was never meant to be in late term or if the child could survive and only if the women's health was at stake . Today medical field has extended the survival rate of the child aka fetus . It was NEVER meant to be a birth control method or to sell body parts .
21 | Eric Douglas Jr. | 10155486519876509_10155486532036509 | Serious question what does mark zuckerberg see when he looks at his bank account?? Is there even a number?? Or do they estimate how much money he has?? Also does he have a regular bank account like chase or bank of America?? I wonder sometimes if he just looks at his bank statements im sure he has an accountants but does he have access to just be at home and say hmmm maybe I should check my account
22 | Jerry Huang | 10155486519876509_10155486659371509 | Typical Trumpster argument: hillary lies emails benghazi fbi indictment flipflop clinton foundation oligarchy biased media queen shes the lying devil. Trump says everything is a disaster therefore I vote for Trump. And Trumpsters always bring up hillary whenever they defend Trump...
23 | Matt Gilbert | 10155486519876509_10155486862361509 | Obamacare sucks!! Aleppo doesn't have anything do with America! I sick and tired of taxpayers money going to country's that pull their own weight!!
24 | Roger Riskalas | 10155486519876509_10155486760626509 | People missing the point, are you looking for a clever presenter or an honest president? Who cares if he performs less in presenting if he is honest and real. Amazing this world how low level have we reached amazing
25 | Laila Saad | 10155486519876509_10155486533051509 | They put a school kid opposite to her to let her win ! If they put anyone else she would never win . Their plans is continue destroying the Middle East. She will finish what Obama started! Unfortunately

Hillary Clinton: "What we want to do is replenish the Social Security trust fund..."

Donald J. Trump: "Such a nasty woman."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Tms Virdi | 10155486463596509_10155486471001509 | Trump contradicts himself multiple times even on the stage. "Nobody respects woman like me". Followed by " She is a nasty woman"!!!! Da ... Someone please tell him it's not an reality show... ;)
2 | Vincent Forrester | 10155486463596509_10155486471566509 | This moronic buffoon is foul mouthed and has no basic civic sense.  His misogynistic attacks on her were lame, and he has no policy besides going on ad hominem attacks and gloating about himself. He just appeals to his inbred trailer trash supporters , who suffer from severe group think and cannot think for themselves but accept that garbage which comes off Fox News . It was watching an educated woman debating a 6 year old brat. Congratulations President Clinton in advance. His stupidity and ignorance is mind boggling , but more so his legions of trailer trash supporters who are mostly closeted racists/White supremacist Nationalists  and pseudo do gooder "Christians" . Don't believe me just hop on to Fox news and see the comments they openly make about the Obamas or any person of color in general, either they are "thugs " , "terrorists", or animals of some sort . It sad the Republican party which was once a polished party even more so than the Democratic one at a point has been reduced to a  cheesy closeted White nationalist party which is the reality now.
3 | Jamie Murphy | 10155486463596509_10155486476011509 | So you're okay with her giving our nuclear response time? Quit being biased. She gets in we're in war with Russia. Everyone who votes for her should go fight that war not innocent people.
4 | Ruben Orlando Vega | 10155486463596509_10155486467981509 | People don't realize that if we impose a no fly zone in Syria, we will be in direct conflict with Russia, Syria and Iran. The candidate that supports that plan is Hillary Rodham Clinton.
5 | Aleksandar Lucic | 10155486463596509_10155486471076509 | I care very much for women's rights - when Trump forcibly kisses a female, that is an unpleasant situation for a woman. When Clinton lead the destabilization of Syria, she forced tens of thousands of young Syrian girls into sexual slavery either under ISIS (who she created) or in the refugee camps. Let's get serious people - Trump is a clown but he is for American isolationism and peace building. Clinton is a ruthless, Machiavellian neocon monster and killer. A Serbian girl just took a picture with Madeleine Albright (Lucifer) at a Clinton rally in Ohio. I find Donald Trump repulsive but Hilary Clinton is dangerous for the world - she's a calculated monster. I encourage all my friends across America to vote for Trump, not because he's the ideal candidate but because his opponent could start WWIII and is a corporate tool. By the way #CNN I hope you get shut down once Trump wins! If the war starts it's because of you! You don't care about anything just to piss the world üåé. -Filip Filipi
6 | Mikal Ceegee | 10155486463596509_10155486473201509 | Which part of "mass murdering, rape enabling, con artist who stole hundreds of millions of dollars from poor Haitians while covering up her husband's dozens of rapes and ruining the lives of the victims" doesn't fall under your definition of "nasty woman", CNN?
7 | Lia Murthy | 10155486463596509_10155486477831509 | CNN....just try to hide your bias a little. US has been forcing their will on other countries to adhere to democracy and i was a strong supporter. But now, CNN you are doing what the likes of Kim Jong Il was doing, and people like Mugabe....and so on. Where are your principles oh self righteous CNN. Maybe, the god of journalism might be offended this time and karma happens, and unwind all that you've done...and Trump wins!! Lol...that would be so nice to see....(btw, i dont believe in the god of journalism, but i think karma happens eventually to people who lie....)
8 | Mariam Isaacson | 10155486463596509_10155486518016509 | CNN, you breaking the rules of impartiality by colluding with Clinton.. He called her "nasty" after she insulted him, not after she said what you wrote... Nobody takes you seriously anymore, bloody morons..!
9 | Huns Core | 10155486463596509_10155486471921509 | if HiLIARy is not nasty, why her daughter looks not like clinton but Hubbell?, if she is not nasty, why she insulted the women her husband insulted? if she is not nasty,why she deleted 33,000 emails ,if she is not nasty, why she left 4 American men dead without helping them,.........she is a liar as Obama said: she only talks but never can do ...https://youtu.be/UoE73WNoCXo
10 | Figueroa OJ | 10155486463596509_10155486466016509 | The Americans voting for Clinton are the rich elites and the people that have not read about this person, her personal agenda. They themselves will see as she will put America into a world war and other wars, place the US into a depression so that the rich elite can become richer and then it will be kings and slaves format back again with a little twist the rich elite will really have their way this time ,that is the reality. Forget the entire BS in the election on both sides. People this is simple do you want a person ready for war and promoting war for the next four years. You know rich elite will loves this system. Or do you want a man that is a bit vocal sometimes but a good business man that can really build business back in America, rebuild the country, and increase trade worldwide. And not continue creating arms deals with Saudi Arabia that is currently using US weapons and bombing Yemen killing thousands of people  were  they killed 700 children by bombing and 1000 people at a funeral the US says Saudi said it was a mistake, is this the type of person we want that promote these sales it‚Äôs called blood money. Hillary talks about women yet turn a blind eye to all the women losing their babies are those women less of a mother than the ones in the US. Is that what America stands for? Is that what the American women stands for today? Let‚Äôs be real. People don't you get it they don't even talk peace they only blame other countries and continue to bomb and kill and kill .Is this what the American people stand for today .What have you become where is your voice. It‚Äôs not my responsibility to tell you who to vote for or I will become another CNN member but I think you know the difference of evil and a person who talks a lot but mean well for this land that use to be great.
11 | Zeyad Ayed | 10155486463596509_10155486531491509 | I've never seen a vulgar person in my life ever like Trunp.I disagree with few things about Hillary but that would never let me take this pervert's side.He spent his life spoiled thinks he can get everything he wants.He was right but his money can't buy my respect for him üòèüòè
12 | Bonita Linda | 10155486463596509_10155486507886509 | She is a nasty and disrespectful woman.. Trump punched her so hard below the belt that she again purposely didn't shake his hand before and after can u just imagine if she's elected president and does this ignorance to our allies... Smhhh
13 | Erv Dundee Mayo Melgo | 10155486463596509_10155486513906509 | Trump hit her with bigger bombs than she hit him. She was not able to defend herself well. And the winning line of the night. "Putin outsmarted you and Obama every step of the way." Freaking Nailed it.
14 | Melissa Montour | 10155486463596509_10155486579136509 | You guys are taking it way out of context that's not how it was said. She threw a low blow by implying he would try to find a way out of it (like his taxes) and that's when he said it. You guys are so pro-Hilary you've lost my respect for you guys as a credible news source. Even Fox is staying neutral on their reporting lol
15 | Thomas Coyne | 10155486463596509_10155486469096509 | I see two incontrovertible qualifications for both of these candidates.1. They are both over 35 and2. They are both natural-born citizens of the USA.That is all.
16 | Gary Doan | 10155486463596509_10155486468221509 | The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country,
17 | Seane Sca Raiztlin | 10155486463596509_551955611669692 | Rearrange the quotes to fit your agenda huh, cnn has become one of the most horribly biased news stations I've ever seen, I used to think it was a good news outlet but not anymore and neither does anyone else but people who want biased stories about trump and all of hillaries illegal actions lies and wronjgdoings ignored and not reported.Because thats all that is here, he won the debate and you simply refuse to report it.Sad sad and more sad, not that its a surprise at this point.
18 | Michael Savino | 10155486463596509_10155486541191509 | Reporter: Mr. Trump - why are you running for president?DT: All my life everyone has told me I'm the most eclectic person they've ever met. Most eclectic. I won all the eclectorial votes of the GOP and after the eclection I'll be voted the most eclectic person ever. I'll have more eclectorial votes than anyone else.
19 | Seline Silverstone | 10155486463596509_10155486511166509 | Trump's supporters missed one important issue that is Women Rights. He abused too many ladies, when the tape finally released he make excuses on which there wasn't any sincere apologies. During this campaign there was no difference he said nasty woman. Clearly shows that he is not respecting women. We don't want such sex predator in White House
20 | Tony Martine | 10155486463596509_10155486521601509 | Actually she was talking about that and said the contribution of the wealthy would go up "assuming Donald can't find a way to get out of it" which is a direct shot at him, right before he responded with the "dirty woman" comment. I don't support either of these clowns but at least report it truthfully , stop trying to trick people into voting for Clinton.
21 | Rebecca Elaine | 10155486463596509_10155486500701509 | Is it presidential? No. Is it a lack of self control, sure, but people are blowing up this one line like it's something over the top vulgar. When I'm in a bad mood, my husband has told me I'm being nasty and in no way is he disrespectful. I just don't really get the big deal about this.
22 | Deshawn Branch | 10155486463596509_10155486467686509 | I hate trump but I hate Hillary too. I can't believe that Americans will vote for either one of them. You are really going to choose between a crazy man and a corrupt liar.
23 | Marlon King-Giraudel | 10155486463596509_1758664821060744 | CNN is so bias. The nasty woman comment came after she threw a cheap shot at Trump about avoiding taxes. They put the wrong quote up...deliberately...lmao
24 | Richard Manning | 10155486463596509_551981928333727 | You guys are pretty unreal.  Hillary swipes at Trump saying he probably didn't pay payroll taxes, he responds and you guys pretend it was in a vacuum.  Fortunately, people actually watched the debate so a half-serious political manipulation outlet like CNN can't trick everyone.
25 | Gerald Salamone | 10155486463596509_551959411669312 | Trump has never had to face a woman as an equal. You can see him simmering and ready to boil over during the debate. How dare she disagree with me, a rich powerful male!!!! Lol! You aren't my male role model Trump. Go away.

2 | Ai Takahashi | 10155486412716509_10155486455186509 | Awesome that you folks released it back.  I'm sure it was decades old...probably not many left. Kudos to you for having a great story to tell while still  respecting such living creatures...
3 | Ben Alexander | 10155486412716509_10155486415801509 | The fact that Hillary is not wearing an American flag pin says it all. She is not for America. She is only for herself. If she wins, we all lose. She is a liar, criminal and a con artist. We need real change!

5 | A.J. Pinto | 10155486412716509_10155486418086509 | I am wondering, if the actions of the Clinton foundation are legal. I do not get how you can collect money for a social cause and keep most of the money for yourself and get not prosecuted.
6 | Julian Kolicci | 10155486412716509_10155486414571509 | I remember once when my dad gave me money to pay the electricity bill but instead I bought a raffle ticket for a brand new car. When I got home, I explained to my dad what I did and he beat the crap out of me. But the next day, when my dad woke up and opened the door, outside my house was a brand new car. We all cried especially me, because the car was from the electricity company, they were there to cut off the electricity, my dad beat the crap out of me again!Ps: yes I know you've read this story before, read it againüëçüèº

2 | Jorge W DeQueiroz | 10155486357436509_10155486365941509 | No trust in hrc, msm and cronies.What BO/HRC have done to Chelsea Manning, Snowden and Assange show we have no rights and freedom of the press and speech. We live in a totalitarian State of a kleptocracy.I'm no great DT fan but the allegations of outright msm pro-hrc PR campaign and avoidance of hrc's destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice, lies and scandals published by Wikileaks which are far more grave make me certain that the only way to see the truth is to alternate power.
3 | Emily Lazzell | 10155486357436509_10155486410601509 | Moments after the debate, I went on CNN's link to vote on who I thought won the debate. The poll had been closed, and an entire detailed article was posted. How did CNN allow people to voice their opinion and publish an article on our opinion just 30 minutes after the debate? When did people who actually watched the debate have time to vote in their "poll?" Within 30 minutes of the debate ending, they had an article telling you what the people of this country thought of the debate. That's some pretty amazing brainwashing, err I mean journalism CNN. Keep up the great work! Although, I think you'll find people are done being told how they should interpret things. Stop playing us like ignorant little sheep.

5 | Tammy Stecher Geraldson | 10155486357436509_10155486449756509 | This is one of the stupidest articles I have ever read. It sounds like the author made up a "code" she could then "decode" for the rest of us. I guess it's job security since she's the correspondent for "race and inequality."  Apparently, she is clairvoyant and can interpret what peoples "real" thoughts are hidden behind what they are saying.  #eyeroll

9 | John Lesch | 10155486357436509_10155487013031509 | Get ready for a LANDSLIDE Trump victory in America, it's going to be a huge win for American sovereignty and the final death blow to Globalism (new world order).. The Majority of Americans are voting for Trump because they are sick of business as usual in Washington DC and the American people are fed up with the criminality/corruption that runs rampant in the Federal Government.. There is a Monster vote just hiding under the surface and election day it's going to be seen, so many closet Trump supporters.. Trump = American sovereignty and Hillary Clinton = Globalism (new world order)... Anyone voting for Clinton seriously needs their heads examined.. Trump is the real deal and is not a Puppet to the Globalists. That's why the Zionist mass media, both political parties and the entire Globalist establishment are attacking Trump in every direction possible... The Globalists are losing control every step of the way and the desperation is extremely obvious.
10 | Omega Reyes | 10155486357436509_10155486463601509 | True Americans this is our last chance. The Democrats are lying deceiving non Americans run by the 1% of the worlds elite with all the money to destroy our country with hate and big corruption. To keep the good people penned down right where they need us and with time no power to vote. The far left and with there illegally immigrants set up to cast votes we  will be out number sooner then we think, and breed Democrat votes from now on, and with our hard working Americans tax money supporting them. It is a disgrace to our way of life. We must fight back with the biggest outcome to Vote in history to overcome this sinister way of life, it will be a sad world if Hillary Clinton wins this election. God have mercy on the true Americans. We must vote Donald Trump üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
11 | Alice Bowman | 10155486357436509_10155486465946509 | Even though it's clear that Hillary and her clan should be in prison:Forget the smear campaign on both sides.

But he did it for the people! Aaand his lakefront vacation home.The DNC created fake, sexist ads under the alias of Trump organizations.Hillary believed Obama committed voter fraud.1Clinton staffers wished the San Bernardino shooter was white.The Clinton campaign is HUGE on media collusion.Speaking of media collusion, Ezra Klein is big on helping to make that happen.Hillary knowingly, criminally deleted her emails.Obama and Hillary communicated via private email, and it was kept hidden.

Most eclectic. I won all the eclectorial votes of the GOP and after the eclection I'll be voted the most eclectic person ever. I'll have more eclectorial votes than anyone else.

Racists.Hey we are guilty of some things but The Donald is guilty of everything. He did make some good points against Hilary but only if he could mask that carrot top bigotry of his.
17 | Giovani Morgs | 10155486357436509_10155486424021509 | In my opinion, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Donald Trump is a sexual predator and those 11 women that came forward were savagely attacked by Trump and he knows it. I really believe that Trump should start writing out his concession speech and say these words..... Hillary, you're hired !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18 | Adam Francisco | 10155486357436509_10155486843876509 | -i lived in inner cities. its bad-there is very obvious bias, no question.-criminal illegal aliens are literally a thing, as defined by LAW.-"deplorables" is nothing but a derogatory term, like name calling as a kid.

They were lining up and saying to me: Is it true that the American Congress might default on America‚Äôs full faith and credit, their standing, that you won‚Äôt pay your bills?And you know I‚Äôm sitting there, I‚Äôm representing all of you. I said: Oh, no. No. No. That‚Äôs just politics. We‚Äôll work it through. And I‚Äôm sitting there: Oh, boy. I hope that is the case.So for all of their efforts to take advantage of whatever mistake we might make or whatever problem we might have, they know right now at least in 2013, the beginning of this century, the United States isn‚Äôt strong at home and abroad. They‚Äôve got problems, and it is for me pretty simple. If we don‚Äôt get our political house in order and demonstrate that we can start making decisions again ‚Äî and that takes hard work.
20 | Michael Scott | 10155486357436509_10155486443651509 | The only dog whistles are by CNN thinking the American people are idiots changing the news to fit there agenda. Hillarys campaign gets caught red handed giving money to people to riot and insight violence at Trump rallys last time anyone checked that was against the law. No matter what you think of Trump this is an act of tring to intimate by fear and violence Hillary Clinton campaign should be held responsible and prosecuted and cnn has yet to report on it.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Gary Basham | 10155486269996509_10155486271301509 | Can anyone tell me without mentioning Hillary, what part of Trump's performance tonight would convince an undecided voter that he is fit and qualified to be president?
2 | Andy Denver | 10155486269996509_10155486274476509 | If some conservative called Hillary a turd - CNN would be apoplectic in attacking such rhetoric, but what is ok for liberals is never ok if a conservative did it.
3 | Doug Christian | 10155486269996509_10155486272021509 | I thought Trump nailed it on this final debate! Hillary had no where to go when Trump brought up her deleting 33,000 emails, lying about the fact that there were "classified" emails present, and getting off scott free when a 4 star general is about to serve 4 years in prison for lying to the FBI. She had nothing to say about her campaign being exposed for sending people to create chaos at Trump rallies... But the clear difference is between how Hillary wants to promote not just abortion, but partial birth abortion and Planned Parenthood. Trump wants to end it. On that fact alone, our country would be better off to stop killing unborn babies!!!
4 | Joanie Einaoj | 10155486269996509_10155486292616509 | He said he'll run the country like he's run his companies .Ooook so low pay .no benefits..THEN declare bankruptcy and consider those who worked for you collateral damage
5 | Jonathan Marsolf | 10155486269996509_10155486276426509 | Im an independent voter. I don't care about what was said 11 years ago. I care about actions and issues. And honestly I'm leaning closer to Trump than anyone else. Though I'm still considering Gary Johnson.If Trump is so dangerous than why did America vote him at least this far into the race?What type of message does this send to the career polititions? It tells them that they are so far out of touch with America and that we've finally had enough. The Democrats too. Not Just Republicans!Democrats voted Sanders in Yet Hillary and the DNC rigged the elections to push Hillary this far. The message is sent. The career polititions know that America is fed up with them. Trump didn't rig the elections but Hillary did. The Mainstream media clames that there is no evadince of that but there's a video circulating online everywhere and it clearly shows voter fruad is rampant with the democrats. And Obama tells Trump to stop talking about it?Like him or not but Trump is fighting for our rights and will clean up Washington. That's what they're afraid of. That's what makes Trump so "Dangerous". He's not the one that put our National Security at risk with a private surver. Even further Hillary exposed our nuclear responce time tonight during the debate. She cant even keep classified information classified.And you wonder why Trump is talking about voter fraud and why he'll "keep you in suspense".He has a legitimate reason. Take a look at Bernie Sanders. He was robbed of his spot on that stage.https://youtu.be/5IuJGHuIkzYhttps://youtu.be/hDc8PVCvfKshttps://youtu.be/DIdeNJbym7Mhttps://youtu.be/8PwmkayNgLgWikileaks could be getting the Emails from the FBI. Fact is we don't know who is giving the Emails to them. But the information is damming and should be taken seriously. Ignoring them is worst then letting Trump into office.You don't want to vote for Trump than thats fine, but you do know there are 4 people in the race. Two of which don't get much coverage but are more than capable. But the fact is Hillary is far from capable.
6 | Ben Alexander | 10155486269996509_10155486278526509 | Trump couldn't run a casino how can he run a country. He inherited his wealth and pissed most of it away. He also started a fake university
7 | Anne A. Chevrier | 10155486269996509_10155486272661509 | Why did she just tell the entire world HOW LONG it takes for us to LAUCH A NUKE?? Shouldn't that be "top secret classified???" She just proved herself to the nation, that she gives classified material.
8 | Lisa Osborne | 10155486269996509_10155486280801509 | This is such a non issue. Are you serious going with this headline? Gore 2000. He didn't concede and took it to the supreme court. Also what about the proof of the corruption?
9 | Gles Stewart | 10155486269996509_10155486329206509 | Been a long time viewer of CNN and I have to say I am extremely let down with how you have handled the whole election this year. It has seemed that you are allowing each of your employees to very much so treat Donald trump very unfairly and it seems each day more and more every other story I see one of your anchors is trash talking him and and just looking for new ways to attack him and this just does not seem right. Your station should not be choosing sides and treating trump to me seems in humane and comes across almost as bullying him more and more each day. I think this year the election has attracted the most younger voters from any election and I feel like your making it seem ok the way your station has been bullying him more and more each day. When I tune in now it seems every other story that comes up its a new attack against trump. I have yet to see one story last longer then one day about Clinton. Very much so not happy with how your station is handling him and losing one of your viewers very quickly.
10 | Charlie Mike | 10155486269996509_10155486276771509 | If you are completely slamming Trump and not Hillary at the same time, you're complete idiot. I don't even know how you tie your shoes in the morning, let alone have managed to live this long.
11 | John Liberto | 10155486269996509_10155486285276509 | So what you're really saying the only polishable TURD in this race is Hil-Liar-y?  So Hil-liar-y is a turd,, but a shiny one.
12 | E Harrington Bussert | 10155486269996509_10155486286091509 | Wow, how soon they forget: i.e. Al GoreWhat is pathetic is CNN, the rest of the Main Stream Media and even some Republican's trying to get a concession statement from Trump 3 weeks before the the election.  Another attempt by the Democrats and the media to disrupt the election, it is called grooming or rigging.
13 | Andrew Beverley | 10155486269996509_10155486285291509 | Trump is demanding accountability on all aspects of our democracy. With all this recent evidence of fraud and videos of DNC corruption I applaud his answer of waiting till election day because who knows what might happen. Trump exposing all this is a win for every American!
14 | Mariane Dias Seminario | 10155486269996509_10155486332161509 | üòÇ I was actually watching it when he said it and my 9 year old, my 13 year old and I cracked up üòÇ Van Jones made our day lol!

Give me a break the primaries were fixed and Bernie Sanders got screwed! What makes you think that wasn't a practice run for the presidential election? Why don't you clowns stop looking for little things to pick at! Last week it was that Trump was a womanizer! Come on people Kennedy and Clinton were both womanizers and people loved both of them. Stick to the issues and start reporting all of the illegal things that are going on in this election and STOP playing favorites! Have you forgotten that reporters are supposed to be objective and report wrongdoings! CNN has lost ALL credibility as far as I'm concerned and their are MANY people who feel the same way! You must think that we are sheep! NEWS FLASH: AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT SHEEP!
16 | J Carol Fisher | 10155486269996509_10155486421461509 | Mr. Van Jones, thank you for speaking up.  you hit it on so many vital issues and points.  I think you expressed how i am feeling down here in TEXAS.  i have the same emotions on the disrespectful issue you brought up to Jeffrey and Keighlee M.  and they are just a little too proud and smug even when they are WRONG, WRONG, WRONG !  Thank you , sir , for expressing my feelings also!
17 | Kissa McElroy Pittman | 10155486269996509_1285802024804117 | Oh my Gosh, it is so hard to watch CNN. So in the tank for Hillary. And all the bad guys there. Jake Tapper, ugh. Get that scowl off your face, or it will be set for life. Wolf, In love with Hillary. Anderson, always for Hillary. Use to be less biased, but that has changed, as all of CNN has. You, who think you know so much, need to read some of these comments. Mostly in favor or Trump. Yes, even on CNN. Everyone, by now, knows that Hillary lies about everything and could never be trusted. She has one goal since meeting Bill. Be president and $$$$. She is totally for herself. And BTW, that foundation only gave 10% to charity. The rest went for fun, expensive things. Hardly a thing for those kids she claims to be protecting all these years. Open mouth, a lie will come out. Pathological. Just like Brian Williams lied for no reason.Yet, these kinds of people I just named will delightedly vote for her. Heads in sand, or just don't care for their country.
18 | Bill Pettigrew | 10155486269996509_10155486348846509 | The Great Orange Embarrassment strikes again he actual said I will have to see and I will keep you guessing like he is talking about a reality show not the most sacred of Presidential Election traditions! Unfreakin believable

20 | Melville Lotter | 10155486269996509_10155486411231509 | Van Jones is the biggest idiot that CNN ever could get to give comments on the US election. His comments cant be taken seriously at all.Frankly i think he is a racist with a lot of issues.
21 | Debra Kelly | 10155486269996509_10155486297146509 | Last I check you dont concede until it is over not 20 days before hand. This sounds so much like the primary's when reps were bashing Trump and then had him sign a pledge which most have not honor. I didnt see them ask Hillary this question.
22 | Fitz Greg | 10155486269996509_10155486284546509 | CNN seems pretty proud that someone that works for their network said the word turd against a Republican that they keep posting the same thing every hour. #BiasedMedia once again...You know they would condemn the reporter if they said that against a Democrat
23 | Rose Brock | 10155486269996509_10155486342731509 | Listen you ( wish I could call you what I wish that it would be a ....., you stand for nothing!!

25 | Denise Jo Webb Hemenway | 10155486269996509_10155486325781509 | FBI FORGOT TO CHECK FEDERAL LAW    Wonder how many people are aware of this?  Word for word from the Cornell Law Library - RE: H Clinton  Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Law Library.  Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office.  Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071. Here's what it says:"(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.(b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.  Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States."  Shouldn't voters know that?  The media won't tell them.  So it's up to YOU!

Do some undocumented workers pay more income tax than Donald J. Trump? Did $6 billion go missing while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State?

The #CNNRealityCheck Team spent the night analyzing claims from tonight's #debate. Here's what they found:
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Nick Rice | 10155486168316509_10155486179676509 | She's a proven liar and traitor who sold out national security for profit. Deleting the emails and WikiLeaks proved it. No way we should elect a modern day Benedict Arnold just because we want a woman president
2 | Melbin Gonzalez | 10155486168316509_10155486174871509 | Q:What do Donald Trump and a Pumpkin have in common?A:They're orange on the outside, hollow on the inside and responsible people will throw them away in early November.
3 | Curtis Spicer | 10155486168316509_10155486184251509 | Keep it up CNN all your doing is proving All trump voters and the rest of America right, your corrupt and it continues to show. Thank you!
4 | Alex McGovern | 10155486168316509_10155486216621509 | Hillary Clinton was addressing a group of American Indians in New York telling them all she did as senator and all she plans to do for them as President. At the end of the meeting the chief gave her a plaque with her honorary indian name, Walking Eagle. After she left someone asked the chief if there is any meaning to that name.

5 | Art Hutcheson | 10155486168316509_10155486210021509 | Yep...all of the Trump lovers left on his sinking ship dont like the mean and nasty CNN for telling the truth about your Pumpkin headed dictator....
6 | Alexis Gonzalez | 10155486168316509_10155486177636509 | Tonight Hillary confirmed she will send troops to Syria, where Russia is playing a huge role. I refuse to vote for the woman who will send in  my brothers and sisters in arms to ANOTHER middle eastern conflict to get slaughtered! Wasn't Iraq and Benghazi enough bloodshed for you, Hillary?! üò°üò°üò°
7 | Native Son | 10155486168316509_10155486179736509 | why in the world would I trust any fact-checking by CNN when it's clear and obvious that you not only support Hillary but you paint every other candidate as either irrelevant or a liar, bigot or womanizer. I think I'll stick to my own fact checking thank you.  And FYI the last person who said it was illegal to read was who????  Oh that's right, ... It was HITLER.  üòâ
8 | Ben Alexander | 10155486168316509_10155486204896509 | Trump couldn't run a casino how can he run a country. He inherited his wealth and pissed most of it away. He also started a fake university. He isn't fit to run a fantasy baseball league
9 | Aria Saghafi | 10155486168316509_10155486281786509 | Its funny how All the Media Gods are against Trump. He is the only man that has spoken the truth about the political situation of the world and the role of USA in it....
10 | Tara Anne | 10155486168316509_10155486438001509 | I'm from Canada and admittedly don't love Trump for various reasons but my goodness it is so clear to me that Hillary Clinton is malicious, deceptive, dishonest and fully corrupt. While I wish even better than Trump for my American neighbours, I truly believe he has good intentions at a minimum. Funny to me how everyone gets so hot under the collar about his 'unpolished' ways but at least you can trust that you aren't being completely duped by a robotic, methodical, well-trained establishment politician that can lie seamlessly and effortlessly in a pinch. How is that a positive? And CNN - I can't even watch your reporting on the election. It's wildly biased and dishonest. I'm actually shocked that this is legal. It's crazy, absolutely craziness the corruption. All I can say is that in the end, in one way or another each person will be accountable for their role in all of this. I wouldn't want to have even a hint of affiliation with the Democratic Party liberal left right now. Wow.
11 | Que Sue | 10155486168316509_10155486215701509 | CNN sucks... It is a dam shame that not one of you there will grow a set of ballocks and tell the American people the truth about what the Clintons have done.. Dont spend all that "HUSH" money all in one place, maybe save some for the U-Haul to move to Canada.. I bet that your parents are proud of you, because i am ashamed that your even on the air, wasting air time... Trump will be POTUS, Go Trump2016..
12 | Rocky Gibson | 10155486168316509_10155486301456509 | Misplaced or lost...no matter how you word it...6billion is missing...so get it right CNN...Trump is right!!!!Hillary should be investigated for rigging polls and tampering with a federal process to swing votes.,.bengahzi,lying to the american people and the government....and the FBI should also be investigated for corruption!! And so should the media for false accusations!!! And trying to instigate a conflict with Russia!!!!!
13 | Gordon John Tkachuk | 10155486168316509_10155486305661509 | CNN, did you even watch the debate? Oh wait you aired it! The liberal media at it's best! Trump crushed  Crooked Clinton , so just keep on trying to spin it how you like, you look worse than Hillary! What a joke!
14 | Steve Smith | 10155486168316509_10155486220151509 | Best point of the night by far was by trump about how illegal immigrants get treated better than our vets. That's a real problem and if you don't have a problem with it regardless of who you're voting for, you should. We have a military for a reason and it's voluntary. Yea, many of the conflicts may be lies and deception on the part of corrupt politicians but there are serious threats in the world and lots of people who would love to harm America and Americans. A lot of those vets keep you and I safe and we don't even know what they are doing to do that because they do it humbly and quietly and don't seek the credit. They deserve to at least have decent healthcare and medical and psychological support when they get back, and if we are denying them of that while taking care of people who come here illegally, our priorities are out of whack.
15 | Thess Isorena | 10155486168316509_10155486246186509 | The real  reason why Donald Trump run for Presidency is to save himself from Hillarys plan to put Higher tax on big Corporation like  what he owns. He is not running for President to save Americans lives. That is why All his attacks with Hillary are personal. I bet other people picked  up that political lines on TV as well.
16 | Kelley Rae | 10155486168316509_10155486272721509 | Who cares if they did pay more than he did...exactly what Trump said, she put that law into effect. I am self employed and I know that I write off every single thing I possibly can, just as he does
17 | James Austin | 10155486168316509_10155486422366509 | Advertising our nations response time to launching a nuclear weapon on live television is smart Hillary Clinton. Especially since tensions between Russia and the United States are at Cold War levels if not worse. She says Trump can't be trusted with the nuke codes but yet advertised CF info on television!
18 | Josh Marshall | 10155486168316509_1159890634079821 | Of the two candidates running for president...Only Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress.Only Hillary Clinton was fired from a job for being unethical.Only Hillary Clinton deleted 30 some thousand emails after she was ordered to hand them over to the Fed.Only Hillary Clinton had that same computer wiped clean by professionals.Only Hillary Clinton got the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughed about it.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about Benghazi.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about her emails.Only Hillary Clinton lied about being under sniper fire.Only Hillary Clinton lied about lying to the American people.Only Hillary Clinton was involved in " Cash Cow "Only Hillary Clinton has a long list of scandals.Only Hillary Clinton nationally belittled her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers.Only Hillary Clinton is a career politician.Only Hillary Clinton will not release her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banks.Only Hillary Clinton is tied to Monsanto.Only Hillary Clinton was labeled " Extremely careless " about national security by the FBI!Only Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class.Only Hillary Clinton benefited from the DNC rigging an election!Only Hillary Clinton had to return stolen items from the White House.Only Hillary Clinton said the Benghazi victims parents where lying.Only Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her based on her gender.Only Hillary Clinton has no real accomplishments after a lifetime in politics.Only Hillary Clinton has never created any jobs.Only Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI and found to have put national security at risk.Only Hillary Clinton has had two or more movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics.Only Hillary Clinton was called "Broomstick one" by the SS.Only Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would of simply told the truth in the first place ! Fact - all facts!Only Hillary Clinton regularly cussed out and belittled her SS detail.Only Hillary Clinton Only Hillary Clinton Only Hillary Clinton over and over again.But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump? That is insane!I will never understand how any moral person in good consciencecould vote for this woman.(This is just a small percentage of a much longer list)
19 | John Livinston | 10155486168316509_10155486217361509 | wow - looks like Trump was forced to take a few Ritalin's before the debate, but it started wearing off 30mins into the debate!
20 | Debbie Young | 10155486168316509_10155486240561509 | So ridiculous!  I have had so many Hispanic workers.  They simply put 10 dependents on their tax forms at work and they don't pay taxes.  The employer is not allowed to question this either.  Every employer knows this CNN.  You are clueless and biased.
21 | Heavenly Hughes | 10155486168316509_10155486213851509 | Yeah, Hillary and Trump has pulled off the most entertaining Presidential Campaign EVER! It seems to be a lose/lose situation for America.. #RealityShow
22 | Aaron Lucero | 10155486168316509_10155486331231509 | The $6billion dollar question was answered with a bunch of bs.. you lose contracts and facts about deals, how can you accurately tally up the owed money, or where it went, this chick is fishy! Vote Trump
23 | Summer Trosper | 10155486168316509_10155486408711509 | I have never seen so many people hate their own country until Donald duck found his way to run for the most important job in our country. It's truly sad I believe that there is a lot to be proud of in our country. God bless America and God bless those with so much hate in their heart.
24 | Tracie Turner Shipman | 10155486168316509_10155486404206509 | Some of the Wikileaks revelations:Hillary wants open borders.The Iran deal was awful and even Democrats know it.Bernie Sanders was bribed into supporting Hillary. But he did it for the people! Aaand his lakefront vacation home.The DNC created fake, sexist ads under the alias of Trump organizations.Hillary believed Obama committed voter fraud.1Clinton staffers wished the San Bernardino shooter was white.The Clinton campaign is HUGE on media collusion.Speaking of media collusion, Ezra Klein is big on helping to make that happen.Hillary knowingly, criminally deleted her emails.Obama and Hillary communicated via private email, and it was kept hidden.
25 | Todd Fifield | 10155486168316509_10155486318206509 | Hillary cared about the children in other country's but did not care if a woman had abortion one day before the due date..give me a break..she makes me sick..she will say what she has to say to get the black voters the gay voters, the woman voters..what a joke

Here's the question that made Donald J. Trump's campaign manager abruptly end an interview with CNN just moments after the #debate http://cnn.it/2evQfGw
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Alison L. Dunn | 10155486026691509_10155486027486509 | Let's end the suspense Donald ....... you're unfit -- #YoureFired.
2 | Timothy Reagin | 10155486026691509_10155486043256509 | You Trump supporters, you don't have to get so defensive and mad. You are losing. It's okay to lose. Buckle up for the next four - eight years of an amazing new president!
3 | A.J. Pinto | 10155486026691509_10155486029251509 | Tonight Hillary confirmed she will send troops to Syria, where Russia is playing a huge role. I refuse to vote for the woman who will send in  my brothers and sisters in arms to ANOTHER middle eastern conflict to get slaughtered! Wasn't Iraq enough for you, Killary?! üò°üò°üò°
4 | Christina Tice | 10155486026691509_10155486065316509 | I would walk away too. She realized that no matter what she said, CNN was going to twist and turn it into what they want. Why waste breath on such biased media? When CNN decides that they actually want to put out both candidates views and faults EQUALLY, maybe Kellyanne will reconsider answering more questions....
5 | Bob Miller | 10155486026691509_10155486042071509 | That awkward moment when CNN tries to act like a credible and unbiased "news" outlet. EVERYONE is on to your verbal  diarrhea. #corruptnewsnetwork
6 | Logan Reid | 10155486026691509_10155486045691509 | This "news" site has exposed itself for what it really is. A piss poor news station that tells a 1/4 of the story about Clinton, then over exaggerates anything to do with trump.
7 | Elaina Houchens | 10155486026691509_10155486106461509 | I can't believe how many people here are commenting that CNN is biased. Why are you watching? I don't watch Fox News. Ever. I have no idea what they say and I don't care. I will concede CNN seems to spend time on Trumps issues but it's because he is so ludicrous. It's like the elephant in the room. It HAS to be addressed. Americans do not need CNN to tell us what we see from the man himself. He is a sociopath. Those of us who disagreed with other nominees simply strongly disagreed. But with Trump he sickens us. His antics and distasteful comment need to be addressed and I am grateful the media does the right thing and discusses it!
8 | Vincent James Mcentee | 10155486026691509_10155486029196509 | Hah, just like Trump. Unqualified for basic questions.
9 | Mike Urquhart | 10155486026691509_10155486050106509 | Idiots! She spent time answering questions and she had lots more people to see so she moved on when she was done. BE THANKFUL she even gave you 1 minute because of the corruption coming from CNN! What was it? $187K you gave to the Clinton campaign?? Please. Corrupt corrupt corrupt!!!
10 | Dan Milano | 10155486026691509_2144202862470831 | She gave a two minute interview backstage, covered the topic inside and out and moved on to other press. Yeah there was a little "bye Felicia" in her departure but hardly worth a story in its own right
11 | Enna Romero | 10155486026691509_10155486072781509 | I feel sorry for all the people that have to lie and defend the impossible, he is a big LOOSER and just don't want to admit it!!! He was never hired and now he is fired for a job he never obtained nor deserve! Go Hilary!!!!! I am with 60% of this country!!! I am with her!!!
12 | Michelle Snay Lantz | 10155486026691509_10155486034656509 | Considering what's been going on in Indiana alone with voter fraud, I think we all have a right to question it's integrity and wait to see how it goes before answering that which may very well be a possibility.
13 | John Cupac | 10155486026691509_10155486057951509 | CNN you made a joke out of yourself She opens with what we have been all talking about tonight ....Not about the economy, war, taxes, Isis, illegal immigrants or any other major issueShe talks about will trump talk about him losingCNN really covering the real issues facing America lol
14 | Jordan Cagle | 10155486026691509_10155486028861509 | Hey CNN, how was the wine at Hillary's "off the record" dinner party?http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/17/wikileaks-journalists-clinton-staff-homes-before-hillarys-campaign-launch/
15 | Jason Loch | 10155486026691509_10155486054041509 | Don't blame her as the reporter kept cutting her off when she was trying to answer her last question, but because the reporter didn't like anyone defending Trump she kept cutting her off. Media so one side and protecting there investments.
16 | Zoe Kaiser | 10155486026691509_10155486065026509 | She didn't abruptly end the interview. She answered it multiple times lol. CNN loves to replay, and repost irrelevant crap over & over & over. She simply walked away with pride. Good try though.
17 | Jessica Wright | 10155486026691509_10155486117441509 | Would just like to point out that in the last few hours you have posted 15+ negative articles about Donald Trump and 0 stories about Clinton, aside from embellished poll numbers. How is this journalism? How is this anything but an attempt to brainwash Americans into voting the way that would benefit your executives more than the everyday American?  You would never know that there are two other candidates in this race. What a joke. So much for unbiased "journalism"
18 | Logan Reid | 10155486026691509_10155486069176509 | Since there are clearly a ton of liberals here, how do you feel about Clinton not responding to our men who were begging her to send help in Benghazi? Or what do you think about these emails being released showing who Clinton really is?
19 | Lynn Roberge | 10155486026691509_10155486043506509 | I challenge Democrats, Independents and Republicans to look up Project Veritas and Wikileaks to see what type of dishonest and corrupt campaign Hillary has been running. PS She careS more about illegals than she does OUR VETS AND HOMELESS
20 | Shandy Elliott | 10155486026691509_602463916602975 | This is why so many people chant about CNN lying. This headline is highly deceptive. Kellyanne answered her questions and as many times that happens, people are pulled away and have to leave. Why aren't people raising the same ruckus about how Hillary constantly walks away from the reporters who follow her on the plane? Hillary even did so tonight even though reporters were still asking questions. If you don't walk away sometimes, the reporters will ask 100 questions. I'm pretty sure Kellyanne is exhausted and sick of dealing with crap such as CNN creating such ridiculous headlines as this. People, get real.
21 | Steve Todd | 10155486026691509_602464899936210 | Not a trump supporter, neither am I ,not, one. But CNN is getting rediculess. She did not walk away from the interview because of some hard question. She did what all supporters of both sides did after the debate; answered a couple of questions and moved on. The interviewer was even trying to come up with another question as she was leaving but didn't. Honestly the blatantly bias news coverage makes me disregard most of the rediculess articles.
22 | Anthony Giffin | 10155486026691509_10155486139431509 | Watching all this from Canada you see what the Trump camp has done to your great country.. the people who follow him are also to blame in the backing his lie's and tantrums, he acts like a child if he doesn't get his own way.. he will say anything to avoid taking any blame onto himself.. he has divided his own party.. he has flip flopped on everything.. Trump is a sick man.. you see it in others when there mind work as his does.. I have faith in the great people of the great nation of the U.S.A. that they will make the right choice and not vote this sick narcissistic man in office.. I know we from Canada have faith in all of you..
23 | Cory Schroeder | 10155486026691509_602463713269662 | Dear lord....CNN you are so sad and pathetic with your constant slandering post on Trump. Whooooo "she walked away"....yea after a lengthy interview and more than likely went on to another interview. Regardless...she stood their and took question from a knowing bias media reporter when she didn't have to.Let me know when Hillary will actually do an interview with someone from Fox like Hannity.
24 | Robles Andrew | 10155486026691509_10155486070911509 | I'm voting for trump because I have no other choice. Anyone but the witch!!! If Micky Mouse was running against the witch--- I would vote for Micky !!' We did have some more intelligent people like Sen. Cruz who would have left the witch speechless !!! Cruz IS a true Conservative Constitutional Christian. I just pray that Trump win's against the witch... Plus all Trump had to mention was BENGHAZI ... The witch would have melted or exploded with anger... Do we want our Military to have a Commander in Chief who is willing to see them die under her command?
25 | Jerry Waugaman | 10155486026691509_10155486130101509 | Looks to me like her time was up! Believe it or not there are people who have better things to do than talk to CNN! I know! Shock, right! Be thankful that on a night like this and as busy as she probably was that she still gave some time to a rag such as yours!

Donald J. Trump claimed he "did not say" the women who accused him of unwanted sexual advances were not attractive enough. That's false, as this video shows. http://cnn.it/2e8iPQ9
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ashley Graves | 10155485893641509_10155485897536509 | If I was to run for president....I would promise to legalize marijuana, repeal common core math, and impose a federal ban on an extra charge for guacamole. Vote for me, cause guacamole should be free
2 | Matt Romain | 10155485893641509_10155485898366509 | Ok CNN, why don't you stop being biased to sway voters and do your job and report on the good and bad about both candidates. I can't remember an election where the news was so bought that they only played to one side
3 | Alexis Gonzalez | 10155485893641509_10155485895376509 | Tonight Hillary confirmed she will send troops to Syria, where Russia is playing a huge role.

4 | Tom Knopka | 10155485893641509_10155485896296509 | Before the comments get too nasty. Here is a positive one. I hope the remainder of your week is a great one. God bless you. God bless everyone. God bless America!
5 | Timothy Reagin | 10155485893641509_10155485895951509 | Trump is such a liar but most Trump supporters are into tin foil hat mode so hard right now that I'm not sure they will ever recover
6 | Gwen-Timmons Ohman | 10155485893641509_10155485914361509 | You assume that is what he is saying. The women should have come forward 30 years ago. They show up 3 weeks before election??? Something Fishy here. Go Trump.
7 | Jonathan Parks | 10155485893641509_10155485917701509 | CNN - you are the most biased and crappy media station out there.. despite the fact that both candidates are completely unqualified - I would hope that one day the world would see how corrupt your dumb lying news reports are and come together to shut you down. Your the ugliest reporters out there.** Amazing how many libtards read my comment and automatically assume i support Trump** its hillaryous
8 | Kevin Durrell | 10155485893641509_10155485927196509 | I love how Trump supporters say CNN is bias against Trump when they report five stories on Trump and one about Hillary. What is reported about Trump is mostly video of Trump making himself look bad.
9 | Erick J. Sorto | 10155485893641509_10155485906546509 | Trump only says polls are fair when he is winning, sounds like a sore losers to me. He better get used to losing because he choked today and he did it "bigly"
10 | CJ Mehus | 10155485893641509_10155485912576509 | ......but seriously though, how do you "forget" that you're constantly being audio/video taped? He lies like this all the time- and people pull the audio/video all the time. He's a chronic liar.
11 | Sheila Hollan Gabbard | 10155485893641509_10155485920731509 | Your credibility as journalist and a news organization is shot. You better be trying to get Hillary elected Trump gets in there you all are in for a world of üò≠
12 | Robles Andrew | 10155485893641509_10155485928331509 | I'm voting for trump because I have no other choice. Anyone but the witch!!!

13 | Matthew Tso | 10155485893641509_10155485930646509 | What good does it do for Trump to accuse Clinton of lying when he's spewing a lot more lies himself and then denying he said them??
14 | Paul Wagner | 10155485893641509_10155485943731509 | "Look at her, I don't think so" is fairly clear in referencing looks. He said he didn't apologize to Melania and she said he did, on tape, to Anderson Cooper. So which one is lying, Dump or Melania?
15 | William Gregory | 10155485893641509_10155485963551509 | Donald J. Trump's biggest problem is his endless ego!  His ego goes on the defense instead of sticking to the main issue. That is where people become unsure about him. He sounds like a teenager. He's so thin-skinned.
16 | Jutieh Lincoln | 10155485893641509_10155485939416509 | Is Donald Trump just a pathological liar who likes to project his misfortunes on others or can we attribute his behavior to his childhood and the way his parents consistently concealed all of his mishaps by reassuring him that he was such a terrific kid? For those of us who have children, we must learn from this real life experiment and ensure we don't create more Donald Trumps for our beloved country. It would be a 'total disaster'!
17 | Charles Nguyen | 10155485893641509_10155485926941509 | Who care we want to hear the issue cnn is bias that all u got this election is rigged media sold their soul to hillary
18 | Tony Macedo Sr | 10155485893641509_10155485937991509 | DEMOCRATS PAID FOR VIOLENCE AT TRUMP RALLIES ?? OMG,, and you people are reporting he won't congratulate the winner/ what////////// what are you people aliens? no wonder CNN gets 1/4 of fox viewers/lol. what a joke
19 | James Chambers | 10155485893641509_10155485921756509 | How about a story on her refusal to answer questions about planting demonstrators at Trump rally's or about the failed Haitian relief commission, or about the wikileaks information release?
20 | Ugochi Ibesouba | 10155485893641509_10155485930381509 | How come he is such a great liar but calls his opponent a liar. He is also a corrupt business man who wants to clean up Washington. What an irony!  You have to be a truthful and straight forward person ,who lives by example in order to do so. What we see is a tax cheat, women groping mechine . A failed business man with so much debt.
21 | Jason Bohl | 10155485893641509_10155485964331509 | So now a man can't decide whether they think a women is attractive or not? Man I guess in this government we even lost freedom of opinion. If someone said  lie about me this outrageous I too would state my honest opinion. After all these ladies coming forth now about these claims only shows they want their 10 mins. of fame. I too would state my opinion just to shut them up and let them know that I wouldn't touch them with a 10 foot pole if I had too.
22 | Jason Ritterband-Fulcher | 10155485893641509_10155485933966509 | The media bias is outstanding! What about Hillary going for gun control in order to protect the children, whilst supporting pro-choice and voting against a proposal that would have banned termination after 20 weeks. There is something ironic there.
23 | Martin Lawson | 10155485893641509_10155486010216509 | Hillary didn't even try to deny that she paid people to incite violence. She never denied the emails and taking hammers to cellphones and ipads. Trump was right she should be in jail and not running for president.
24 | Trae Aplin | 10155485893641509_10155485916646509 | The fact that Hillary is not wearing an American flag pin says it all. She is not for America. She is for herself. If she wins, we all lose. She is a liar and a con artist. We need change! #makeamericagreatagain
25 | Ben Alexander | 10155485893641509_10155485974491509 | Trump couldn't run a casino how can he run a country. He inherited his wealth and pissed most of it away. He also started a fake university. He isn't fit to run a fantasy baseball league

1 | Javier Payan | 10155485796866509_10155485810516509 | Lmao! Impossible that KKKilary could  have stood a chance tonight. Trump won. CNN is so biased that Stevie wonder can see it. üòÇ
2 | Abdier De Jesus | 10155485796866509_10155485797071509 | NO she Didn't...Its amazing how almost all media is controlled by clinton..they are trying hard to manipulate and control the the voters mind with their fake propaganda..Cnn=clinton news network,abc,nbc,cbs,yahoo news ext..they do think they can control the mass population as Laboratory rats..
3 | Carlo Garza | 10155485796866509_10155485797196509 | Hillary team paid people to start RIOTS at TRUMP RALLY'S in Chicago and it's on VIDEO and nobody seems to bring that up WTF is wrong with y'all üò†
4 | Kathy Maichl-Jones | 10155485796866509_10155485813361509 | Such lies ... Trump totally called her out and she totally failed ... Your Hillary supporters live in a delusional world.  She's not even qualified to run.  She should be in prison for lying under oath to the FBI
5 | Luis Argueta | 10155485796866509_10155485808086509 | Trump won't commit to accepting election results because he is the Biggest Loser!!! In his eyes, everything is Rigged!! So ridiculous!!!! SMH!! #neverTrump #IAmwithHer #Hillary2016
6 | Bryan O. McDowell | 10155485796866509_10155485806176509 | Tonight a major party candidate for President of the United States said they support allowing full-term abortions, yet nobody in the media is talking about it. The complete disregard for life in this country is incredibly sad.
7 | Stephen Saunders | 10155485796866509_10155485815241509 | There are millions of people who intend to vote for Trump who aren't voicing the fact for fear of needless confrontation.  On election day, however, their voices will ring the loudest.
8 | Daniel Glover | 10155485796866509_10155485810556509 | Yeah because you can know this in about an hour after the debate ended correct? The same news organization that said having the WikiLeaks is illegal but press is allowed to have them. In other words you want to spread propaganda! Which is exactly what you are doing right here
9 | AnnMarie Guevarez | 10155485796866509_10155485816016509 | NO way thats because it is a CNN poll Frank Lutz  polled people at the debate that were there watching and they said Trump won. But CNN is in favor of Hillary so of course they will say she won.
10 | Inge Mueller Morse | 10155485796866509_10155485809906509 | Did anyone notice after the debate Melania came up to him but there were no hugs or kisses exchanged. He shook the boys hands and did air kisses, and kissed Tiffany. I didn't see Ivanka kiss him either. As he was leaving the stage, he took Melania's hand they walked maybe 2 steps and the hand holding was over. Looks like trouble in Trumpland. Look out world.. Mrs Trump 4 is not far away.
11 | Chris Lawson | 10155485796866509_10155485827101509 | No,  she did NOT win this debate. Anyway,  we all knew that CNN would say she did.  You guys probably had these numbers created before the debate ever even began. CNN has zero journalist integrity whatsoever. How does it feel to be owned by Hillary Clinton,  CNN? You guys are pitiful.
12 | Jay Torres | 10155485796866509_10155485818261509 | Hilary should be in jail, Trump should be debating Bernie.  Martha Stewart went to prison for lying once!  Hilary says she is haunted by the 4 yr old Syrian boys pic but she is perfectly fine with aborting a full term baby!  C'mon mannn.
13 | Alexis Gonzalez | 10155485796866509_10155485810791509 | Hillary Clinton just said tonight, that if a day before my daughter's birth they found something wrong with her, I had the "right" to rip her out in pieces. She was born in that time frame that Clinton would still allow abortions. THAT IS truly deplorable!
14 | Benjamin Nelson | 10155485796866509_10155485827346509 | Of course Hillary won a CNN poll. It's so liberally biased. She denied and avoided so many issues that could hurt her campaign. I hope voters see the truth about her eventually by Nov 8.
15 | Carla Tedeschi | 10155485796866509_1818728831746111 | CNN has no clue about how badly Trump trounced her.She lied repeatedly.She admitted that she has no problem KILLING babies up to the day of delivery!!!  MURDERERShe parroted back all her memorized statements. She has no feeling when she spouts and spews her lies.I will not vote for her.There are tons of adjectives to describe Hillary.Unfortunately, they are all felonies.
16 | Bryan Bergeron | 10155485796866509_10155485822031509 | Why aren't y'all talking about the fact that she dodged the question about the foundation she refused to say and answer the question about pay to play which tells me that if she gets in the White House it will be up for sale to the highest better
17 | Johnny Connelly | 10155485796866509_10155485810696509 | Regarding the debates tonight... I think Hillary and Trump both handled themselves well. Trump could have handled himself a lot better; however, considering Trump has spent the last few years as a TV star and Clinton has spent the last few years as a professional liar, I give the win to Trump since he has less experience lying to the public.Also, at the very beginning of the debate regarding the Supreme Court Justices... Did anyone notice how Hillary's response did not include the "Constitution of the United States" at all?Trump is a nationalist who loves the United States of America and loves the Constitution of the United States as it was originally meant to be interpreted.
18 | Pam Arnold Breault | 10155485796866509_1147885188627634 | NO SHE DIDNT!!! After watching the debate and seeing people's various posts on Facebook the biggest majority of those post state Trump won. Tonight's debate clearly showed how corrupt Clinton really is. Trump was dead on. He's got my vote!!
19 | James Main | 10155485796866509_1818730018412659 | Clinton News Network again trying to steer the masses. It really blows my mind how she is even running for president. Trump is one thing but this lady is a joke. These polls are so rigged. I haven't seen them say one thing half way decent about Trump. The bias of the lefty media is disheartens me. True Journalism is Dead in this country. They tell people it's illegal to read Wikileaks. You are drunk once again CNN. I still don't know anyone voting for Hilary. I'm not saying Trump is a saint but Hilary is a sellout to the elites. She will send us straight into War with Russia because that's what her puppet masters want.
20 | Dirk Winterbach | 10155485796866509_10155485832546509 | After the wikileaks and the veritas video CNN polls has now value !!! You cant call 300 people that is 70% democrat and tell the world that crooked women won !!! If she only got 52% out of 70% dem voters she is actually doing very bad !!!
21 | Stephanie Wall | 10155485796866509_10155485825606509 | Cnn , what about this? How long will you jump in the corrupt waters . When did you stop reporting real and honest news.unbios. By Federal law, this means Hillary Clinton is ineligible to run for President, according to 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2071(b), which states:‚ÄúWhoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.‚Äù
22 | Ray Headrick | 10155485796866509_1818741548411506 | I'm sorry I have to say this or I will go insane. I've been a very loyal CNN viewer for years. Since I've been 18 years old CNN has been my main news source. But over the course of this recent presidential race I've seen their true colors. They are the biggest Hillary supports and have been since the start. I find it sad and even disturbing that they are so left. I no longer will watch CNN because if they are not even. They are have sold out. The news is no longer news it's a campaign channel.
23 | Natalie Cespedes | 10155485796866509_10155485839156509 | ABC, CNN, etc etc they are ALL SHILLS for Clinton. You've lost respect from millions of viewers with your extreme bias and propaganda during this election.
24 | Sherrianne Bromley-McDonagh | 10155485796866509_1818731968412464 | HOW did Hillary win this debate tonight exactly??? I watched it and CLEARLY this poll was created before the debate even began. Typical Liberal biased, media-backed CNN at its finest. No wonder Trump continuously questions the integrity of the election process!! I think Trump handled himself quite well tonight while ALL Hillary did was avoid and deny issues that could hurt her campaign.
25 | Gary Kolgen | 10155485796866509_1429059133775392 | OH NO - they just did a live poll with undecided voters on CNN and guess what Trump won 10 to 5. So looks like it was Trump 67% to 33%.   CNN Commentators looked shocked and still said Hilary won that group as well.

3 | Dewey Spring | 10155485731071509_10155485847176509 | Unfortunately the only thing that we have excelled at was healthcare and computers since the Apollo Space program up into early 2000. After 2000 the only thing this country has done was create a war in Iraq and Afghanistan help the military industrial complex hurting and killing to many of our young men. The only other thing is about to crash the world economy from Mega Banks, inventmrnt bankers over extending and insurance company's to the big banks.

5 | Stephen Lyle | 10155485731071509_10155486106451509 | - That looks very impressive.. I'm not sure the American market can meet any standardized systems in the bikes for proper loading and unloading, I don't know how it works, how it hangs on the bike.. What if the  bike fell off the elevator, how long would that take ?. lol
6 | Eileen Tharp | 10155485731071509_10155485781511509 | Well all you libs who called me a liar when I said Hillary believes in abortion up to the day of birth, were you listening to this cold woman? If you can pull a baby out far enough to put a scissors or scalpel in its brain,which is what they do in partial birth abortions, then why can't you just take the baby  out and help it to live instead. This business of it's for the Mother's life is a joke. If you kill a baby the day before its birth date, how is that not the same as the day after? They are both viable and it's murder either way. She has no heart. And Black Lives Matter what about all the black babies aborted? Don't their little lives matter. You're giving liberals like Margaret Sanger (founder of Planned Parenthood) what she wanted, to control the growth of the black population. Look it up, she was a bigot, and now look at the millions of black babies killed in the name of "freedom.
7 | CB Mann | 10155485731071509_10155485781416509 | CNN should recuse themselves from this election. They are the 7th largest financial contributor to Clinton. 7th largest! They should make a public statement admitting they are pro Hillary, how much money they have donated (Millions) and that they can't be impartial because they are trying to get her elected. And it should be illegal to misrepresent themselves as a news organization when they are bought and paid for by the Democrats.
8 | Fred LC | 10155485731071509_10155485776456509 | Same place the CNN shills are burying any semblance of journalistic integrity, and the wikileaks document dumps. You people are a disgrace and a stain on this nation.

1 | Dustin Messner | 10155485697371509_10155485729246509 | Hey CNN you do really suck.. Our household doesn't usually watch msm, and I am glad we don't. It has been proven that Clinton pays you and orchestrates you on her segments that are on CNN. Turner/CNN also has donated $817K to her campaign. Let me tell you something it shows. We watched CNN for two minutes, and it is no wonder why people think Hillary will win this election. Brainwash beyond belief. No other news outlet is quite like you. Let me tell you something, when Hillary loses, I am going to turn you on our TV just to see your mouths drop with absolutely nothing to say! I'm sure the money is good, but good luck to your credibility come November 8th!
2 | Stefan Konstantopoulos | 10155485697371509_10155485718166509 | Hillary's performance was embarrassing tonight. She would have done better if she spoke offf the cuff, rather than just read from her prepared statement cards. It was obvious she needed the extra crutch. Without those cards, she would have been sweating bullets. At any rate, she failed to do what she needed to do. She will not win.
3 | Dianne Noche Atienza | 10155485697371509_10155485714756509 | With the 2 presidential candidates, only Hillary is qualified to be the president. She has the experience(both positive and negative) in governing the country. Everybody learns from their mistakes, including Donald Trump. But Trump's experience and mistakes (when corrected), is not really applicable in governing the country. Trumps have the experience in governing his business, he can use that in managing FOX Network. It will be a shame to the world if he use it in running the USA. #PresidentHillaryClinton

It's clear, so don't support CNN,abc, csnbc and the rest of the lies. In Indiana the Democrats have been cought changing Republican ballets to Democrat. The don't have a leg to stand on and they can't win fair. We all know trump has more supporters!! Trump2016

If you people out there truly want a man running this country that can't even say that he will accept the winner whoever it is, then people you have a rude awakening coming your way if he gets in!!!!!!
8 | Wilson Deronette | 10155485697371509_10155485729061509 | CNN is a network of educated liars and corrupted reporters. You are not a news network, you are a compromised experienced American network. You are making matters worst for the system.
9 | Todd Snarr | 10155485697371509_10155485701961509 | Donald Trump is not evil as described by Hilary Clinton, Democrats & these liberal news stations.They are all lying to you and some of you are falling for their lies.Being the owner of my S-Corp accounting business and the many years served with the Navy & IRS, Donald Trump is saying most everything correct. Do disagree on a couple of things, but most of it is true and correct for the "Real" Change needed for Our Country.If you buy into Hilary Clinton, like Obama, you are being deceived by many means.The stuff Hilary Clinton brought up regarding not paying taxes involves net operating losses carried back & then carried forward up to 20 years.&,Many people & businesses in our country to have these same tax benefits to claim losses. Hilary Clinton is a LIAR.I heard many lies from Hilary.Hilary Clinton, instead of answering the question given, turned away from it and tried to make up lies of Donald's character. This way Hilary Clinton doesn't have to answer the question.WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!
10 | Priscilla Nye | 10155485697371509_10155485822506509 | Are you serious CNN? You are as corrupt as Hillary Clinton!!! Trump said the elections are rigged and you are proof that they are! All you do is attack Trump.  You never say anything negative about the crooked Hillary.  We don't believe you CNN!!
11 | Ma Theresa D Shiver | 10155485697371509_10155485795881509 | Trump won the debate for giving honest, straight answers to ALL questions. Hillary was just very sleek to deflect, avoid and going around the bush with her answers. She did not give answers to some questions. Indeed a SEASONED POLITICIAN. ALL TALK!
12 | Sarah Stiegel | 10155485697371509_10155485717951509 | 8 Generations ago my direct relative, Col. Christopher Truby risked his life fighting the British in the American Revolution.  Today, nearly 240+ years later I find myself saddened by the state of our great country.  I have always felt pride being an American, a patriot, however at this time I'm almost embarrassed and most definitely saddened.  Our country has regressed 270+ years to a state where we need to overthrow our governing body.  Don't you remember learning in American history "no taxation without representation".?  Don't you remember the pride you felt learning how our founding fathers drafted such amazing documents like the Declaration of Independence and most importantly the Constitution of the United States?  Our fore-fathers died for those documents, those beliefs.  Now today 270+ years later our basic rights that we fought for are at stake and it sickens me to see how many people are willing to throw it all away.  This election isn't about taxes, immigration, or abortion, this election is about our basic American rights.  We are at risk of losing our guaranteed rights thanks to a corrupt woman and her ulterior motives.  I'm voting for America, for our founding fathers, for our Bill of Rights, for our Freedoms, for the best country in the world.  This isn't about race/ethnicity this is about US, as Americans, standing up for US, the greatest nation of the modern world.  We need to bring back unity, we need to be proud Americans.  It's time to stand up, with our right hand over our heart and proudly state "one God, indivisible, in liberty and justice for ALL".  Protect our America, our freedom.  Vote TRUMP 2016
13 | Melissa Ware | 10155485697371509_10155485835211509 | Horrifying? She must have short circuited and forgot about old Al Gore's stance that Florida was rigged and was given to Bush. He didn't graciously accept defeat nor did many Democrats, Why is it so horrifying to say, when we know what is actually going on.
14 | Loretta Reel | 10155485697371509_1011659842279874 | What is horrifying is Clinton supports partial birth abortion ripping babies apart fully formed. Even choice voters don't agree with her. Horrifying that her campaign paid to incite and create violence at Trump rallies, open borders and trading without regard to Americans, horrifying she refuses to return money she received from foreign countries who kill gays and lesbians, control, degrade, and take rights away from women, and take young girls as brides, to many things to mention. Just horrifying.
15 | Helen Beaty | 10155485697371509_10155485778881509 | I hope Hillary never has to encounter Trump again in her life. What a nasty horrible man. My respect  has gone up for her so much. I already voted for her earlier today...if I could vote again I would.
16 | John Vitali | 10155485697371509_10155485721661509 | Hillary won the debate! She's intelligent,competent and mentally tough to handle the stress of the Presidency.I voted for a woman running for US President for the first time!:)
17 | Marie Garner | 10155485697371509_10155485784241509 | Why are you brainwashing people its because you are owned by the democrats, just like the UK BBC is run by the government so we are not allowed to know what is really going on in our country.  Clinton is a warmonger and a liar but you are always on her side and you never say the bad things about her which she has done for instance Benghazi. All you ever do is come down on Trump but Clinton is a dangerous person for America and the world
18 | John Vitali | 10155485697371509_10155485817661509 | Hillary would NEVER intiate or plan violence at her oppositions rallies.That is just nonsense and sheer paranoia.This guy scares me.He seems unstable for the Presidency and I can see him crack if he became the POTUS.
19 | Dave Kennedy | 10155485697371509_10155485706806509 | If Hillary Clinton Dodges and pivot anymore she should be on Dancing With the StarsI'm glad he brought up these videos.A little bit more should of been saidhttps://milo.yiannopoulos.net/2016/10/blackout-okeefe-ignored-mainstream/
20 | Abby Fleischauer | 10155485697371509_10155485744126509 | Not on topic but the people yelling dumb stuff in the background during the pre & now post debate discussions are sooo annoying, how can you listen or even have a conversation. Now yelling Donald Trump, did he pay them to do this? 1 guy sounds so crazy , angry, & possibly drunk. It's ridiculous! I can't take much more of it
21 | Yolanda Antoine | 10155485697371509_10155485795876509 | It's amazing how Trump supporters can cry something is rigged, all of the people voting are democrats. Trump and his suppoters make more excuses  than a man on death row. So this tells us not only he will not accept a lose neither will his supporters.
22 | Fabian Sheppard | 10155485697371509_10155485731651509 | how come they never mention Jill Stein or Gary Johnson thats why people don't trust the media you guys act like there the only 2 candidates how about you talk more about jill and gary we the peoples sick of hearing about your 2 favorite candidates!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! p.s hillary stole from the white house on her way out during the end of bills term and had to return the goods!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
23 | Mark Culpepper | 10155485697371509_10155485796731509 | Such a load of crap - all this talk about the validity of the electoral process. Bottom line is that the Donald is a total sexist, racist, bigot - he is losing *everywhere* because he's a loser. He assaults women. He isolated latinos. Blacks. Muslims. Women. This has *nothing* to do with our electoral process. It has everything to do with Donald trying to change the discussion away from his failings, which are so numerous which he cannot possibly defend them. The man is a fool, an idiot, a liar and an entitled thief born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
24 | John Vitali | 10155485697371509_10155485796811509 | The elections rigged! Hahahaha.This guy is a psychotic narcissist just like Stillson.I have NEVER in my adult life ever hear from a major Presidential candidate EVER say the elections rigged.I've been voting since 1988.
25 | Wilma Col√≥n | 10155485697371509_1011658405613351 | You missed Hillary's Hilarious quote about Trump and his crocodile tears. And when Trump said he has not even apologized to his wife for the tape and all the accusations of sexual assault.

JUST IN: Hillary Clinton won the final presidential debate 52% to 39%, according to a CNN / ORC poll of debate watchers http://cnn.it/2e8faBX
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Matthew Nixon | 10155485573376509_10155485582081509 | CNN, your "news" network has turned into such a biased joke that fails to report real stories and facts to the public. The fact that you openly promote Clinton  while always bashing the other candidates goes to show the agenda and shameful efforts by this once great news organization.
2 | Harut Pogosyan | 10155485573376509_10155485575296509 | Go Hillary!! 3:0!! Bye, bye "NASTY" Trump!! #ImWithHer #StrongerTogether
3 | Justin Dancer | 10155485573376509_10155485587256509 | So 100% of the people who watched it say she won? I never did a poll. Plus most Hillary fans watch CNN. Just saying. #MediaBias
4 | Masum Ahmed | 10155485573376509_10155485582196509 | Trump said - in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb.‚Äù- But in reality Abortions do not happen at 9 months pregnant. there is no such thing as a nine month abortion.Trump said - We have some bad hombres and we're going to get them out.- He offended Hispanic people here againHe said - Such a nasty women to Hillary.- Wow! How come this guy said he has tremendous respect for Women.Finally Trump refused to say he would accept the result of next month's presidential election.-This is a big insult of American democracy.
5 | Jody Tarpening | 10155485573376509_10155485587966509 | I hope we don't vote for another polished politician! Obama sang the song to many and didn't follow through with any promises besides some healthcare dictionary that doesn't make sense to even the professionals! We can't vote for this woman! Please don't listen to the very biased media and do the research yourself! Media is a joke! We talk about several issues and on every single channel they want to replay the part where he said he would decide late on the support of the outcome of this election. Who gives a piss! I don't like losing either! I don't like trying to battle a candidate and the majority of every media outlet around! We are the puppets in this whole game! We listen to people on TV like it was GOD speaking to us directly! We listen to advice from celebrities and athletes as if they have every answer known to man! Heck we think actors that go on drunk binges do every drug known to man and beat their families are heroes when they seem to get their life back on track! Then we listen to what they would do or who they would vote for.. you have to be kidding me! We have taken GOD out of our lives and what do we do.... accept it! We are taking the sides of criminals over our trusted law enforcement and what do we do.... accept it! We are allowing men and women really to choose what bathroom to use on what ever day they feel like they most relate to and what do we do.... accept it! We allow people to burn our flags and be a role model kneeing for our national anthem what do we do... accept it! Now a school in South Carolina wants to remove the flag from the school because it offends people what do we do.... you got it.. accept it! We let 1000's of refugees into our country and give them more than we give our own.. that's ok we accept that too!I remember accepting that our idiot president Obama released known terrorist killers from our custody to free a soldier that he honored as a hero but ended up realizing the guy committed treason! What did we say to that... nothing we accepted it! Wake up! We have to change what direction this country is going or else our children and our children's children will be faced with something we can't even imagine! We have to stop looking the other way we have to stop accepting the actions of our government without putting up a fight! Vote for Hillary in November and it could be the nail in the coffin!
6 | Travis William Smith | 10155485573376509_10155485577796509 | Of course you would say that cnn..." This just in" you're all on crack
7 | Derek Sellers | 10155485573376509_1772877292975851 | Wait. CNN asked their viewers who won the debate, and people said Clinton?! I better switch over to Fox to see what they said. You all are sheep. Congrats
8 | Muhammad Sadiq | 10155485573376509_10155485579916509 | Hillary did an amazing job (yet again)! I love how you conduct yourself. You are definitely a classy, intelligent woman and I can't wait to see you elected November 8th! #ImWithHer
9 | Joaquin Valdez | 10155485573376509_10155485576486509 | Intellectually she won by a landslide. The baboon will not even accept defeat; how is that presidential, come on!
10 | Jennifer Spier | 10155485573376509_1808507859368383 | CNN is the most unreliable media outlet ever! Can't wait for trump to win and them actually have to report some real truths about him. It will be odd hearing them speak nice for once!
11 | Eric Sklar | 10155485573376509_1797127303877410 | Clinton News Network.... I'm not sure where you get your results from, Trump won hands down, she can't answer the Clinton Foundation accurately, avoided all of her emails from wikileaks and open boarder as it was for energy... put your Crack pipe down. She is by far the worst person to be a candidate for president and she should be in jail.
12 | Abhi Joshi | 10155485573376509_10155485591146509 | Trump lost badly, same old boring lines, rambling on points that make no sense. But I gotta give him credit for being entertaining, he was the butt of some very funny remarks. So long Putins Pumpkin Spice Puppet, back in your holes deplorables. Its over.
13 | Gargi Karmaker | 10155485573376509_10155485603271509 | Hillary won even in the 2nd debate too according to CNN when all other polls clearly showed Trump won....for only once CNN  mention the fact that they take the votes from registered democrats only  and next times never mention it ..so dishonest CNN..
14 | Giyoo Suswaram Higashide | 10155485573376509_1004061009704579 | this is a joke right? look at polls from everywhere...it's Trump that's winning the hearts of people in America. Even if Hillary walked in drunk, CNN would post that she won...because they would have generated the false polls even before the debate.
15 | Joshua Steventon | 10155485573376509_1797126620544145 | So when did CNN become the official winner declaring Network? I would like to see a poll from an independent news source. CNN has become nothing but the Clinton News Network, and I'm not even a Donald Trump supporter.
16 | Matthew Bunton | 10155485573376509_1772878856309028 | On the second debate, it took CNN 1.5 hrs to get results. Not it just took them only 30 min. CNN already new she lost. I hate mainstream media. Only Fox and one american news is for me. #CNNISBOUGHTOUT
17 | Shkel Kaba | 10155485573376509_720300281450567 | WOW a majority of the comments left on here all agree that CNN is biased and the after debate show was a joke. I hope the top executives at CNN are reading these comments. Your network has lost all journalistic integrity especially after this debate.
18 | Priscilla Nye | 10155485573376509_1798916336986938 | TRUMP did awesome tonight! Hildabeast either lied or totally ditched the questions!!! She looked terrible for not answering questions about all of her corrupt issues! She is the dangerous canidate! She does not take national security seriously! There is a  ton of proof that the election has been rigged on all levels and I'm proud of him for saying that he would see if he would support her if she won the election. Please God don't let her win! That will be the end of our freedoms and our country! #VOTE FOR TRUMP 2016
19 | Nick Parrett | 10155485573376509_1004056339705046 | After reading many, many, comments on this post, I would have to admit that I agree with a good majority of them. By the way, those were pro Trump comments. It doesn't take a genius to figure it out. CNN, you're pathetic!
20 | Jeffrey W White | 10155485573376509_10155485596241509 | How can someone running for President of this country get away with saying we have a democracy! News flash Mrs. Clinton, this is a CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC!!!!
21 | Vanessa Rutigliano | 10155485573376509_1808508522701650 | CNN = Clinton News Network. CNN, you should be ashamed. You're all a bunch of criminals. And Killary should be in prison.
22 | Macky Cosmos | 10155485573376509_10155485585691509 | Clearly the vile predator and Russian sympathizer/draft dodger lost this important debate and further proved his incompetence by refusing to acknowledge defeat should it come. I am truly feeling blessed to be alive and witnessing a woman ascend to the presidency as the gravity of this great accomplishment is immeasurably beautiful and not to mention, it is about time. #ImWithHer #HillaryClinton
23 | Stephen Saunders | 10155485573376509_1772886552974925 | There are millions of people who intend to vote for Trump who aren't voicing the fact for fear of needless confrontation.  On election day, however, their voices will ring the loudest.
24 | Rebekah Wagemann | 10155485573376509_553472358180665 | Hillary deserves to rot in prison. She does NOT support our military and supplies Isis with billions of dollars worth of weapons! #hillary4prison2016 üíÅüèºüíÖüèºüá∫üá∏ CNN is corrupt as well just like puppets. CNN is a joke. üòÇ

2 | Michael Spivey | 10155485535431509_10155485537706509 | Trump's refusal to accept a loss could incite violence on and after Election Day. It poisons our system of government. It divides people even further. Even the most well constructed republic relies on decorum and unwritten rules to survive. This man doesn't care. Everyone else in the GOP- everyone- must immediately accept the results to send a strong message
3 | Joyann Tinsel | 10155485535431509_10155485561031509 | Was undecided until tonight. Hillary Clinton never addressed any of the serious issues raised tonight. I'm happy that this debate seems so much more fair and now with the Forum that brought in the fairness my vote is going to Trump
4 | Bobby B. Bentley | 10155485535431509_10155485538656509 | Indeed, Saudi Arabia has donated up to $50 million to the Clinton Foundation, despite their horrid human rights. Qatar donated $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation despite Clinton being well aware of the country‚Äôs horrific record of violence against women.Fact-Check: TRUE
5 | Tammy Kirkpatrick-Driver | 10155485535431509_10155485571381509 | What's funny CNN is the fact your polls are off way off and all the other polls I see shows Trump is wayyyy up compared to Hillary ... No way Hillary is going to win... I truly believe the silent people of the lands will go vote and Trump will be President
6 | Sherry Vogt | 10155485535431509_10155485573386509 | she's already cheated bernie sanders..she's paid people to riot at rallys...her and Obama emailed back and forth so the FBI is protecting Obama and hillary...she's a liar...a cheater...she's taken money from Saudi Arabia and other countries. ..she thinks it's ok for full term abortions when there are many people that would adopt...im for a woman's right to choose but unless the mothers life really is at risk...im against a full term abortion...Google all the people that are dead because of them...Google julian assange of WikiLeaks. ...he's exposing them so his life is in danger....if trump wins his life will be in danger along with all American lives...I believe she is under mind control and unhealthy...we need a change....He stands up for himself and doesn't cave into conforming to what othere say
7 | Robert Neff | 10155485535431509_10155485551571509 | What makes Trump even more dangerous is the absurd amount of all the loonies supporting him with no regard to what he says or does.

11 | Patty McElhatton Lewis | 10155485535431509_10155485618376509 | Tell me why Hillary Clinton got away without answering questions that were given to her??Donald Trump answered the questions about the eight women that just in the last week ironically have come forward saying he had  kiss them or fondled them! And Hillary was supposed to address  her husband's affairs which were documented and he paid $850,000 to one girl to shut her mouth! She completely ignored answering that totally why is the media not talking about that right now!Donald Trump was the only one that  talked about our veterans? Men and women that fought for our country and are suffering with the worst medical care known to man! He mentioned illegal immigrants have got better healthcare than our veterans! Why isn't the media talking about that that he said? Hillary didn't even address our veterans!! Stop focusing on ONE thing Donald Trump said! Let's talk about what Hillary Clinton didn't answer the emails the videos the things that she said that came out in Wikipedia! And she thinks Donald trumps got the Russians against her!! Cut me a break she might as will just say the aliens are out for her too!And there's no doubt with these women coming forth in the last week against Donald Trump that definitely her campaign had something to do with it because she's got constant nasty commercials repeating over and over and over brainwashing people and children she says she's concerned about what children seeing what Trump says or does but she continues up show them these commercials over and over again!!
12 | Percy Naranjo | 10155485535431509_10155485629651509 | Accept the outcome of an election? when Hillary Clinton's definition of democracy is what she did to Bernie Sanders. Pardon Trump's extreme cynicism.
13 | Cindy Boggs | 10155485535431509_10155485581426509 | I just want to say, CNN used to be an actual news source, now it's nothing but a biased, piece of crap, propaganda site.  I'm unfollowing CNN....no, I'm not a trump fan, but this obviously one sided reporting from a supposed news site is a joke.
14 | Wen Wu | 10155485535431509_10155485583221509 | You are the most dangerous and corrupted presidential candidate in the whole history of man kind, Hillary! Hillary supporters are just blind at this point. How could anyone support her knowing all the lies and corruptions? Hillary is experienced in giving speeches to Wall Street companies and received $225000, $300000 per speech! Think about it: why would any company give anyone this amount of money unless they get something in returns? A vote for Hillary is a vote for corruption and this country will become the puppet of the world. How can someone in his/her right mind to support and vote for this corrupted individual is beyond my comprehension.
15 | Marsha Picton Weaver | 10155485535431509_10155485573481509 | She actually said that she is for killing a baby inside it's mothers womb even though it could survive an early delivery...any women that is ok with this is a disgrace.

17 | Gregory Hall | 10155485535431509_555620581305482 | Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:‚Äú(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.‚ÄùYes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us. Post this everywhere

How come when I'm out driving I see hundreds of trump signs all over the place and only a hand full of Hillary signs. Trump rallies have people waiting outside because they're sold out. Hillary doesn't fill the room. Who the hell are these people polling? They have not called me or anyone I know!Edit: And for all of you ignorant Hillary supporters saying I'm uneducated and live in a trailer park in the south, I live in a middle-upper class suburbs of Reading Pennsylvania(a normally blue State and area).

3 | Robert E. Jonas | 10155485495321509_10155485515561509 | Wait, wait wait... Hillary is all about saving 32,000 innocent toddler lives, but but but... she's all about aborting countless amounts of innocent babies?So, she wants to save lives, or end them? End Them.... She's on record that a baby is not alive even at 32 weeks, so its ok to kill them...My wife and i are expecting and she scares rhe Hell out of us!Major Robert Jonas,Ph.d
4 | Scott Burk | 10155485495321509_10155485519211509 | WOW, looks like someone opened the Trump nuthouse and let the crazies out. Thank you so much Van Jones for bringing us back to reality.
5 | Coty Hopkins | 10155485495321509_10155485519306509 | Haha!! The media is feeling the squeeze tonight. Their girl is on the ropes, and they are trying to spin her into a positive light.
6 | Darin RGra | 10155485495321509_10155485515571509 | Such a fake speech on Hillary's part. It is the same ole same ole. Improve lives of the middle class, the children, get jobs rolling again etc. They all have been saying it for years for the Presidential election Peanut Gallery but nothing worth noting for improvement. The only job rolling I see is rolling out of this country. Trump talks a different tone because he means what he says and is at the least being honest with us to the best of his ability for what he knows at this moment trying to fight through all of this muck that has been created. I don't think I would remark on what I would accept or not accept if I knew there was known corruption with what is supposes to be a fair and honest election. Why agree to losing due to criminal behavior. I wouldn't make that statement either at this moment. Hillary pretty said it at the end what she want to accomplish and that is "Make America Great Again" just in different words and almost sounded like she was going to say it.
7 | Donna Woolner | 10155485495321509_10155485524076509 | Van Jones wish he would shut up!!! Again CNN is soooo one sided. I would never trust anything they have to say.. Hillary is a killer , liar, email schemer and CNN has no problem with this . Very sad!!!
8 | Christine Mary | 10155485495321509_10155485525581509 | CNN. You're losing our viewership. This Jeffrey on your panel is another certified moron. Your blonde female supporter of Trump feels her outfit is proper for this? I don't think so.Different standards for the GOP.
9 | Kristine Bonilla-Dutra | 10155485495321509_10155485522931509 | Get off this issue CNN,   why don't you talk about all the other issues that were debated tonight like the economy,  Obama care, immigration ...omgSeriously, gee whiz
10 | Michael Jett | 10155485495321509_10155485523031509 | I think Van Jones should run for president, he is thoughtful, sincere and tells it like it is, plus hello you cant polish a turd is my new go to statement
11 | Todd Samuel | 10155485495321509_1161427887229756 | "Senator Clinton, please answer this question about the Clinton foundation" - clintons reponse "well you know Trump has no respect for woman" well done Hillary for not answering a single question as always
12 | Gina Marshall | 10155485495321509_1833167940259909 | Smartest man I have ever had the pleasure to listen to. Major respect for Van Jones. Hands down...the most rational, logical, fair-minded commentator I have ever heard speak. Kudos for his intelligence, poise, composure, and grace. Thank you for your sanity during all of the insanity of this election year! ‚ô°
13 | Ralph Olson | 10155485495321509_10155485523116509 | Van jones hit it dead on..he almost cried..because he knew democracy and freedom of america is at stake..but trumps "poorly educated" wont know that..how sad indeed..
14 | Taylor Na'Chelle | 10155485495321509_1161437123895499 | Hillary should start preparing her Presidential acceptance speech. Because I don't see how anyone can take Trump seriously. He has managed to offend the LGBT community, the female race, minorities, those with mental illness, the families of troops who have served and died, and the list goes on and on. #DumpTrump
15 | Nathalie Ben Kely-Scott | 10155485495321509_10155485522796509 | Let's see 6 of you Clinton supporters at that table and 2 trump supporters!!!??? That's very fair and unbiased!!!!???? How can we make up our minds on whom to vote for when you media hacks try to choose for us!!!?
16 | Dave Bartlett | 10155485495321509_10155485530256509 | Obviously this Turd running his mouth is clearly out to bash Trump. He apparently has overlooked many of Clinton's actions and comments. Maybe this Turd should seek getting himself polished 1st
17 | Timothy Adam Luke Godkin | 10155485495321509_10155485547161509 | Actually, Anderson Cooper; turds can be polished. MythBusters tested the saying and proved it's possible to polish lion poop and a couple of others. We get the point you were trying to make though, which is 100% on point in this case LOL.
18 | Judi Arbogast | 10155485495321509_10155485516291509 | Gore questioned the results of the election for weeks and questions it to this day! What about that? Discussion please!
19 | Lee Beard | 10155485495321509_1161432733895938 | He should not except it, and neither should any American. Killary should not even be speaking at podium the fact that she is just shows how bad our corruption problem is. Anyone else would be in prison but if your a Clinton then you are above the law! I know what most of you are thinking, (Clinton News Network) "what difference does it make", right? Troop Lives Matter!
20 | Dan Strother | 10155485495321509_991988297578378 | So I will say it because everyone else is scared. Does this remind ANYONE of Germany and a man named Adolf? Trump is a narcissistic power play. If you can't see it, you are blinded by hate.
21 | Josh Lewellen | 10155485495321509_1833167953593241 | I had to change the channel on these dip-shits. Nothing but a bunch of Hillary Clinton supporters! CNN has rigged the elections here, folks. #JL
22 | Doug Saylor | 10155485495321509_10155485534946509 | And of course #CNN will spend the next 2 weeks talking about him not accepting election results rather than the economy, healthcare, foreign policy, tax plans, etc. Our news has turned into a joke.
23 | Derek Brothers | 10155485495321509_991988054245069 | Van Jones is a disgrace to the black race. I've been watching CNN the last couple months and it seems to me he is paid to put down trump. You are a disgrace to the black race. You are full of it
24 | Babbie Stephenson Peters | 10155485495321509_10155485542781509 | thank god for Van Jones, the only one who spoke the truth about the spoiled brat antics that the bully trump displayed at the debate. I can't wait for the CNN skit on SNL this weekend.
25 | Tammy Mccoy | 10155485495321509_991993517577856 | The Democrats are on tape talking about corrupting the elections-inciting riots in Chicago etc --the FBI allowed Clinton staff to destroy lap tops--Bill meets secretly with AG--- Note to Van Jones----the people feel this government --you in the media etc are corrupt---

Donald J. Trump refuses to say he would accept the result of next month's presidential election http://cnn.it/2evJULz
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Violet Sanchez | 10155485471566509_10155485481356509 | Of course he'll keep it in suspense,  if he wins, he will say that everything was right and honest,  but if he lose he will cry like a cry baby he is claiming of a rigged election... he's so predictable and pathetic
2 | Alexis Gonzalez | 10155485471566509_10155485475631509 | I just looked at about ten different polls on who won the debate tonight. The ones that said Clinton had won were already closed. The polls that were still open had overwhelming votes for Trump, and they were still pouring in. Hmmmm ü§îü§îü§î
3 | Jason Bover | 10155485471566509_10155485477711509 | WikiLeaks has already proven the primaries against Bernie were rigged. Why the hell would Trump believe the election would be any different?
4 | Eric Yourchisin | 10155485471566509_10155485476931509 | Yawn... Come on CNN i know you can do it.... Call out Hillary on something... Just one thing... A hair out of place... Or she sniffed .. Just something..
5 | Sean Warren | 10155485471566509_10155485475346509 | Ok this isn't funny anymore, where are the real candidates??? Because I swear we're all on one long episode of Punk'd, and we're just waiting for Ashton Kutcher to come out and dupe us all...smh
6 | Kyle Switzer | 10155485471566509_10155485486291509 | How exactly did he refuse to answer the question? He said he would at the appropriate time after the election. With everything that Hillary's campaign is doing, he was well with in his rights.
7 | Gabriel Thomas | 10155485471566509_10155485476481509 | this is the best slogan for Trump so far. I can't help but give Trump credit for single-handedly destroyed the GOP and turned it into the PGP (P***y Grabbing Party). Bravo for that. You succeeded where the Dems have failed to do for decades.üëçüèªüëçüèªüôèüèª
8 | Tommy Carter | 10155485471566509_10155485493111509 | Trump I will not go gentle into that dark night . Thank you Mr. Trump for saying what 200 million of us are thinking, I will not surrender to the rule of this crooked women   . Win, lose or draw this election is like flight 93 we have no choice but to fight because under Hilary's rule we will all die anyway . I could hear the 2nd amendment people saying from my cold dead hands . This trying to hold on for another 4 years of this evil crap is just too unthinkable to even be considered now so I will let you know is a great answer .
9 | Kov Japiassu | 10155485471566509_10155485489166509 | Trump is definitely someone you can't take seriously.... he can't even answer a single question, of course that if nothing goes in his favor then it's automatically rigged... seems like he's just trying to promote his next reality show!
10 | Milton Cosby | 10155485471566509_10155485490341509 | If the election process is rigged than there is no integrity in the process. Trump is competing against people that for thirty, or more years have shown to the America people that they have no integrity. If he lose the election, I can understand him leading a revolt. Our Founding Fathers said, a little revolt is healthy for a democratic society. We are long over due.
11 | Allison Howze | 10155485471566509_10155485490231509 | My absolute favorite thing said about tonight's disgrace of a debate was so perfectly put by CNN's Van Jones..."You can't polish a turd." Such a very very sad but true reference to this election. ü§î
12 | Julie Packer Vergari | 10155485471566509_1784321495158708 | Well if Hillary wins, it'll be at least another 4 years where my husband and I will struggle and struggle - bringing home less and less. These democrats do NOTHING for the lower middle class!
13 | Robert Brown | 10155485471566509_10155485476426509 | I give Wallace a 4 out of 10. He ask Trump about the lying Women but never ask Hillary about her Raping Husband. just say No to Say NO to Hillary Clinton for president and YES to Donald Trump For President Great job on the Debate Mr. Trump you knocked it out of the ball park.
14 | Shandy Elliott | 10155485471566509_10155485502461509 | And WHO would claim to accept something that is IN THE FUTURE especially where there is so many RECENT controversies against Hillary?Seriously, if you were in his position, you can't possibly say that you would simply accept the results when you have black and white proof that "something" is going on.
15 | Amy Heustis Mathews | 10155485471566509_1784319448492246 | Because if he wins, it is all good. If he loses, It was rigged. Just like a spoiled rich kid whose daddy gave him every thing he wanted, he doesn't accept NO for an answer.
16 | Jessica Russo Miller | 10155485471566509_1784308541826670 | STOP highlighting this, unless it's to highlight that it's the worst question ever asked at a debate! Neither of them will genuinely support each other. He didn't say either way, she went on to make it dramatic saying how horrifying it was, yet she never answered if she would support a Trump win. Worst question - waste of time and media
17 | Zoe Kaiser | 10155485471566509_10155485482521509 | I'm going to say it again...Just want to point out that Clinton JUST TOLD THE WORLD OUR NUCLEAR RESPONSE TIME. Yeah. She'd keep us real safe. She really is bad at holding classified information.
18 | Deanna Wickey | 10155485471566509_1834243526809538 | CNN really trump was fantastic and you were just as fantastic at sucking as you always do!  You could only find a needle in a hay stack too Ask him to make a decision before the election.  Why would he!   I give him credit for what he said and I think you guys are idiots for expecting him to answer a question in Advance with everything that has been happening to him especially all the media fraud,  rally's, being set up with with disrupters, his campaigns facilities bringing violated, etc. so really you guys suck once again!
19 | Jean-francois Lazarides | 10155485471566509_1241383569261540 | Trump is just such an uninformed blowhard, and she is a diplomat. I don't like a majority of her policies...but I trust her going to China, or Israel, or nations of our allies, etc. and being calm, cool and collected and not offending someone or flying off the handle.
20 | Don Poyas | 10155485471566509_10155485495416509 | Chris Wallace didn't ask about ObamaCare, law and order, the inner cities, school vouchers, FBI quid pro quo, sanctuary cities, Benghazi. Stop dithering over whether Trump wants to support Clinton. Al Gore sued when he lost! Trump wins our vote.
21 | Emerson Williams | 10155485471566509_1834245640142660 | Hillary has the FBI, DOJ, several journalist, Mark Zuckerberg, Google, and many others in her pocket but you still don't believe the system is rigged?? Ask Bernie Sanders. #wikileaks
22 | Anna Fernandes | 10155485471566509_10155485493231509 | I have NEVER heard any politicians around the entire world say "I'll keep you in suspense." for an any elections!!! How do you earn the Trust & Respect from your own Americans and people living in America by this Man.. It is so Hurting for the things he has already said to the Americans!!! Especially to the people who have come to America..(*For your Kind information) FYKI Donald: America is the Land of the immigrants!!! Go figure that out!!! :-)
23 | Tracee Foster | 10155485471566509_10155485500666509 | I was old enough and remember this, Al Gore refused to except the out come of the elecrion in 2000.On November 7, 2000, projections indicated that Gore's opponent, George W. Bush, had narrowly won the election. Gore won the national popular vote but lost the electoral college vote after a bitter legal battle over disputed vote counts in the state of Florida. Bush won the election on the electoral college vote of 271 to 266. One elector pledged to Gore did not cast an electoral vote; Gore received 267 pledged electors. The election was one of the most controversial in American history.[1][2]
24 | Rafiu Adenopo | 10155485471566509_1241383115928252 | Truth be told, if I am an American, I will vote Donald Trump because he will make American great and if am not an American I will vote hillary Clinton because she will give foreigners opportunity to survive at the expense of Americans. I think tonight debate Trump did a very good job! I just like the man. He is blunt, funny, intelligent, smart and bold. Good luck America! Whoever wins, it is their problem bcos Nigeria is my home and I have no intention of travelling to America to live their. God bless Nigeria and America.
25 | Anna Jones | 10155485471566509_10155485484636509 | CNN GET OFF Donald said he is "not going to accept the process" It is pointless! You are going to Drive his base and turn us educated, can think for ourselves, watched this entire political candidate down to these two, who are smart enough and politically, socially, economically consciences to vote for Hillary. Move on to a better debate fight. Not accepting. It sounds like you're trying to force him and the American People into a matter that "matters, but does not matter at this point." There's plenty of BS Trump is totally ignorant about and Hillary is knowledgeable about that can continue this conversation about this final debate.

1 | Alex E Andrade | 10155485343041509_10155485410126509 | Undocumented immigrants pay more taxes than Donald Trump plus a lot of them bring fresh vegetable and cheap food to american tables.. Hillary President !!
2 | Chris Switzer | 10155485343041509_10155485408496509 | After tonight, may the deplorable and gutter dwellers known as the trump turds, be forever flushed back down to the sewers where they belong.
3 | Dianne Noche Atienza | 10155485343041509_10155485408676509 | With the 2 presidential candidates, only Hillary is qualified to be the president. She has the experience(both positive and negative) in governing the country. Everybody learns from their mistakes, including Donald Trump. But Trump's experience and mistakes (when corrected), is not really applicable in governing the country. Trumps have the experience in governing his business, he can use that in managing FOX Network. It will be a shame to the world if he use it in running the USA. #PresidentHillaryClinton
4 | Mateo Horhay | 10155485343041509_10155485408011509 | Before the comments get too nasty. Here is a positive one. I hope the remainder of your week is a great one. God bless you. God bless everyone. God bless America!
5 | Ugwu Kristian | 10155485343041509_10155485414216509 | I'm with her, She is fit, Donald J. Trump is the one who lacks Stamina, Did anyone else see how he was drinking a glass of water just to stay alive like a fish that got out of water, #ImWithHer.
6 | Josh Lewellen | 10155485343041509_10155485422216509 | CNN is nothing but a joke. Clearly it's a democratic station. The majority of news anchors support Hillary. CNN is the laughing stock of all news channels. Their news reporters are complete idiots, they don't go off of facts, they go off of social media. #JL
7 | Mark Sproles | 10155485343041509_10155485425461509 | I had to turn off CNN. The biased pro Hillary crap is too much. These are NOT reporters. I know why it's called the Clinton News Network. I'll be deleting your app as of now on every device.
8 | Wilma Col√≥n | 10155485343041509_10155485424786509 | There are bad hombres out there but on TV tonight I saw a nasty womanizer who cries crocodile tears because everything is rigged. A real life puppet! #floridawithHillary

10 | John Mckinnon | 10155485343041509_10155485413526509 | I FIND IT APPALLING That Liberals want to quote 17 intelligence agencies blame Russia for the hacks......US doesn't have 17 agencies for 1 and 2 they quote agencies when it benefits them and ignore them when it doesn't like when all the agencies stated IT WOULD BE A DANGER TO AMERICAN LIVES to bring refugees into america. Hypocrites
11 | Rachel Campbell | 10155485343041509_10155485438861509 | He just had to say it in that manner which is so tasteless. What Donald Trump fails to realize is that the minorities are becoming the majority and so pandering to just white uneducated people will no longer work!
12 | Claudia Gonzalez | 10155485343041509_1755687891372422 | Its okay for his kind to speak Spanish just to make fun of my Latin American brothers and sisters but when we speak our native Spanish language we get persecuted or harassed at. He and his kind are a piece of SH*T!
13 | Barry Smith | 10155485343041509_10155485418836509 | Hilary...free college, no tax raise, raise minimum wage, make all illegal aliens legal without question.Who is going to PAY for that????Too good to be true! See the light people!
14 | Giancarlo Felipa | 10155485343041509_10155485417891509 | The reason Donald Trump did not agree to accept the outcome of the election. It's because all the theifth the Democrats have done. Plus he flat out won the debate. So many questions she didn't want to answer.
15 | Dego Racer | 10155485343041509_10155485415646509 | Everyone I see bashing Trump but look at politics on a whole over the world people. The sweet talking and calm is always the dangerous one trust me. Like all politicians, they talk talk talk, promise you stuff and nothing is done. Those two may not be qualified overall based on reports but I believe Trump can try a thing or two to make America great if you allow him to. He is not like all politicians where they talk nice but tell the truth as it is and that's what hurting most a ya'll smh.
16 | Jeff Shaw | 10155485343041509_10155485416881509 | Was Clint Eastwood preparing Trump for the debate? This line could be from one of his westerns. "Let's get on our horses pardner and run down those bad hombres."
17 | Allison Howze | 10155485343041509_10155485442281509 | My absolute favorite thing said about tonight's disgrace of a debate was so perfectly put by CNN's Van Jones..."You can't polish a turd." Such a very very sad but true reference to this election. ü§î
18 | Bob Smith | 10155485343041509_1755678598040018 | Donald you're right, we're going to get them all out....out of the Senate and the House, kick all those bad hombres out and turn Congress Blue......and you're incompetence is leading us toward that goal.
19 | Linda Bowles | 10155485343041509_10155485428241509 | She said 90 % of the Clinton Foundation goes to charity, that is a lie. She is not fit to be President. The one job of the federal government is to protect America. By using the server for her job she failed at National security. Don't matter who shared the emails, she still broke the law.
20 | Lucia Rojas | 10155485343041509_10155485436656509 | Please...kick the cartel out of my back yard, future President Trump üá∫üá∏üëçüèº a lot of these fucktards have never lived in a border town or understand how EASY it has been to get drugs through the border.
21 | Nicky Diamond-Teague | 10155485343041509_1156171754468980 | Hombres wasn't taken of context as 'politically correct' it's wrong and equivalent to subjective groups such as saying get those 'blacks, Jews (or even Hebrews if you wanna talk language like he did), Muslims, Christians, dark skins, white skinned, Indians, rednecks, retards, etc.' You just can't use bigoted language like that. It's immoral and discussing and UNAMERICAN. This whole country is founded on immigrants and we are all immigrants. To demean people is not just non presidential, it's inhumane.
22 | Elada Sanders | 10155485343041509_10155485421071509 | Great job Trump; to bad she didn't answer for Wikileaks's .The transgressions against he husband mistresses and how sHE acted towards those ladies !!!
23 | Michael Wolfe | 10155485343041509_10155485422796509 | Something not right with her. Trump brings up violence ( video evidence proves her and Obama had ties too) her campaign help create at his events. 3 minutes later she says he causes violence at his events??? Lady what the hell is wrong with you. It's like Southpark where she can't get out of her own way.

Generate jobs, protect our borders and keep the 2nd Amendment intact. How could anyone support Hilldog? Deleting 33,000 emails after being subpoenaed,  proposing to grant amnesty to tens of thousands of illegal immigrants while having open borders, pay to play, the Clinton Slushfund, the slew of wikileaks scandals all while having a history of political failures.
