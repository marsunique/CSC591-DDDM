Agents will look at the time frame when Hillary Clinton was in office, but may include some of the time after she left office, according to sources.

This vague letter changes nothing. The GOP is on a wild goose chase to try to deflect off their sexual predator of a candidate. I trust Hillary more with emails than I do Trump with the nuclear codes.

Hillary is running for the highest position in the country, arguably, the world, and yet she knowingly received questions prior to her debates and suggestions on how she should answer. Wouldn't we reasonably expect the leader of the free world to be held to at least the same standards as a 17 year old plebe? What does it say about her that she accepted the questions and answers before the debates? Even more important, what does it say about anyone who still supports her?

11 | Gene Smith | 0 | 10154964792013812_10154964814368812 | There is no one to blame but Hillary Clinton for this mess. She took it upon herself to put an unsecure server in the basement of her house, received and sent classified email (according to FBI) thru that server, she destroyed her emails after they were subpoenaed by congress and she lied to congress while under oath about the emails. This was said during President Clinton’s impeachment trial by a Senator: “We have reduced lying under oath to a breach of etiquette”. Nothing has changed for the Clinton’s. They both lied under oath.

20 | Marc Langsam | 0 | 10154964792013812_10154964809573812 | “Malicious intent” is not required to break the law in Hillary Clinton’s case.There’s a new trend in the mainstream media’s ongoing efforts to defend Hillary Clinton over her email scandal and you should be keeping your eyes open for more of it in the future. When the question first came up, most liberal outlets went through the usual stages of denial and accommodation. Initially it was all just some story cooked up by the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy. Then, when the private bathroom server turned out to be a reality which could no longer be denied, the story was that it was simply personal information or routine business with her staff, along with Chelsea’s wedding and baby shower plans which were none of our business. We all saw how the story morphed from that point on until it was painfully obvious that there had been Top Secret material left lying around on the server outside the control of the government.So what’s the new approach to ensure that none of this could possibly indicate anything negative about the presumptive Democratic nominee? Well… even if she shouldn’t have done it, there clearly wasn’t any “malicious intent” on her part, as per the Washington Post. (Emphasis added)Officials: Scant evidence that Clinton had malicious intent in handling of emailsProsecutors and FBI agents investigating Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email server have so far found scant evidence that the leading Democratic presidential candidate intended to break classification rules, though they are still probing the case aggressively with an eye on interviewing Clinton herself, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter…he involvement of the U.S. Attorney’s Office is not indicative that charges are imminent or even likely. One official said prosecutors are wrestling with the question of whether Clinton intended to violate the rules, and so far, the evidence seemed to indicate she did not.Those are the leading descriptors in a piece which includes other information indicating that Clinton is facing serious jeopardy and it’s likely to be the ongoing theme from those seeking to make this story go away. Even if the laws were broken and intelligence data was either compromised or exposed to potential hacking, there’s really nothing to see here because, you guys… she didn’t mean for it to happen.Unfortunately for Ms. Clinton and her apologists, her allegedly harmless intentions have nothing to so with it. We previously discussed the actual charges which Clinton could face, and intent doesn’t factor into the law. Here’s a brief reminder.The applicable statute, 18 USC 793, however, does not even once mention the word “classified.” The focus is on “information respecting the national defense” that potentially “could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation.” 793 (f) specifically makes it a crime for anyone “entrusted with … any document … or information relating to the national defense … through gross negligence (to permit) the same to be removed from its proper place of custody.” A jury (not a Democrat or Republican political administration) is, of course, the best body to determine gross negligence on the facts of this case.The courts have held repeatedly that “national defense information” includes closely held military, foreign policy and intelligence information and that evidence that the information is classified is not necessary for a prosecution. Evidence that the information was upon later review found to be classified, however, as is the case with approximately 2,000 Clinton messages, is of course one kind of proof that the information met the test of “national defense information” in the first place.So even if Hillary Clinton never “intended” for sensitive information to be exposed, keeping it outside of the normal storage and safeguards of the government is more than sufficient for a case to be prosecuted. But the fundamental premise of saying there was no malicious intent is still dishonest in and of itself. Whether she cared for it or not, Secretary Clinton was aware that there was a State Department email system in place and available for her use. When your employer provides such a communication system for the employees it requires an active decision on the part of the employee to go out and hire people to set up a completely independent server in their home and keep it’s contents away from the prying eyes of the public. If she had restricted her use of that server to nothing but personal correspondence with friends and family it would still have raised some eyebrows but I believe she’d get a pass on the entire malicious intent question, but that’s not even remotely what happened. She was intentionally doing public business on her private server and it doesn’t require a psychic to figure out why. She didn’t want the public or the press to know about it or have any traceable records.Still, as I referenced above, that’s not the question at hand. The lack of intent line is just a red herring. Prosecution under 18 USC 793 only requires that the information wind up being outside of its proper place of custody. You can argue the intent angle all the live long day but it doesn’t change the fact that the law clearly appears to have been broken. Whether the Justice Department (under the thumb of one of Clinton’s biggest campaign surrogates) decides to do anything about it is another story.

Democrats in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona are accusing Republicans and Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign of conspiring to intimidate voters just days ahead of the election.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Gary Cozart | 434 | 10154964551408812_10154964562933812 | Are they planning on blocking highways, burning flags, and chasing them down and beating them?You know, like Hillary's thugs were paid to do.
2 | Christopher Umphress | 232 | 10154964551408812_10154964556423812 | Whatever Hillary is the one that is having her supporters firebomb places.
3 | Elliot Osher | 172 | 10154964551408812_10154964563843812 | You would really have to be insane to believe anything from the mainstream media... you'd have to be brain dead to vote for Hillary! You can't outrun the avalanche that is coming! Hillary supporters remind me of the violin players on the titanic all 4 of them going down with a sinking ship!
4 | Thor Allen | 67 | 10154964551408812_10154964574533812 | They are the ones responsible for 99.9 percent of the violence.  They didnt intimidate us, so now they feel intimidated? lol.  Now THAT is something only a democrat would try to pull off.
5 | Nader Adel | 92 | 10154964551408812_10154964560863812 | How ?? How can you intimidate people when they close the curtain and vote. I am a minority and there were couple observers. But they didn't intimidate me. Who do you think we are ???? A bunch wusses
6 | Dale Miller | 71 | 10154964551408812_10154964595608812 | THIS JUST IN!!! Clinton is now leading in the polls in key battleground states such as Qatar, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Syria and hopefully soon San Quentin
7 | Jacob Dabkiewicz | 43 | 10154964551408812_10154964588193812 | LMAO! Of course they would say that, they're desperate because they see Hillary's landslide loss on the horizon.Go ahead and cry in your 'safe space' ; just remember that you still need to vote on November 9th my Democrat friends.
8 | Marie Tat | 31 | 10154964551408812_10154964601108812 | First off they would stop those causing trouble at polling locations and secondly, Democrats have been violent and harassing Trump supporters for months. I don't believe the media b.s.
9 | LeAnn Larsen-Johnston | 21 | 10154964551408812_10154964593373812 | Any citizen in my town can go to a polling place and be an observer! This is another Democratic Clinton Lie! Republicans aren't like the New a Black Panthers, that were intimidating at the polling places! Notice it's all swing states!
10 | Bettie Duncan | 13 | 10154964551408812_10154964595633812 | LOL .... Hillary's campaign incites violence at Trump's rallies and Trump intimidates Hillary's voters. This is like a fight between two little kids. I am praying that the Russians hurry up and show us prove that Clinton and Trump planned these shenanigans from the get go and hopefully we can get rid of both of them!!
11 | Justin Joseph | 9 | 10154964551408812_10154964630888812 | I guess they forget about the black plant Panthers standing outside of Republican voting booth when Obama was going to be elected or Chicago when the thugs stormed the streets to stop a rally
12 | Patrick Neilan | 4 | 10154964551408812_10154964648103812 | Christopher Umphress" Are you crazy' Don't lie to American people' all has been caused by Devil Donald Trump this has been proven" anyway Hillary Clinton will be your next President of America and Devil Donald Trump will be in Prison for rape
13 | Bruce Templeman | 17 | 10154964551408812_10154964576403812 | With the 1st Amendment in play, there is no safe space for the little snowflakes to get away from listening to the other side. They're just going to have to suck it up and listen to trigger words like freedom, liberty, Trump, capitalism, etc...
14 | Rebekah Smith | 12 | 10154964551408812_10154964582953812 | I think I can safely speak on behalf of a great number of Democrats in saying nothing short of a gun to my head could intimidate me into voting Trump.
15 | Edwardo Encarnacion | 18 | 10154964551408812_10154964575733812 | Can we all agree that Democrats are the biggest damn babies out there? You people cry about everything if it's not in your favor. I can't wait until Hillary loses this election and we can shut you hypocritical asshats up for awhile.
16 | Patrick Neilan | 1 | 10154964551408812_10154964628868812 | Gary Cozart, you heard the wrong things what Hillary Clinton will do, Hilary Clinton would never do what you are thinking " Now Devil Donald Trump 95 % has done to wreck parts of America if he lose or wins
17 | Calvin Anderson | 0 | 10154964551408812_10154964723628812 | Where's the director of the FBI Donald Trump's people are breaking the law but they will not be able to stop us from voting. You will have to bring some of the boys out and every state we outnumber them and we can vote they can't stop us now we're mad we're going to come out and big numbers

19 | Crystal Mexico | 4 | 10154964551408812_10154964730008812 | Ya know, I continue to read these awful stories on my news feed about Trump supporters this and Hillary supporters that. For those of you blaming the other side for intolerance and how "horrible they are"......Newsflash: ALL of you who are pointing fingers and bashing the other are no better than your candidates' opponent. No joke. The media and these clowns (aka politicians) have done nothing but pulled everyone's strings. It's so sad to see so many people being so nasty to one another. We need UNITY in this country, but BOTH SIDES continue to play you all. Get a grip, stop playing into the hype and do a little research instead of just dancing like a bunch of puppets to the sound of the media. *Smh* Hillary AND Trump supporters (while a small percentage on each side have logic and decent reasoning) most of you are an absolute embarrassment to your party, your country and your fellow man. And what's worse, is that you continue to blame and point fingers at the other side.....for what you yourself continue to do. It's like watching my teenagers go at it, without a shred of common sense, or listening to each other. Bickering back and forth. Know what happens? No resolution and you both are still pissed off at the world and everything/everyone in it. Want to see Change? BE the change you want to see. Stop waiting for a single politician to hand it to you. It's freakin' ridiculous. And you call yourselves adults. Way to pave the way and set examples for the youth of today. They're already about 75% screwed up as it is........how about you salvage the 25% and start working towards helping them rather than furthering this nonsense. Grief!
20 | Lisa Traugott Wade | 4 | 10154964551408812_10154964642768812 | They ought to know about intimidation! They have been doing it every time you turn around. Parading those women up that say Trump groped and abused them, sending paid people to disrupt the Trump rallies... they know all about doing underhanded things. Hillary is upset that it was made public and s thought she had gotten away again with her illegal activities.
21 | Donald Wilson | 2 | 10154964551408812_10154964711358812 | Informing people that veteran fraud is a possibility and to keep your eyes open and make sure your vote goes to the person you want it to isn't a threat. Unless your saying vigilant people threaten to vote responsable against hillary.
22 | Lynn Perre | 6 | 10154964551408812_10154964686103812 | But it was ok for the NAACP and Black Panthers to stand outside polling places in 2008 and 2012 holding billy clubs, right????  WHAT A BUNCH OF HYPOCRITES!!  They are just pissed that they might not get away with stealing the election!!!!
23 | Scott Blair | 5 | 10154964551408812_10154964717453812 | The Dems are afraid that they will not be able to rig the election if people are asking questions and taking notes to compare with! SMDH!!!
24 | Peggy Joiner Gaston | 1 | 10154964551408812_10154964760968812 | Bunch of bull. Hillary has done this to herself. Look at all trump has gone through in last 18 months. You have known about Hillary for 30 damn years!

Ehlena Fry, a 12-year-old Michigan girl with cerebral palsy, has been at odds for years with her former school over the use of her service dog, Wonder. Monday, her case made its way to the Supreme Court.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Melinda Emerson | 87 | 10154964451303812_10154964478163812 | It should NEVER have gotten to the Supreme Court!!!  If a DISABLED person has a SERVICE DOG, they should be ALLOWED to bring the Service Dog with them to the school or ANYWHERE!!!  By NOT allowing the Service Dog in the school that is BLATANT DISCRIMINATION and goes AGAINST the Person with Disabilities Act...plain and simple!!!!
2 | Samuel Gonzalez | 35 | 10154964451303812_10154964473388812 | It should have never gone that far to begin with. She NEEDS a service dog to help her it's very clear and obvious. Unless you constantly run around in underwear wearing a tinfoil hat watching Fox News or you are voting for trump then you are probably a POS, so pathetic and ignorant that you probably should go back under a rock and be crushed by sludge hammer O_O
3 | Jennifer Hayes | 21 | 10154964451303812_10154964487833812 | There never even should have been an issue. While the school may have provided a human aide, that doesn't mean she didn't need her dog.  The dog provides more than just doing things. They provide comfort and stability as well as continuity to her daily routine. Bonds between the person and dog are very strong and also need to be reinforced and worked on every day. Especially when the child is young.
4 | Deepa Arun | 8 | 10154964451303812_10154964510603812 | Service dogs are there for a reason and if he's needed for her daily life then she needs to have him. He's a working dog and needs to be treated as such. Ridiculous that her school should not let her have her dog!
5 | Donald Webb | 6 | 10154964451303812_10154964508158812 | One wonders if the school were worried the dog might be a distraction to other students.  If the school provided a human aid to do the job of the dog, what was the problem?  I know she likes and loves the dog, but the school was willing to accommodate her without the dog.
6 | Lori Chapman-stinnett | 1 | 10154964451303812_10154964722563812 | I think some of these people who commented, didn't read the whole story.. Yes, at first they denied the service dog, but after the second ruling, they Allowed the dog... The Parents pulled her out of school, figuring the school would discriminate or bully the daughter if she went to the school. The other two courts, dismissed the case because the parents Didn't go through the complete process and be completely denied, they skipped that part and went to court for Money.. It no longer has Anything to do with the service dog... It's about Money
7 | Shannan Carothers | 0 | 10154964451303812_10154964774133812 | The family should have demanded a due process hearing before going to court. The district court was correct. This service animal doesn't appeared to be a certified service dog. There are differnt level of service dogs. To be in school and all public places need the same training and certification as a seeing eye dog.
8 | Kirt Harris | 0 | 10154964451303812_10154964487263812 | - I think you should have SOME consideration for your surroundings with your service dog.. WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE, is does something STOP YOU from living your normal life or doing what you need to provide for yourself..
9 | Kevin Notbusch | 2 | 10154964451303812_10154964478693812 | WHY? RUKM right now, If she needs a service dog, That over rides any rules or regulations... Stupid to fight this. Its a given, There should of been no question... :-!
10 | Sierra Mae | 1 | 10154964451303812_10154964672958812 | SO, the district finally said YES after that 2nd court!! And the parents decided to pull her from that school, bc they felt the administration might be hostile toward her. So they pulled her out and sued them instead. They should have sent her to school with the dog that was then permitted. Unreal.
11 | Gerald Haus | 2 | 10154964451303812_10154964534903812 | leave the kid alone, she has to live with cp 24 hours a day, give her 10 dogs if she wants them, quit being a bunch of political a$$holes.

15 | Krista MacLeod | 5 | 10154964451303812_10154964479928812 | If the dog is certified and trained, what is the problem?
16 | Elaine M. Blasgen | 0 | 10154964451303812_10154964675818812 | Thus should never have had to come up. If someone needs a service dog they should be able to have one.

Testifying in defense of her ex-husband at his trial, Leanna Taylor recounted how on that summer day she learned from her son's daycare teachers that her husband had not brought the child in for the day.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Linda Swanson Coughlan | 82 | 10154964395108812_10154964440833812 | I'm sorry, if he killed my baby I wouldn't be testifying for the defense.
2 | Ronny Hicks | 35 | 10154964395108812_10154964474023812 | Common sense says that since he was sending messages to other women that he wanted out of his current relationship and anything associated with it. I can't believe this psycho is testifying on his behalf. It's just a shame that 🙏🏻 wasn't able to save him 🙄
3 | RJ LaGrange | 55 | 10154964395108812_10154964420048812 | I don't think anyone's opinion matters right now. May that baby Rest In Peace. God Bless
4 | Nickee Anderson | 9 | 10154964395108812_10154964667548812 | Wow. If you have not experienced the shock, disbelief and immense emptiness that comes with losing a child - you have no right judging her reaction or appearance in court or anywhere else. There's a numbness that takes over. A sense of, "I can't believe this is my life" that forces a shell to form around your heart to protect yourself from feeling anything. It's the absolute worst, most helpless hell a parent, a mother at that, can experience. Some of you are unreal in how high & mighty you act.
5 | Rachel Smith | 7 | 10154964395108812_10154964538673812 | Why didn't the daycare contact her when her son wasn't dropped off at daycare, and if they did, why didn't she contact her husband to find out why he didn't drop their son off at daycare? He was obviously texting women on his phone throughout the day so it's not like he was unreachable.
6 | Lori Chapman-stinnett | 3 | 10154964395108812_10154964632383812 | Kinda shows that they Were in this Together... A bad relationship, they Both wanted out of, and they didn't want to deal with who gets stuck with Cooper... This way, they Both get their way and maybe a little insurance money before it's over. They even reseached how long it would take for Cooper to die, how hot the car would have to be, being childless.... She is only testifying for him for her plea deal, I'm sure... They were looking at Both of them for this. Disgusting POS... Too busy sexting to worry about his toddler dying in the car!
7 | Windy Degrees | 1 | 10154964395108812_10154964634178812 | Breakdown podcast season 2 is covering this case very thoroughly. Definitely worth listening to it. It provides context and is following this trial intelligently. Highly recommend.
8 | Jalene Stewart | 9 | 10154964395108812_10154964536388812 | I cannot believe that someone could forget their kid in a half mile. Yet he had enough of a mind to do sexting and flirt around
9 | Rachel J. Rodriguez-Jimenez | 1 | 10154964395108812_10154964784483812 | Had it been my husband, this same situation. I wouldn't be forgiving. And I'd expect the same from him towards me. Other things were priorities, sorry.
10 | Rita Sharpe | 10 | 10154964395108812_10154964424618812 | Geez... I really can't imagine anyone killing a child purposefully in this manner... and I am really concerned for people with such hate in their hearts that they think someone else could purposely kill a child. How is this not an accident ?  And it's also sad that people are treated differently when charged or not with this 'crime'.  I have heard that Democrats don't have any problems killing babies so maybe that's why they are so filled with hatred and are convinced these accidents are purposeful - they have lost their ability to be human when they think throwing a baby in the trash is ok and their thinking degrades from that point.   And here's the thing folks - you don't know the facts you aren't in the courtroom and if you think the media tells the truth you're mistaken.
11 | Sway Hobbs | 4 | 10154964395108812_10154964437178812 | I thought she was involved? Is this just her taking a deal or?
12 | Christine Oldrin Wilson | 1 | 10154964395108812_10154964531523812 | Tears? Not once did she have to wipe her eyes.

14 | Darrell Seybold | 3 | 10154964395108812_10154964478553812 | Oh my, the bleeding heart liberal drivel on this thread is amazing! And we really wonder why our country is in the shape it's in??

"I don't think he's trying to swing the election to Donald J. Trump, but I think he decided to do this and didn't care if it would have an impact on the election."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Eric Dupree | 138 | 10154964328798812_10154964346293812 | Yup...as long as he sings their song....he's a 'man of integrity'. When he doesn't, he's a rogue GOP hack. She'll probably figure a way to slither out of this just like so many other times in the past. NEVER discount the power and corruption of The Clinton Cartel.
2 | Jason Bowen | 126 | 10154964328798812_10154964332403812 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...
3 | Alan Davis | 45 | 10154964328798812_10154964352113812 | The media is left leaning and they definitely try and sway the election; but that's ok huh? Comey is doing his job!!!!if she committed crimes (which has already been proven) before the election is a perfect time. The people deserve to know. Hillary supporters don't care anyway.
4 | Brandon Hightower | 26 | 10154964328798812_10154964353943812 | Remember people Hitlary is the one who broke the law! Broke many laws! If it were you or I we would be locked up! Yet people still want to vote for her!? SMFH!
5 | Forest Mullens | 17 | 10154964328798812_10154964355673812 | Last week the same people were praising him for NOT doing his job.Now he has to do it because an american with common sense wants the truth on clintons evil and now he should step down and is "slammed " ? Y'all are comedic.
6 | Ben Pike | 15 | 10154964328798812_10154964352498812 | I don't think he should have ignored the long standing protocol on releasing info during an election, and he should have waited until he had confirmation...and I would say the same thing if it was Trump instead of Clinton...I just think it takes away from elections when candidates should be talking about policy.
7 | David Marshall | 7 | 10154964328798812_10154964364238812 | FBI ,, and now CNN giving out word for word question before a presedent debate ,,, with a CNN reporter ,,, who is now the head of the Dem party ,,,,  who is still on the Dem pay role ?

10 | Shelley Adams | 3 | 10154964328798812_10154964529593812 | He was doomed if he did and doomed if he didn't.  I think he did the right thing. He didn't do this to Hillary Clinton she did this to herself. Law is law. They have been studying these classified emails that ended up on yahoo since September.  There are some major things that are going to come out before this is all over. She is no longer in charge of whether or not it comes out.
11 | Lori Chapman-stinnett | 3 | 10154964328798812_10154964449403812 | Everybody mad because James Finally decided to do His JOB!!! I think he saw how many Americans were Angry when he decided to Not press charges against Hillary... Maybe he Listened to The People... His Boss!!!!
12 | Darline Box Kandalec | 3 | 10154964328798812_10154964430768812 | Are we just supposed to turn a blind eye to crimes or investigations thereof just because it's an election year? IF everything had been handed over when FIRST requested, this wouldn't still be an ongoing issue. Getting subpoenaed documents from the Clinton clan has been about as difficult as baptizing a cat! SHE could have had this all settled LONG ago if she had been willing to cooperate. If there was nothing to hide, she wouldn't have stalled so long nor destroyed devices or used bleach bit. The wheels of justice should keep rolling. No one else who is under investigation in the US is getting some kind of extension so they can concentrate on the election to the highest office in this land. Let the FBI do their job! It's best that we know if there's proof in these backed up files on this laptop are incriminating NOW, than AFTER November 8th. With Huma & Anthony SHARING this laptop, I don't see how she could have missed all his playing around either. It would be nice if we could trust the media anymore as well! We have as much disdain for the media as we do congress right now! The bias is SICKENING!
13 | Jeremy Mohlke | 4 | 10154964328798812_10154964431968812 | Let me get this straight. The FBI tells CONGRESS that if any new evidence came to light about Hillary's emails he would reopen the investigation. New evidence has come to light and the investigation is reopened. What did he do wrong? His job?
14 | James Mcginty | 5 | 10154964328798812_10154964369503812 | Really all DNC, and and your voter's aren't listening too the truth you are all blinded from the truth.  Put another Clinton in office there will be gnashing of teeth for all the USA, for 4years...more cowbell
15 | Frank Kozak | 5 | 10154964328798812_10154964379098812 | Just like the rape and grouping victims waiting til 3-4 weeks before the election? They could have come out in the primaries, when it happens, after the primaries, before the RNC convention...... but nope 3 - 4 weeks before the election.... hmm double standards? Different strokes for different folks?
16 | Sylvia Duron Downing | 1 | 10154964328798812_10154964420738812 | Wonder how much he was paid . No integrity. This is such a shame. We have never been the laughing stock of the world when it comes to our elections but this time where the joke. What a shame that such a wonderful country like ours has a bunch of Puppets running our government or ruining our government.
17 | Bonnie Gibson | 1 | 10154964328798812_10154964442763812 | Odd how much worst the protesters are on this latest decision , than the first decision he made allowing her to escape prosecution protesters were! The Dems are making a much bigger fuss than the Republicans did when he was going to let her by without convicting her of her crimes!
18 | Dale Goodman | 2 | 10154964328798812_10154964407763812 | Hahaha. More lies....Liberals at work:              "Many Republicans claimed that the [indictment] made by Clinton's special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh against former Reagan-era Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger the [weekend] before the 1992 election cost Bush a second term."
19 | Zachary Goates | 2 | 10154964328798812_10154964383633812 | Why do people keep saying " he has a rape case" now let's finish the sentence " he has a federal civil case for rape" which means a non criminal action. Now the fbi only deals with criminal actions. So just saying ones a criminal ones not.!.!.!.!.!
20 | Whitney Kidd Kasperski | 4 | 10154964328798812_10154964369408812 | It shouldn't matter. He has a job to do period. It doesn't matter what time of year, if it's election time etc.. if he would have waited then people would cry that he waited bc he was pro Hillary. Just move on.. he is doing his job
21 | Dave Neal | 5 | 10154964328798812_10154964403353812 | Remember when Trump was laughed at for saying Hillary had the questions ahead of time? Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.
22 | Dennis Jones | 3 | 10154964328798812_10154964385243812 | When he let Hillary Clinton go...even after lying under oath to Congress...he was the socialist democrats champion. Now he's a rogue...LOL!!!
23 | Jennifer Schilling | 4 | 10154964328798812_10154964354248812 | Killary should be in prison period!!!!So let's get this straight, the wife of a sexting pedophile works as the right hand person of the wife of a rapist. Both wives have a long history of standing behind their mans actions. One wife actually defended a pedophile rapist and set a guilty man free And her campaign cries for women's rights? You got to be joking 😂
24 | Louis Jimenez | 1 | 10154964328798812_10154964516848812 | What a bunch of crap!, anyone with brains will see it how it is, the FBI director is a registered republican who intentionally violated the law to negatively impact Hillary Clinton final days of election campaign, he was under pressure by the GOP and Donald Trump to bring the subject of the emails again without any evidence and he did, however, only the stupid, brainless, disgusting deplorables, Donald Trump supporters will believe such stupidity but look at them on TV, they are zombies. God help us!!
25 | Rachel Sinks | 0 | 10154964328798812_10154964745833812 | And he shouldn't care about what might have an impact on an election. If Loretta Lynch had done her job back in July and convened a Grand Jury on this we'd be past this by now but no. Vile corruption took over and now here we are. Buck up And do the jobs the American taxpayers are paying you to do.

Remember people, they were here first and the white man took their lands from them and forced them to live on reservations. Shame on you!
2 | Linda Torres | 272 | 10154964281373812_10154964297363812 | When the military and law enforcement serves the corporations and NOT the people. This is NOT the land of the free, there is no honor in what this nation stands for. No liberty and justice for all in here.
3 | Derrick Davis | 310 | 10154964281373812_10154964287578812 | remember when you were young and you heard about all of the terrible things the american government did to the native americans and you thought to yourself "how could they have let that happen?"It is happening again
4 | Samantha Estes | 173 | 10154964281373812_10154964314418812 | Why aren't we seeing and hearing more of this on the news? People's rights are being taken away in America. This should be the number 1 topic.

8 | Bob Bellstedt | 62 | 10154964281373812_10154964313283812 | It's hard to take pride in the American flag as it once again steals from the true owners of this land and blocks coverage of the event because the oil company owns our congress and our media🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
9 | Debbie Latimer | 12 | 10154964281373812_10154964341228812 | I don't think the type of holding cells are the problem. They have chosen to arrest people so they have to put them somewhere. Sadly, they are doing their job. HOWEVER, this should not happening at all. This is so fundamentally wrong.
10 | Jenna Thomas | 17 | 10154964281373812_10154964385213812 | 1500.00 cash only bail. Denied medical care. They wouldn't release info to family to the where abouts of their loved ones. They claimed to have 'lost' personal effects of some of those arrested. This doesn't include the outrageous fee they told the tow company to charge each owner.
11 | Rhonda Carr | 13 | 10154964281373812_10154964398763812 | I can't go up to ND to protest but I stand with the  Natives on this and the government and this oil company needs to stop and reroute if they want this project to continue (out of tribal lands)
12 | Matt McEwen | 7 | 10154964281373812_10154964509783812 | This pipeline would mean over a million jobs created from start to finish, cheaper fuel at the pumps, and safe transport getting fuel trucks off these routes and onto other needed areas in order for America to expand and better our country as a whole.  Risk of a spill are VERY unlikely and in any even valves are in place to minimize and cleanup would be minimal but you are talking the stupid "what if" because you have no idea what you are talking about and these people protesting don't either, there needs to be better education on the good this pipeline would bring.
13 | Monica White | 12 | 10154964281373812_10154964378318812 | How do they defend marking them with numbers, while holding them in kennels? #ABC? Where's that? How about strip searching them and throwing women in cells naked, explain that defense?
14 | Kyle Caudill | 11 | 10154964281373812_10154964482353812 | I've been following this very closely it is true that the police and sheriffs are very militarized and are acting more like mercenaries. They are protecting energy brothers and the pipeline instead of protecting the citizens.
15 | Heather Rollins Bovee | 5 | 10154964281373812_10154964401923812 | They are noble. I support the cause. But...they are trespassing, blocking a highway, starting fires, ect. Lawfully and peacefully protest and you won't get arrested en masse. If you break the law, I have no sympathy for you.
16 | Bill Parkinson | 3 | 10154964281373812_10154964386003812 | If I followed the money,I would think Warren Buffett is up to his old tricks again. He makes billions off his  BNSF oil trains. He doesn't want any pipelines to wreck that setup. And he's a big Democratic supporter.
17 | Judy Canup | 0 | 10154964281373812_10154964490208812 | I don't understand what's going on here in North Dakota butt it really you are embarking on the Indians land and it is their land stay off of it... if George Soros is behind it if one best beware
18 | Regina Fritts Preston | 8 | 10154964281373812_10154964516418812 | History repeats itself when wicked rule; these people have been insulted and mistreated long enough! And stop spoiling our land with all these stupid pipelines! They are accidents waiting to happen...I.e, Helena, Alabama just today...
19 | Julia Stowe | 9 | 10154964281373812_10154964311523812 | of course they do. they will always defend being evil and unlawful. what they are doing is illegal and every officer there needs to be arrested and charged. http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol2/treaties/sio0594.htm
20 | Lori Chapman-stinnett | 11 | 10154964281373812_10154964439378812 | Why isn't the Theft of their land being reported a couple times a day, instead of this stupid election, with the 2 worse senior candidates in history?!! We are Fed Up with the election and the 24/7 smear ads taking over our lives... We Are Interested in the theft of tribal land!!! They are not only trying to protect their sacred land, they are trying to save Our Water Supply!! This should concern All Of Us!! We stand with you... Stand your ground!!!
21 | Wesley Pérez | 0 | 10154964281373812_10154964812283812 | What i think is funny is how people defend "native American" by saying how the white man just "stoled" their land away. Here is a little history lesson. Humans have been living on this peace of land we call north America for 10,000 years. Do not tell me that no one "stole" land from other groups through those 10,000 years does that make those people bad? People need to get over that. Groups of people have been doing that since the dawn of man. No different than other groups of living creatures have done since the dawn of life. That is how groups have survived. One group ends of being more powerful than the other. One day a group will take down this country for themselves. So get off your high horses. What's done is done and you can't make amends. You can't exactly change history.Now for this situation yes I do believe that this pipe laying needs to change its course because we all deserve to have fresh water, land, and a place we can be and live in. These people deserve to have all that.
22 | Jamie Woolsey | 5 | 10154964281373812_10154964367448812 | I take my comment back they're not just cowards they are absolute whiny pussies. A kennel like enclosure is like 6 feet by 3 feet. They had much more room much more room much more room. You know that person that cries because they have to spend one night in jail well that's them.
23 | Matt Cordel | 6 | 10154964281373812_10154964294258812 | "Federal intervention"Who do they think calls the shots? That's why I feel bad for cops. They are sent to enforce laws politicians make and when the world watches they condemn them....... but notice how they never stop them.
24 | Janie LW | 4 | 10154964281373812_10154964414673812 | Yeah and Obama is supposed to be the Leader in Climate Change and his administration issued to permits for this pipeline.  Unbelievable. It's all about the 12 million in annual tax revenue that is pipeline will produce for the government.
25 | Shandi Andrea | 1 | 10154964281373812_10154964728208812 | Did you know the federal government can just up and take anyone's land if they declare it "in the interest of the people?"  Not only that, they don't even have to pay you for it.  INSANITY.  This is a prime example of our government being TOO BIG.

"Candy for everybody!" Pres. Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama celebrated Halloween at The White House by welcoming scores of superheroes and princesses, a Prince, a "lame duck," and one kid who dressed up as the president himself, gray hair and all. "Man, I'm not that gray," Obama said. http://abcn.ws/2fyHuz5

1 | Kathi Ann | 163 | 10154964248523812_10154964259413812 | Halloween has always been about the kids. Great job Sir!
2 | Tyler Knezevich | 225 | 10154964248523812_10154964251213812 | Trump would have called them all freeloaders and demanded they pay him a small loan of a million dollars per piece
3 | Jacquie Adelmann | 151 | 10154964248523812_10154964267813812 | A Great President!I shall dearly miss the presences of you and your family at the White House. You are a Patriot and great servant of the American people and US Constitution.  Thank you Mr. President! 😇
4 | Josie Collier | 76 | 10154964248523812_10154964313453812 | For multiple reasons not just this obviously but the Obamas are really just truly beautiful and kind-spirited people. Going to be a very sad day coming up when America loses them as President and First Lady.
5 | Anna-Marie 'Sam' Blyth | 50 | 10154964248523812_10154964303108812 | They look so relaxed and their smiles are as big as the kids!  This is truly one First Family that is so going to be missed during the next four years or more!  Have to give two thumbs up to the 'lame duck' costume...that's really too funny (or gutsy)!!!
6 | Sheila Ham | 43 | 10154964248523812_10154964296548812 | That's funny!!! He has the best sense of humor. I'm gonna miss him!! *And, don't bother with the h8 if ya feel the need!!*  ;D
7 | Nabiha Khan | 39 | 10154964248523812_10154964252993812 | I wanna be a kid all over again! Just so I can attend white House Halloween 👻
8 | Patti Brosey | 15 | 10154964248523812_10154964355913812 | I love that you have a sense of humor and manage to squeeze in a little fun once in a while, Mr. President.  We are going  miss you and your lovely family at the White House.  God Bless!
9 | Sarah Noyola | 30 | 10154964248523812_10154964262743812 | Lol love the little kids grey hair!!  Adore!!!  Fun fun.. Go Obama!
10 | Michelle Mitchell | 13 | 10154964248523812_10154964306053812 | I thought she said candy is bad for children, where's the pencils, rings, Apple's, etc. That was supposed to be better??? Ctfu photo opportunity!!!
11 | Dana Locke | 9 | 10154964248523812_10154964327288812 | They do think they are superior and believe they are above the law...just like Hillary... every chance they get they slam our country for their own agenda... remember Michelle never being proud of our country or did you not hear that being said by her...
12 | Aaron Hoilman | 15 | 10154964248523812_10154964369423812 | No matter how bad you hate them,doing something nice for a child and bringing a smile to their face is great. I can say good job Mr.president.
13 | Renae Brandt | 5 | 10154964248523812_10154964494558812 | A Lot of you are really sad on here! This picture is simply showing children at Halloween having a good time. All I mostly hear on here is a bunch of so called mature adults bringing politics in this, calling each other horrible names! Please people, this is not who we are. Right?
14 | Maria Saldana | 11 | 10154964248523812_10154964275328812 | Not to dampen the party, but is it a ' racially'  discriminating  party ?  &  Obama isn't paying for the candy... we are; and the rent.. bills... we pay everything.
15 | Jeanne Clevenger | 8 | 10154964248523812_10154964280363812 | Hillary and her Baggage would have charged them rent for entering the grounds of the White House, much like they rented out the Lincoln Bedroom.  Then if they said things that she didn't like, she would have called her hired thugs.
16 | Dawn A Phlegar | 3 | 10154964248523812_10154964473858812 | Oh so Obama is having fun while our Natives are being treated in humanely and the pipeline construction continues...... #NoDAPL!!!
17 | Eleanor Saenz | 6 | 10154964248523812_10154964384893812 | That was nice. I don't think Trump would do that cuz all the kids will afraid of him, or he might want 2 blow them up, critize about their weight.
18 | Irene Shaw | 43 | 10154964248523812_10154964267363812 | I am honestly going to miss the Obamas so much. They are such genuine people, and they are some of the most kind. They don't see themselves as superior to the average citizen, they are just like us. A loving family that values each other, rather than status. Even if it's something as simple as giving out candy on Halloween, they still go out of their way to be there for us. Love them❤ I'm sure Trump supporters will have something negative to say about this. What else can you expect from miserable creatures!
19 | Tan Hoang | 0 | 10154964248523812_10154964735528812 | Say what you will about the Obamas but one fact is undeniable: they genuinely love children and enjoy spending time around children!!! Let's see either Hillary or Trump try to match; Hillary seems uncomfortable around kids, whereas Trump just outright despises them.
20 | Gloria Ginocchio | 1 | 10154964248523812_10154964654868812 | I will miss you President Obama and your family and you will always shine Above the Rest and it's so sad that most people do not realize you are the Best.
21 | Diane Rosploch | 8 | 10154964248523812_10154964292178812 | Happy Halloween, the White House is going to miss all this fun
22 | Jennifer Kelley | 6 | 10154964248523812_10154964310858812 | I'm surprised that Michelle wasn't giving out apples and fiber bars!
23 | Alana Cammon | 0 | 10154964248523812_10154964803438812 | How fun. Wow Obama u R going to be missed!  Michelle  ... Classy First Lady ever!!!! I hope one day I can meet The Family!! Beautiful
24 | Carl Greerio | 2 | 10154964248523812_10154964447188812 | These so called news Networks MSNBC, NBC, CNBC ABC,CNN, CBS, are BOTTOM OF THE BARREL..and for their commentators, so called journalists..Obviously they moved the barrel and under it for them....ALL BOTTOM OF THE BARREL!!!!
25 | Morgan Orlins | 18 | 10154964248523812_10154964252408812 | Vote for JOBS! Vote for American renewal! Vote to DRAIN the DC establishment swamp of corruption!!Vote for Donald Trump!!

The now-closed St. Ignatius Hospital in Colfax, Washington, is said to be haunted and is now a magnet for amateur ghost hunters.

2 | Martin Ramirez IV | 1 | 10154964230688812_10154964250433812 | For starters I don't really believe in ghosts, but if I did I don't think they'd be stupid enough to show themselves around 12 people with GoPro's on or an entire production crew. Just saying, stay the night in that place for a week with nothing but candles and then document your experiences after. That's more believable to me than some guy yelling "Something touched me!" every 13 seconds like on Ghost Hunters or any other crappy ghost hunting show.

While the renewed email probe does fit with the general idea of something surprising happening in October, just before the election, one key element remains unclear at this point: intent.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Viola Spira | 421 | 10154964150363812_10154964166233812 | Remember when Trump was laughed at for saying Hillary had the questions ahead of time? Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.
2 | Marlon Estrella | 217 | 10154964150363812_10154964164178812 | Fu*k the intent of why this investigation is being pushed, Why the hell does this even exist?!? She is irresponsible and she fkn LIED about it
3 | Gordon Taylor | 141 | 10154964150363812_10154964170683812 | We, the American people, are the jury in the case of Clinton vs the American people. We have 40 years of evidence against her. I have voted guilty, and I have already voted against her.
4 | Chen Xuanzhuo | 92 | 10154964150363812_10154964162093812 | Right, so the leaked tape of Trump is about his character and leaked emails about Hillary is about intent. Can anyone be more biased than this?
5 | Kathi Sours Krell | 51 | 10154964150363812_10154964162403812 | I will vote for the most pro-life candidate, because God hates the shedding of innocent blood (Proverbs 6:17).I will vote for the most pro-Israel candidate, because God blesses those who blesses Israel & curses those who don't (Genesis 12:3).I will vote for the most pro-debt reductioncandidate, because the borrower is servant to the lender (Proverbs 22:7).I will vote for the most pro-workcandidate because God says if a man not work , let him not eat. (2 Thessalonians 3:10)I will vote for the most pro-marriage candidate, because God is for marriage as defined in Genesis 2:24 .I will vote for the candidate who most closely believes government's purpose is to reward the good & punish the evil (Romans 13).I will vote based as closely as I can on God's Word (2 Timothy 3:16), knowing that whoever gets elected, God is the one who puts all men in authority (Daniel 2:21).
6 | Noel Stack | 26 | 10154964150363812_10154964206073812 | So within two weeks of an election the FBI reopens the longest investigation in US history, say they don't know if anything is there and won't until after the election, and focuses on one aide who had a connection to a disgraced democratic congressman.And Hillary is the one who is corrupt and rigging the election?  In the words of Beyoncé: "Boy, bye."Thanks for this original post CM
7 | Max Murphree | 23 | 10154964150363812_10154964250013812 | I get tired of seeing articles written by these hack networks doing everything in their power to downplay or outright ignore anything involving a scandal with Hillary.
8 | Rowddy Fontenot | 20 | 10154964150363812_10154964280228812 | If Hillary allowed Huma Abedine without proper clearance to see / expose classified info who in turn allowed the pervert Anthony Weiner to then have access on his pedophile laced personal computer then that is a colossal mistake on Hillary's part and she is liable for punishment and criminal indictment
9 | Marla Williams | 15 | 10154964150363812_10154964321143812 | I don't give a hoot about these email's!!! If they didn't find anything after going through all the emails they had... Putting her on trail for EVER!! They need to come up with something better then the email thing! Trump still needs to show his taxes, and get through all The current LAW SUITS!! Against him...#ImStillWithHer!#GoHillary!! #Vote🔵🇺🇸
10 | Bill Veitch | 13 | 10154964150363812_10154964186718812 | We at ABC are now showing our responsible side as "journalists". There's nothing to see behind that curtain, really. We do mean really. After all Hillarhoid's campaign advisor, John Podesta the UFO chaser, told us so.
11 | Bill Mac | 13 | 10154964150363812_10154964231113812 | James Comey may be the only honest player in this Flustercluck, trying to tell us what's going on because the rest are crooked. The DOJ does nothing, the state Dept does nothing who else can Comey go to ?
12 | Jose De Leon | 4 | 10154964150363812_10154964497053812 | Mean while:Trump & Pence are on a plane... Trump looked at Pence, chuckled and said, "You know, I could throw a $1,000 bill out of the window right now and make somebody very happy." Pence shrugged his shoulders and replied, "I could throw ten $100 bills out of the window and make ten people very happy". Hearing their exchange, the pilot of the plane said to his co-pilot, "Such big-shots back there. I could throw both of them out of the window and make 256 million people very happy!!"
13 | Joseph Rathjen | 2 | 10154964150363812_10154964481533812 | ABC and the rest of the mainstream (liberal) news will do and say anything to protect their slimy, queen. The voters don't care about Hillary's intent. All they know is she's a lying dog who can't be trusted with government documents - nor can the clowns who work for her. You people have used up all your excuses for her. Now watch the White House door slam shut in her face on Election Day.
14 | Suzanne Latimer Tyson | 3 | 10154964150363812_10154964508568812 | Other government employees have sent to prison for doing less than she did, and they had no "intent" but I guess when your name is Clinton it makes a difference.
15 | Donna Fermo | 5 | 10154964150363812_10154964208573812 | What really blows my mind is how these two woman who work side by side for years (supposedly intelligent) ended up with such scumbags husbands ... at least one was half smart and kicked that sexting porno nut to the curb, just makes ya wonder! Exactly what kind of woman put up with shameless humiliation like that?
16 | Ryan Anthony Anderson | 3 | 10154964150363812_10154964360088812 | Wow, you are trying to change reality. I have never seen such BS. Report on a real story. Ya know, one that had a basis. Your reporting about opinion.

Questions is will the FBI and the government uphold a different set of laws for us and a different set of laws for them? Wikileaks has yet to drop its NOVEMBER surprise, so more to come.
18 | Samantha Rosenbeck | 1 | 10154964150363812_10154964368453812 | Noel Stack This makes sense , some how the e-mails of amb. Stevens got out . Killery track his whereabouts for a few days prior to the attack . Killery e-mailed where he would be , who he was with , how long he would be there and the reason he was there . The other issue is that the e-mail find is just a slide of hand trick . Killery and huma gave us the e-mails make no mistake , killery through the Clinton foundation just purchased 137.7 million dollars wroth of illegal arms from a war monger in the Middle East . They are to be delivered to the U.S. In mid November , orders from George soros . Putin call the CIA yesterday demanding to know why this purchase was made . Killery intends to arm the illegals here in the U.S. To creat riots and war . Obonner will call marshal law , take all weapons put killery in the White House and soros will have toppled the U.S. And become the new world order . Canada is in process now of signing a world trade agreement . It really doesn't matter who wins the election . GO TRUMP
19 | Taylor Brad | 4 | 10154964150363812_10154964270258812 | She clearly intended to put classified info on an unsecured server and lie about it! She obviously intended to hire a company to destroy evidence using bleach bit AFTER receiving an order to turn it over🤔 if that is not intent I don't know what is
20 | Jeremy Mohlke | 2 | 10154964150363812_10154964437448812 | Lol. She didn't intend to have classified emails on her server. She didn't know what classification markings were. So, let's give her the keys to America. Atleast we can trust her yo be competent enough with that right?
21 | Jason Salber | 1 | 10154964150363812_10154964415723812 | It's quite simple. Intent=putting a corrupt treasonous politician in jail where she belongs. She has had her influence stretching into the FBI.Liberals can make all the excuses they want. They claim to be against corruption, yet they are defending the most corrupt politician in the history of this country! Hypocrites.
22 | Debra Oliva | 0 | 10154964150363812_10154964817263812 | Well, there was an October surprise from the FBI for Nixon in 1972 and he still won the election. Of course, we all know what happened afterwards.http://watergate.info/chronology/brief-timeline-of-events
23 | Jennifer Van Gorder | 0 | 10154964150363812_10154964371993812 | Intent isn't part of the law!!

Additionally most people don't alert you in advance that they intend to break the law and intent has been proven bc she LIED OVER AND OVER AND OVER
24 | Lillie JJ | 1 | 10154964150363812_10154964416448812 | So she had an illegal private server in her basement and deleted 33,000 emails, and doesn't understand what classified means as the Secretary of State, but no she wasn't hiding anything. Really?
25 | Sameel Salim | 0 | 10154964150363812_10154964453458812 | To hell with this biased media...This women is corrupt to the bone. At least The Donals wears his corruption on his sleave. Im a social progressive, economic conservative. A good shakeup will do both parties good. Return both parties to actually stand for the people they are supposed to represent. You think the financial sector has poured in a billion dollars into this election cycle beciase of good will?  Take the money out of elections. Make one public channel and have them go at it 24/7 on the same publicly provided money.

John Kasich has been a vocal critic of Donald J. Trump, blasting the real estate mogul's claims of a "rigged" election as "silly."

1 | Sternlicht BJen | 223 | 10154964057113812_10154964063668812 | At least he's not fake endorsing Trump like every other republican is doing :)Good for him :)
2 | Jaye Mark | 178 | 10154964057113812_10154964090003812 | I don't agree with John Kasich on a quite a few things, but he balanced the budget in Ohio, got the unemployment rate down and is a decent hard working man. Shame that the Republican constituency didn't see value in a guy that actually knows the job, has done parts of it at the state level, isn't greedy, loves his first  wife, is an eloquent speaker and not a skirt chaser nor spending his time tying up courts with his problems. He's normal.
3 | Tonya Ballard | 62 | 10154964057113812_10154964099978812 | Kasich was the only one they presented as a reasonable choice, and this is coming from a life-long Democrat! Instead, they put forth someone hell-bent on destroying his own party, and that is truly sad.
4 | Preston Austin | 62 | 10154964057113812_10154964116998812 | Remember when all Republican candidates stood on stage at the debate and raised their hands that they would support the winner of the Republican nomination....? Funny how that works. Sore loser.
5 | Rockwell Torrey | 87 | 10154964057113812_10154964058968812 | This is your moment. This is your time to take a stand. When your grandchildren speak of you they will recount that you stood for America. You did not surrender. You did not run away. You held strong for freedom and the Constitution. You defeated Hillary Clinton. You voted Trump. You ensured that America survived.
6 | Danny Babcock | 53 | 10154964057113812_10154964069218812 | Trump… LOL!   - P.T. Barnum use to draw HUGE crowds to his freak shows just so they could say they actually got to see the freak in person.....that doesn't mean they wanted that freak on stage to be their next President.
7 | Will Wallace | 65 | 10154964057113812_10154964064118812 | Writing in a name that is not on the ballot is ridiculous to me.
8 | Paula Des | 18 | 10154964057113812_10154964212898812 | Do you really think all the droves of people turning out to vote are voting for killary...?? Think again folks! People are even seeking to change their vote with the FBI reopening the case against her once again...which isn't surprising. Try as you may bias liberal media you cannot change truth!! TRUMP 2016!🎊🎉🎈👍😀
9 | Kay Johnson | 8 | 10154964057113812_10154964195373812 | Kasich and my politics don't line up at all, but this is who should have been the Republican nominee. He consistently out polled Hillary or Bernie. And he doesn't come across as batshit crazy.
10 | Devon Michael Cantrell | 18 | 10154964057113812_10154964129788812 | The rest of the republicans should follow! John Kasich has strong family values which that's what all republicans say they have but are voting for trump.. party before country huh... which is why #ImWithHer 🇺🇸
11 | Kevin M. Carney | 11 | 10154964057113812_10154964135788812 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!
12 | Terry Hunter | 7 | 10154964057113812_10154964246428812 | Didn't John Kasich sign the pledge to vote for the republican nominee while running against Donald J. Trump? What a fink! He's crybaby sore loser! Let's call him "Cryin' Kasich"! LMAO!
13 | Renee DeJarnett | 4 | 10154964057113812_10154964247898812 | Really?! He's not the only one who rejects Trump - Kasich knows Trump is woefully unfit. He's courage that surpasses Marco and Cruz. What's more bizarre is John McCain said he's voting for Trump. That's the batsh*it crazy party.
14 | Kai Jones | 1 | 10154964057113812_10154964407543812 | And you like Trump because politicians don't like him and he isn't a politician yet wants to be one and you think the political system after giviing Obama trouble for eight years is just going to roll-over and cower in fear and do what Donald Trump says?You are stupid people.

16 | Jacob Mannix | 4 | 10154964057113812_10154964346548812 | Being from Ohio and voting for Kasich at one time, I am ashamed by his actions. He made a pledge to support whoever the republican nominee was. He's part of the problem.
17 | Frank Smaltino | 2 | 10154964057113812_10154964203888812 | Then Hillary is also silly because she just said that Trump tried to rig the election, dead voter suppression, by telling patriots to watch the polls.I guess that means Kasich is an idiot because obviously Hitlary can't be wrong?#SHEEPLE
18 | Gregg Gruwell | 3 | 10154964057113812_10154964250218812 | Kasich would probably be up by 20% over Clinton if he had been nominated. Instead, they chose a snake oil salesman, tax cheat, sexual predator and con artist whose ideas threaten the future of our nation.

23 | Bob Davy | 3 | 10154964057113812_10154964069003812 | All these prominent and "important" people keep telling us that elections can't be rigged or that voter fraud is not large enough to effect the election outcome.   WE need to ignore them and pay attention to our own thoughts and ideas.  I for one, think that fraud in all aspects of our political process, including elections, is a big deal and I want my representative to work to stamp it out.  What the minority or majority leader of congress thinks or says matters not one whit to me.
24 | Connie Yznaga Davis | 4 | 10154964057113812_10154964138963812 | This is ANOTHER  non story.. John Kasich announced long ago that he wasn't voting for Trump.

25 | Gale Martin Wilhite | 3 | 10154964057113812_10154964115358812 | At least he held his integrity unlike a ton of people. People swore to NEVER vote Trump and oh how fast they forget WHY the swore! Not me I would vote for him for dog cathcher!

Consider, for example, Trump’s illegal contribution to Florida’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, after she received multiple complaints from Florida students that they were cheated by Trump University. Once she received a $25,000 donation from Trump, her office dropped the inquiry.Or Trump’s solicitation of campaign funds from foreign officials, in clear violation of federal campaign laws.Or Trump’s refusals to pay contractors who have done work for him, many of them small businesses.Or Trump University’s repeated scams.Or the Trump Network, a pyramid scheme in violation of federal securities regulations.Or Trump Model Management, which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U.S. illegally.Or Trump’s employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts, claiming he couldn’t find Americans to do the work.Or Trump’s history of being charged with housing discrimination.Or Trump’s illegal dealings with Cuba while it was under embargo.Or Trump Foundation operating illegally.The list goes on. Donald Trump has a proven record of corruption. Hillary Clinton does not. Anyone who equates the two hasn't been paying attention.It would be nice to have an FBI investigation into these facts on Trump.(Jere). I agree! with Jere and I don't understand why Trump's errors and corruption are constantly ignored and this man laughs all including the FBI that instead of doing their job, create intrigue to favor Republicans.

24 | Nathan Shartzer | 1 | 10154964015693812_10154964069638812 | **PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN WHO SUPPORTS ISRAEL**We are coming down to the last lap, with just over a week before the election. Without question, this is the most bizarre election in my lifetime! NOTHING is normal this time around. And yet, as tired as most of us are with hearing about politics, we must remember that Free Election is a great privilege and it is one of the wonderful RIGHTS we have as American citizens and is such an honor to participate in. But even more remarkable is the fact that with the number of professing CHRISTIANS ALONE, we have the power to handpick the next President. And yet; millions of Christians do not take to heart their God-given responsibility to represent the Lord and His Word by participating in our citizen rights that we are blessed to have! I’m asking YOU – as a fellow brother or sister in Christ – to examine with an open mind and an open Bible the direction that your vote will send our nation! I believe that Christians alone could change the course of our nation!It is no longer debatable, and whether we like it or not, we as Americans will make the decision whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be the next President. Sadly, many discouraged and distraught Christians are choosing to “sit out” the election because they didn’t get the “perfect” candidate that they wanted. This is a very serious mistake; because EACH vote counts! And by NOT voting as a Christian, someone liberal/non-Christian vote wins a step up.AS BELIEVERS, WITH THE ONLY REAL, LOGICAL CHOICE BEING EITHER CLINTON OR TRUMP, CAN WE STILL HAVE SOME MANDATES THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED FOR WHO WE WILL VOTE FOR? YES! And I would like to share these 10 vital issues that must be considered. And I’m asking you as a fellow Christian to cast your vote for the only possible choice when it comes to these 10 important, future changing focuses of the two candidates. (CLICK ON THE IMAGE TO SEE A BIGGER VIEW OF IT)LET’S LOOK AT THE FIRST ONE LISTED HERE: WE MUST VOTE PRO-ISRAELThe long standing position of America has been to defend Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East; our faithful allied nation of Israel. God has so much to say in His Word about Israel and its capital Jerusalem. God has abundantly blessed America for its stance for Israel. But in recent years, things began changing, and now we are seeing more and more pressure to force Jerusalem to be given over to the Palestinians. It is no coincidence that this was predicted in the Bible to be the very issue of the last days (Zechariah 12:2-3) and will be Satan’s last attempt to make God out as a liar regarding His promises about Jerusalem. Here is the official campaign released from Donald Trump on the subject of Jerusalem:“MR. TRUMP ACKNOWLEDGED THAT JERUSALEM HAS BEEN THE ETERNAL CAPITAL OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE FOR OVER 3,000 YEARS, AND THAT THE UNITED STATES, UNDER A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, WILL FINALLY ACCEPT THE LONG-STANDING CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE TO RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS THE UNDIVIDED CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL.”This has to be one of the clearest statements of intent from any candidate in behalf of the welfare of Israel in modern times. Just last month, Donald Trump met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, assuring him that he would not be like President Obama, who gave $100 billion in aid to Iran – Israel’s arch enemy – but will stand with Israel and defend Jerusalem as their capital. AMAZING!On the other hand, Hillary has made it abundantly clear that she will continue to “two-state solution” approach and is a firm believer that Jerusalem must be divided. She has repeatedly stood against Netanyahu and against Israel. This is shameful!THE CHOICE IS OBVIOUS FOR ANYONE WHO BELIEVES IN THE AUTHORITY OF THE SCRIPTURES – WE MUST STAND WITH ISRAEL!Your vote counts! Whether you “support” Trump or not, surely you can see that as believers we have a mandate to SUPPORT ISRAEL. Do your part to vote for the only Bible stance that believers can have on this subject! To not vote is just as bad as to vote for Hillary! We MUST cast a vote in favor of Israel.Here are 10 Reasons Why Every Christian Should Stand With Israel1. THE BIBLE IS FILLED WITH ISRAEL AND IS THE FOCUS OF BIBLICAL PROPHECY2. CHRISTIANS HAVE A COMMON DESTINY BY BEING GRAFTED IN WITH ISRAELIsaiah 2:2-5; Micah 4: 1-43.BECAUSE ISRAEL IS A UNIQUE AND SPECIAL NATION TO GODExodus 19:5; Deuteronomy 14:2; Psalm 135:4 4. BECAUSE GOD SAYS HE WILL BLESS THOSE WHO BLESS THEM.Genesis 12:3; Isaiah 60:125. BECAUSE THE WORD OF GOD AND THE SON OF GOD WAS REVEALED AND GIVEN THROUGH THEM6. BECAUSE WE OWE THEM A DEBT FOR WHAT WE HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH THEMRomans 9:4-5; Romans 15:277. BECAUSE GOD'S GIFTS AND CALL ON THEM HAVE NEVER BEEN REVOKED AND CHANGEDRomans 11:26-288. BECAUSE GOD HAS PROMISED TO BRING THEM BACK TO THEIR LAND, AND TO THEIR CAPITAL CITY OF JERUSALEMAmos 9:14-15; Ezekiel 37:21-229. BECAUSE THE TIMES OF THE GENTILES ARE NEARLY FULFILLEDLuke 21:24-2810. BECAUSE GOD IS WORKING WITH THEM TO WORK OUT HIS ETERNAL KINGDOM PLANSRomans 11:15; Revelation 7:9; 11:15; Isaiah 2:3Think About It! - John Muncy**Please SHARE with as many of your FB friends as you can!**

At least 1 person dead, several workers injured in Colonial Pipeline explosion in rural Alabama, near where it burst last month, authorities say. "Pray for workers, rescue personnel," Gov. Robert Bentley said. http://abcn.ws/2e7EhRZ

1 | David Ames | 241 | 10154963874203812_10154963937773812 | And yet people wander why the WATER protesters are standing up to the pipe line in Dakota?! WATER IS LIFE!  Yes My prayers are with them and their families but I also had to make a point.
2 | Kathy Coker Phillips | 70 | 10154963874203812_10154963938713812 | Families have had to evacuate their homes and aren't being allowed back until they can get it under control. I live 2 hrs from where this happened. They had to air life 4 people and the others were sent to UAB hospital via ambulance. This is a sad situation my state, Alabama, is going thru. This is not the news for the political comments plz. Families are in extreme danger and lives are on the line. Please Pray for ALL of these families.
3 | William Petto | 97 | 10154963874203812_10154963902568812 | But yeah, let's destroy some sacred Native American land for another one of these things. #NoDAPL
4 | Lee Bargo | 23 | 10154963874203812_10154964078918812 | Well there go the gas prices again! Wonder why the Native Americans don't trust pipelines running through their lands?? Imagine that!
5 | Matthew Smith | 23 | 10154963874203812_10154963901408812 | It is ironic that this line has unexpectedly burst twice. Since there happens to be a pipeline fight up north, I'd be looking at possible sabotage
6 | Kimberly Woodhouse | 8 | 10154963874203812_10154963908693812 | No matter what anyone does or says or even protests, pipelines will go through because your lovely man made government will be certain of it. It is why I stay separate from all of it.
7 | Scott Watson | 6 | 10154963874203812_10154964034628812 | So, will you please start covering the bigger story? Genocide, political cover ups, police brutality, media silence. It's a terrible story and an important one. Wake up.
8 | Margaret Heldwein Hanson | 7 | 10154963874203812_10154964135158812 | Our Native brothers and sisters have every right to protect their lands and natural resources. Support The Standing Rock Sioux!
9 | Matthew Smith | 7 | 10154963874203812_10154963946908812 | Stop driving and consuming fuel as a nation. Then the oil companies will leave. That's what drives it all. Supply the demand.
10 | Steve Jones | 0 | 10154963874203812_10154964647333812 | So sorry to read now that we have lost a life along with others injured.

12 | Wayne Overton | 1 | 10154963874203812_10154964277938812 | I thought stuff like this could not happen!!I pray for those who are Injured.Hopefully no one was killed.Dakota should NEVER happen.Where is our government?How come they don't PROTECT THEIR PEOPLE!
13 | Vickie Sanders | 3 | 10154963874203812_10154963988293812 | Oh no! I pray everyone will be safe found safely. Also, I hope they find out what went wrong quickly, and if someone is causing this problem that they will be found quickly!
14 | Maria Ann Smith | 16 | 10154963874203812_10154963933343812 | And you wonder why my Native family is standing up for their lifeline?  I Stand With Standing Rock!!!
15 | Andrei Scutea | 3 | 10154963874203812_10154963902638812 | Hillary's infrastructure of 26 years as a Secretary of State. Lol 😂😂😂😂😂that her renewable resources maintenence. Oh and get ready to pay 22% more on health care insurance next year, that's more than $1000 for epipens.

17 | Jenifer Wilde | 6 | 10154963874203812_10154963932643812 | And about that pipeline in S.D. that has everyone all upset..THIS is why!!!!
18 | Cliff Jackson | 8 | 10154963874203812_10154963979018812 | Profits over lives. Sound familiar? Not too hard to understand why the Native Americans are protesting.

21 | Michael Condee | 4 | 10154963874203812_10154963926093812 | Hillary Clinton will spin this to tell her sheep how dangerous pipelines are and how we need millions of windmills everywhere

Hillary Clinton wasted no time addressing the email investigation looming over her campaign at a rally today, telling supporters that "there is no case here."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jason Bowen | 657 | 10154963815643812_10154963823448812 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...
2 | Jason Bowen | 401 | 10154963815643812_10154963823173812 | Just in: Clinton is now LEADING in polls in important battleground states, such as Qatar, Iraq, Iran, and SyriaAnd hopefully soon...San Quentin
3 | Nader Adel | 319 | 10154963815643812_10154963821398812 | Is that her public view all her private view?Is it the same thing when she said that the Benghazi attack was about a YouTube video?Is it the same when she said that she landed under sniper fire? Is it the same when she said that she hasn't sent or received any classified emails on her private sever?
4 | RJ LaGrange | 189 | 10154963815643812_10154963824878812 | It's really disgusting to watch how low the Democratic Party has gone this year. Undermining Bernie Sanders campaign, to the nominee being under FBI investigation, to the Department of Justice handing out immunities, to the head of the DNC giving heads up to Hillary Clinton before the primary debates and to say Republicans are crazy wasting taxpayer dollars. If Hillary didn't have anything to hide and didn't use the private server in the first place we wouldn't be in this mess
5 | Monica Whittier | 148 | 10154963815643812_10154963852228812 | Telling voters to "not get distracted" by an FBI probe into one of the candidates reminds me of the scene in The Wizard of Oz where he's being exposed as a fraud and says, "Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain."😳
6 | Jason Flowers | 148 | 10154963815643812_10154963825908812 | If she would have just handed them all over when she was ordered to she wouldn't be in this mess. Hillary has none to blame but herself
7 | Wayne Thorning | 132 | 10154963815643812_10154963842758812 | ABC,  you can keep plucking that fiddle and playing the "Same old tune" , but the American people are waking up to your biased BS,  and know that HRC is not only doomed,  but eventually going to Prison!  ... I can't wait to see your coverage of that!
8 | Chad Knaus | 105 | 10154963815643812_10154963831593812 | In other words...turn a blind eye to a criminal. I'm not a Trump supporter, but I'm not a naive moron either. Anyone who backs Hillary obviously backs dishonesty and criminal behavior as well. I hope you raise your kids to be better than that.
9 | Lorrie Salcido | 66 | 10154963815643812_10154963840418812 | Now she's begging for your vote!! And she's trying to hold on the little bit of stupid Democrats that still believe in her.....bahaha thank god the others got smart and leaning towards other candidates...anyone but her !!!
10 | Franky Ramirez | 72 | 10154963815643812_10154963825573812 | Her opinion is irrelevant. She got exposed during the primaries, so she really has no right to claim innocence. This isn't about if the right or wrong thing was done. This is about if Hillary Clinton is the person we want representing our country. And right now, she has one thing in common with terrorists: she is being investigated by the FBI. Donald Trump is not. That's a fact.
11 | Eric Johnson | 28 | 10154963815643812_10154963917298812 | Why would anyone vote for someone who wants to bring Syrian refugees into our country boggles my mind.. We have veterans who served this country sleeping on the streets.. Yet you wanna feed and house ppl not from here..
12 | Mark Greene | 31 | 10154963815643812_10154963869168812 | Democrats got no one to blame but Hillary! We find out today it's not only Comey investigating the emails! At least 5 field offices are investigating the Clinton foundation for corruption!!!!She's nothing but a lying criminal!!!!I was a democrat until this year! There was no way I could back Hillary and be able to live with myself! I would have backed Bernie,but crooked Hillary cheated him out of it as well!

19 | Henry Rios | 9 | 10154963815643812_10154963851853812 | There's no doubt that Trump and Republicans have felt the pressure of losing the race to the presidency. There's also no doubt that the GOP pressured Comey into making a statement without a pinch of evidence in order to cast doubt to undecided voters. Too many young voters out there that don't know how Al Gore was ripped off from winning the presidency; and here we go again! It doesn't matter that the FBI has no concrete proof of any wrongdoing? I am sickened by how the GOP will play filthy dirty politics to win at any cost. Democrats need to grow a pair and play dirty too!!! If Trump can cast accusations without proof then let's do the same. Since he is unwilling to show his taxes, then that must mean he is a crook. Since there are so many women claiming sexual assault and misconduct, then he must be a sexual predator. His racist, sexist, divisive comments, and the fact that he does not offer substantial or proven policies--that he'll offer real plans AFTER he becomes president is absolutely OUTRAGEOUS! The email scandal is the only thing the GOP and Trump have left. Let's see...emails vs. sexual assault and misconduct, criminal business deals, and the fact that he has absolutely NO EXPERIENCE to ensure that he can do the job as president. Trump supporters will say that it doesn't matter that he doesn't have the knowledge and experience, as he will hire people to run the country for him. OH HELL NO! Hillary supporters must stand their ground and vote for Hillary 2016! Please get out there and VOTE!
20 | Charles Vorndran Jr. | 5 | 10154963815643812_10154963923913812 | Clinton should be in jail..and if you vote for her your part of the problem in America..not that Trump is a great candidate either. She shouldn't even be allowed to run for president..and we all know what happened the last time the Clinton's had interns..
21 | Dudley Davis | 9 | 10154963815643812_10154963903788812 | We know "All Too Well" that you're lying again!!!  I'm so glad my life isn't so boring that i have nothing but time on my hands (Like those people behind her) to listen to you telling me lie after lie after lie after lie..................Your wickedness and treachery is finally catching up to you!!!
22 | Mark Jacobs | 3 | 10154963815643812_10154963869803812 | Oh I'm sure that the pos would like everyone to just not consider all those bad things she has done.  Waste of air and space in our country.  More I look at that pos face the sicker I get.  What a piece of work the woman is!!!!   😡😡😡
23 | Sara Roach | 7 | 10154963815643812_10154963838273812 | She wouldn't be saying this if it was trump was being investigated for the same thing. She would go out of her way to show how big of a deal it would be then.  I hate politics
24 | Jesse Fuentes | 17 | 10154963815643812_10154963827273812 | And the hits just keep on coming...http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2016/10/31/donna-brazile-out-at-cnn-amid-leaks-to-clinton-campaign/#.WBeCwSOOBWs.twitter
25 | Kenneth Isbell | 8 | 10154963815643812_10154963886098812 | Ok, we now know for certain that CNN fed debate questions to Donna Brazile. Now, are there any FCC rules against this? I know it's totally wrong and unethical, but is it actually illegal? Are there DNC rules against it? Are there rules against a candidate receiving questions before a debate? Do you think Hillary Clinton will even make a statement or explain herself regarding this unethical conduct? I know these are a lot of questions but I feel they are questions that need to be answered.

President Obama, who was the first to use the @POTUS Twitter handle, will hand over the account to the next president on Jan. 20, 2017.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mark McKellar | 29 | 10154963608733812_10154963638988812 | Busted! Top Hillary Clinton aide, and her husband, Anthony Weiner, just got caught breaking the law. They downloaded all of Hillary Clinton's emails and were going thru them to see which ones they needed to make disappear.That's why there are 33,000 missing emails. They were breaking the law for Hillary Clinton. This is getting worse than Watergate where President Nixon was impeached. The way to really crack this thing open because Human Abedin doesn't want to talk is to offer her husband, Anthony Weiner, who is current facing 50 yrs in jail on a sex charge, a plead deal to out his ex-wife Human Abedin and Hillary Clinton.  We better hope President Donald J Trump wins or by default weirdo Tim Kaine could be president, God Help Us All!
2 | Len LaVigne | 4 | 10154963608733812_10154963696608812 | All these facts on this one comment thread? Shouldn't you be sharing your information so Trump can be elected? Since there is such a wealth of knowledge of the facts here, clearly ...
3 | Toc Tuimtg | 2 | 10154963608733812_10154963739068812 | Funny that dirty unions, welfare folks, wash. lame democrats, clintons have healthcare payed for by the people in hardest hit $300-$1000 premium ranges of obamcare. Most of them would not vote democrat, for clinton or obama.Almost seems this obamcare garbage was intentionally created, hard to believe anything could be this feckless? Remember, obama does not have to live with obamacare or open borders, he is exempt as are his trolls.
4 | Dean Felix | 5 | 10154963608733812_10154963679088812 | For those of you who wonder why so many of us are voting for Trump- I think this sums it up pretty good! For What It's Worth Department:                                        The Media just doesn’t get it....they can't believe that people are so angry     that they can no longer be manipulated!  Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes, he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phony pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and it's going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.

They have to fit the monopolized anti-American media and the corruption of the liberal left. Same as it ever was. They pick the black role models, hero's, and of course their activists.

The cheating, corruption, lying, name calling, spin, the outing of msm as corrupt and biased etc etc. This has been like watching a Shakespeare play, with all the sordid characters and evil twisted plots. An Olympics of filth... just unmissable stuff.

He lied to the American people when he said he didn't know anything about it. He was emailing Hillary all along using a false name. They have an email from Cheryl Mills that shows how worried they were about that lie and said they need to clean it up.
24 | Bernard J. Martinez | 1 | 10154963608733812_10154963787798812 | If Hillary Clinton becomes president, she will make history, not only as the first woman to hold that office, but also by most likely being the second President Clinton to be impeached.A President Hillary would not only pick up where the Obama administration left off in terms of the corruption of government agencies, she and her cohorts in “Clinton Inc.” would probably be the most corrupt in American history.If you think Obama’s corruption of once respected federal agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service, FBI, and Department of Justice was bad, you haven’t seen anything yet.Clinton would pack the Supreme Court with people who will make decisions based on political impact and left wing ideology rather than the Constitution — abortions anytime, anywhere, for any reason including gender or racial selection; no right to private ownership of hand guns; banning the pledge of allegiance to the flag and public religious displays; striking the words "In God We Trust" from currency; and, limiting or killing charter schools and vouchers for low income students to name just a few.If Attorney General Loretta Lynch can refuse to answer questions on the $1.7 billon not so secret ransom payment to Iran to release our hostages, she and the politicized DOJ will be totally unaccountable with her friend Hillary as President and her airplane chit chat buddy Bill in the East Wing!We now learn that she is also reportedly upset that FBI Director Comey reopened the Hillary email investigation.Hillary and her friends will turn the United States into a 21st century banana republic.Banana republics have been characterized by some as systems having an unaccountable chief executive who ignores the rule of law when it suits his/her purposes; ignores accountability, commits self-serving acts in secret to enrich themselves and their friends and cronies; tolerates widespread corruption, and generally embraces a totalitarian attitude in which the leader can break laws whenever he/she feels it’s justified to protect the “people” — sound familiar?And what will happen in the black communities where she, with hot sauce in her purse, panders for votes in churches and soul food restaurants?Who will protect those communities when a Clinton anti-cop “pigs in a blanket” atmosphere leads to:Increased assassinations of police    Attempts to nationalize major city police forces by DOJ regulation and mandate creating a backlash where police simply do not police those communities    Increased shootings and deaths by urban gangs emboldened by Clinton’s failure to criticize the killing fields in places like Chicago and knowing that black on black killings are not a priority of the Black Lives Matter Movement — or a Clinton White House or DOJ    And what group has and will be her main allies in finishing the fundamental transformation of America which Obama has begun; protecting her from criticism; and shielding her from and burying negative stories on any corruption as it has attempted do during this campaign — the American mainstream media.    Given the unabashed and unapologetic collusion of much of the major media with the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the White House, as revealed in the WikiLeaks emails, we are no longer a country where the press even pretends to be objective and non-political — it is a rigged system not unlike those in many Third World countries!One thing is clear. The mainline television networks, CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times and The Washington Post, to name a few, are as to Hillary Clinton as the press in Russia, Cuba, North Korea and many third world countries are to governments in those countries — in their hip pockets.For example, the Media Research Center (MRC) reports that the major media devoted 91 percent of their coverage to negative stories on Trump. Combine this with the fact that Clinton has received 96 per cent of donations of journalists and there’s no doubt the fix is in.Columnist Patrick Buchanan, in a recent column in Newsmax.com, quoted Theodore White on the power of the press saying: “It sets the agenda of public discussion; and this sweeping power is unrestrained by any law. It determines what people will talk about and think about — an authority that in other nations is reserved for tyrants, priests, parties . . . ”And so, it is in this election campaign.The major media is nothing more than an adjunct communications department for the Clinton campaign!Paul Jefferson was right in a recent article in the American Thinker when he said: “. . . serving their own shortsighted self-interest, the mainstream news media have abandoned the neutrality and integrity that is crucial for their role in society. In doing so, they themselves have upended a key pillar of our democracy . . . this is a betrayal of the American public.”Trump said he will “drain the swamp” of corruption if elected. The question is, who and how will the media swamp of corruption and bias be drained, cleansed, and restored to the role intended by the nation’s founders?Clarence V. McKee is president of McKee Communications, Inc., a government, political, and media relations consulting firm in Florida. He held several positions in the Reagan administration as well as in the Reagan presidential campaigns. He is a former co-owner of WTVT-TV in Tampa and former president of the Florida Association of Broadcasters. Read more of his reports — Go Here Now.

Body cam video shows Santa Fe police officer rescuing an 87-year-old woman from a burning car. "I could have burned to dea." http://abcn.ws/2eNMdMe
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Adriana Roger | 339 | 10154963517513812_10154963531663812 | Good lord why didn't he just grab her and pull her out. The fire is right by the door where her arm was trying to get out. Come on officer!!
2 | Christy Maciejewski Richberger | 91 | 10154963517513812_10154963536983812 | None of you get it! She probably would have sat there petrified with fear. Just because he did not physically drag her from the car he still helped her by realizing she had to get out. Coaxing and coaching her along!
3 | Nexh Kaliqanaj | 74 | 10154963517513812_10154963539358812 | What kind of cop is that?! Damn, just grab her out of there 😡That's not a rescue, that's...... don't know what to call it
4 | Carolyn Crabb | 33 | 10154963517513812_10154963544948812 | He watched her get out of the car and kept telling her to come on. How is that rescuing her. I kept thinking, help her out of the car before she gets burned.
5 | Lynette Borel | 21 | 10154963517513812_10154963531313812 | I know right???? Fire is coming thru the door jam and the cop is still just waving his hand for her to get out.  ugh   Oh well atleast she got her booty out of that car.
6 | Yule Jamaa Frank | 10 | 10154963517513812_10154963581893812 | Looks like she rescued herself! I don't see her being assisted out of the car despite flames already going through the dashboard!
7 | Chrystal Chavez | 20 | 10154963517513812_10154963543473812 | It sure the hell don't look like he was helping her, poor lady was moving so slow he could of picked her up or pulled her out or something instead of just standing there to see if she was going to make it out. Jackass.
8 | Carter Schofield | 36 | 10154963517513812_10154963544548812 | sorry but 87 year olds shouldn't be driving it's a risk for everyone on the road because people that age don't have the same reactions mentally or physically as younger drivers ....just look at her couldn't barely get out of the car she probably drives 15 mph on the highway
9 | Cheryl Goodacre | 4 | 10154963517513812_10154963975993812 | Ok....after watching this a couple of times she was struggling to get out and had to grab hold of the pickup truck bed to get her balance to stand.  I never saw that male hand lifting her out or holding her steady and leading her away....Now everyone is telling me it was the invisible arm out from the view of the camera.But she still had to grab hold of the pick up bed to get her balance. She was still too close to the fire. 🔥
10 | Melissa Norman Barker | 9 | 10154963517513812_10154963568763812 | He done exactly the right thing, if the fire had gotten closer i am sure he would have physically helped her. You can not just go grab an elderly person especially not knowing her mental state besides already being scared. Does she dementia of Alzheimer's type? If so, go grab her and let me know how that works out for ya.
11 | Abby Rich | 4 | 10154963517513812_10154963675813812 | Body cam wearing officers know when to video an incident, and when not to. It just took them a little time to get their strategies down pat. Watch video, if they are targeting a Black person, the person will be out of frame, especially when they shoot them.. Aim is everything.
12 | Joan DeLuca | 4 | 10154963517513812_10154963905723812 | This guy did the most important thing....he got her to come out....it's pretty likely that she was frozen in panic and couldn't move.  And dragging her out may very well have seriously injured her, as well as increasing her fright....
13 | Danielle Weatherman | 2 | 10154963517513812_10154963796318812 | There is no easy way to pull someone of ANY age from a burning car?! He should have grabbed her and yanked her out and carried or dragged her to safety!! Not just stand there and wiggle his fingers at her to coax her! Smdh!
14 | Wade Williamson | 0 | 10154963517513812_10154964633073812 | Love all the people that know so much about rescue. He would have injured her if he yanked her out of the car. Lawsuits or death could have happened doing what so many of you are saying. They both walked away uninjured. I'd say that was a job well done. Most of you wouldn't have even put the phone down.
15 | Tara Thompson | 0 | 10154963517513812_10154964522228812 | My lord ..help the poor lady instead of just talking to her . She obviously was upset and scared, and had a hard time getting herself out of the car . Thank you for being there, however the officer could have Physically helped her out . I'm glad she's ok , poor thing.
16 | Terri Hight | 3 | 10154963517513812_10154964170743812 | Elderly people tend to have brittle bones and skin that tears easily. They also are more likely to pull away if someone just grabs them. He stayed right by her and made sure she got out safely.

18 | Wayne R Folmar | 3 | 10154963517513812_10154963561158812 | If he would have grabbed her and pulled her out they'd be protesting for police brutality you know how it is now a days...lol
19 | Joyce Golden | 0 | 10154963517513812_10154964115543812 | She is a tiny little lady. He should have picked her up and carried her a safe distance from her car. He didn't even reach his hand out to her so she could steady herself. Sorry, but as a "rescue" this sucked!
20 | Jeff York | 0 | 10154963517513812_10154964153298812 | that was not no a helping hand at all,i would of grab her and pull her in a second,shouldnt post lies,i come from a family of police officers and this is hard to believe,period
21 | Chris Jones | 0 | 10154963517513812_10154964362678812 | she shouldn't be driving in the first place. I would've let that old sloth die. the auto insurance company should not pay for that. that barely living cadaver should never be allowed to drive.
22 | Donald Slicer | 0 | 10154963517513812_10154964519248812 | Ii am not seeing this ... first of all, the driver was a man?  Secondly, this was hardly a rescue ... the officer did nothing to physically assist him out of the vehicle.  Wow.
23 | Enayat Nazari | 0 | 10154963517513812_10154964584033812 | This cop was looking for a bigger publicity not enough exciting news so he let the nature to take its course. This is shameful.

Denle una medalla al honor por tan loable acto al "oficial".Ches estupideces.El mundo se llena cada vez mas de aberraciones "vivientes" como esas.
