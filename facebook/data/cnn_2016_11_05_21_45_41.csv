For your own well-being please do not attempt to engage, inform or feed the animals as they process their grief, but feel free to scroll through and observe their antics as they rage among themselves.Management greatly appreciates your patience and self-discipline.
4 | Bobby Chance | 498 | 10155562483596509_10155562494326509 | To all the people reacting with this using the laughing emoji, I don't think this is a laughing matter. Look, I'm not fan of Trump but I don't think it's funny he needed to be rushed off the stage.
5 | Allen Williams | 628 | 10155562483596509_10155562489386509 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.PLEASE SHARE !!
6 | Denise Lynn Maki | 379 | 10155562483596509_10155562496231509 | well well, might be a staged skit, he has been running out of things to say, since he has no plan for the country, this should take up some of the next 3 days time.....LOL
7 | Connor Ewald | 164 | 10155562483596509_10155562502456509 | The fact that people think that it was funny or staged makes you absolutely no better than the Trump supporters you make fun of. As much as I don't like Hillary, I wouldn't want anything bad to happen to her. Have some class.
8 | Robert Ramirez | 509 | 10155562483596509_10155562488171509 | Lol Trump getting back what he preaches! Garranteed if this clown gets elected he will get a whole lot more of this! Trump don't even think about coming here to California..EVER.
9 | Akoni Arnie | 202 | 10155562483596509_10155562487066509 | That paid Hillary protestor scum got shut down by deplorables and secret service; hes not going home tonight, Lol
10 | Jen McNamara | 151 | 10155562483596509_10155562496681509 | Oh man. That was SO staged! He didn't looked shocked at all to be grabbed and rushed off stage. That was so faked and staged. How shameful. Another scare tactic.
11 | Steinar Aadnekvam | 86 | 10155562483596509_10155562498401509 | THIS COULD BE A GREAT PUBLICITY STUNT FOR TRUMP. We should consider the possibility that this was simply planted by the Trump campaign.
12 | Debbie Willis | 43 | 10155562483596509_944143402396188 | It is very strange that he had absolutely no reaction to the the secret service running up and grabbing him, didn't even look over in surprise, nothing.
13 | Shanan Bobon | 45 | 10155562483596509_10155562495791509 | On Wednesday, the United States will still be the greatest country on earth. President Trump will not change that. President Clinton will not change that. The only thing that will ever change that is the lot of us getting so bogged down trying to harm each other that we fail to do the things we need to do to keep this country great, the things we need to do to make this country better. Go to the polls and cast your vote. Hope that there are more people supporting your candidate than there are people supporting the other candidate but remember to respect ALL people. WE are America and WE are to what they are referring when they say "GREAT". On Wednesday, let's be GREAT. Let's embrace the election results, whether your candidate wins or loses, and let's keep moving forward finding ways to work together to innovate and advance democratic ideals throughout the world.‚ÄúAmerica was not built on fear. America was built on courage, on imagination and an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand.‚Äù Harry S Truman
14 | Daniel Cameron | 45 | 10155562483596509_10155562500806509 | It doesn't matter which candidate you support, threatening someone's life just because you don't agree with them will never be acceptable.
15 | Richard LaBoy | 46 | 10155562483596509_10155562505771509 | There was s big difference btw both parties rally today. Everything about Trump is problematic and his negative energy creates those hostile environments wherever he goes. If it continues it will only get worst.
16 | Stephanie ter Veen | 15 | 10155562483596509_1803562073190934 | Who sows wind harvests storm!!!! This is self created agression!!! It is not unexpected Mr. Trump. Happy though nobody got hurt.
17 | Rj GStatus | 55 | 10155562483596509_10155562487926509 | He was about to say something even more dumb than ever
18 | Susan Embry-Busch | 11 | 10155562483596509_1355598381119620 | I have lost all respect for CNN. Seriously? Did you see his face? He wasn't surprised by this at all. I wouldn't be surprised if this was all planned out ahead of time just for the drama of it all. He had a protestor surprise him one other time and his reaction was completely different. He reacted like the wimp he is. Your channel has been feeding right into his hand for the last couple of months. I have switched to MSNBC because you have lost my trust. I'm sure plenty of Trumpettes will say so what, but I'm not the only one. Eventually, selling out will impact your bottom dollar. Might as well rename your station TNN...what a joke.
19 | Thomas McAdoo | 11 | 10155562483596509_1355602474452544 | Totally planned. There is no way the secret service would let him come back, they would have gotten him out of and away from the building as fast as possible, until the threat could be determined credible or not credible.
20 | Greg Moore | 14 | 10155562483596509_1355597271119731 | News coverage....nothing more.  He lost the election to Hillary and handed over the Senate majority to Democrats...now he wants his supporters to think his 9 million vote loss was because he was going to do something big, great, the best.
21 | Sam Foster | 7 | 10155562483596509_1803561743190967 | It's better to be safe than sorry. Most important thing is the safety of our candidates for public office. Even though I have been critical of Mr. Trump I hope he, his family, and supporters are all OK. We are ALL Americans, and violence of any type at a political event is unacceptable. Good work, Secret Service. They have a very difficult job, and it's nice to see they are on the ball.
22 | Nathan Hazlett | 9 | 10155562483596509_944145492395979 | If things don't calm down, there is a real risk that a far left or far right nut will attack one of these candidates. I think Trump is a disaster but this is not the way to protest. There was obviously a real threat otherwise they wouldn't have acted...
23 | Tim Myram | 6 | 10155562483596509_1803565399857268 | I had so much fun watching this...I deep down feel sorry that his life MAY have been threatened but I am not sad. I believe he instilled so much fear about what he will do if he becomes President that some people are acting out so it doesn't happen. People are truly scared about what will happen to the world if he wins.
24 | Illa Rodgers | 10 | 10155562483596509_1355598287786296 | OMG..What happened??? I think the Big people are fearing he is going to be the next POTUS...I pray for Donald Trumps protection
25 | Andrea Blackwell | 5 | 10155562483596509_1803567156523759 | FAKE....if it was a REAL bomb threat they would've emptied out the arena. #foh. #trumpbullshitatitsfinest

The students hoped to show how affirmative action "demeans minorities on our campus by placing labels of race and gender on their accomplishments."

1 | John J Fletcher III | 11 | 10155562442096509_10155562486231509 | The ones always bring up race are the true racists, the liberals! Liberals feel like they have to keep minority's in a little box and protect them!

I'm sure George Washington & ALL of our Founding Fathers are rolling over in their graves. Not to even mention what grief The Almighty must feel looking down on a country which He so unbelievably loved. My heart breaks daily for my country. God Bless & Thank you, George Washington. How did we come to Trump & Hillary...?
3 | Jeff Grzeszczak | 17 | 10155562442096509_10155562447211509 | CNN where is the news on this ? Investigative journalist Edward Klein said that behind the scenes, the FBI is going "full tilt" in their investigations of Hillary Clinton's private email server and pay-for-play allegations against the Clinton Foundation. Ed Klein: 'Good Chance' By 2017, FBI Will Recommend Clinton Indictment
4 | Jan Gibson | 5 | 10155562442096509_10155562478896509 | I was just watching Bill Clinton talk about plans for bringing refugees into Detroit . Fixing up the vacant houses and putting them in those houses . No mention of the homeless already there . Is it because they are majority black? So we just leave them on the streets and bring in those that many still believe in slavery ? I don't get why this is ok with democrats .
5 | Amaury Francisco Guerrero | 7 | 10155562442096509_10155562444921509 | The Hillary you see you on TV is not the real Hillary. She is not pro gay as she claims to be to get votes. She voted against gay marriage and advocated against it for decades, plus she has a great relationship with countries where gays are hung or beheaded. She is not for abortion rights, she was infected with hate against abortion the vast majority of her failed political career. She is not pro immigration reform, she voted for a stronger wall and even called for a bigger wall than trump is years ago and was opposed to give amnesty to undocumented immigrants. She is not for peace, she supported the invasion of Nigeria, she was the architect of the overthrowing of Gaddafi and destruction of Libya which is the centre of the migrants crisis in Europe, she voted for Iraq war, she is also one of the main architects of the war imposed on Syria by foreign countries and terrorist groups, she also advocates for confrontation with Iran and provoking Russia and China which could only lead to a world catastrophe. She is not for black people either, she helped create legislation during her husband's era that put near a million black people in prison and even called them "super predators"!. She is a sociopath and a horrible person, she is also a pathological liar, a criminal and evil who claims to stand for women while for decades she threatened every woman who accused her husband of rape and she even got a known rapist out of jail and takes money from countries that treat women like garbage. The only people she will serve are the big banks, the military industrial complex, big oil, Monsanto, big pharma and the global finance system.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Annabella Sanchez | 65 | 10155562379786509_10155562387886509 | (Saw this comment and had to share) If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in millions of refugees that believe gays should be executed?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you have are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Hillary's plan will open our borders and she will WRECK our Gun rights,The supreme Court, The economy,The pro-life cause,Military-Strength,Religious freedom,Freedom of speech,And American culture.A woman who covered up over 16 rapes of woman by her husband had plenty of people murdered, shared top secret documents, has donated and accepted millions from gulf state dictators who behead gay people on a weekly basis. I don't really have enough room to list all of her scandals but I'll just mention the ones that really make me cringe, like looting and vandalizing the white house before leaving, and how about turning the IRS into the gestapo, or murdering Vince foster or maybe leaving those 4 American soldiers without support in Benghazi to die, or maybe claiming that she came under sniper fire in Bosnia when that was clearly a lie based on video evidence, or maybe covering up all of bills dirty secrets, or maybe selling high tech secrets to China.We've already had to impeach 1 Clinton we don't need them back in the Whitehouse. #KILLARYFORPRISON2016
2 | Kristyl Addison | 34 | 10155562379786509_10155562403316509 | What better way for Trump to cry foul when he loses than to say that the election was botched because of the  'I changed my mind' voter confusion. I'm sticking with my original choice. Her.
3 | William Bontrager | 24 | 10155562379786509_10155562400986509 | Hey Millennials, listen to this.

This is what they think of you.
4 | Michael Lucas | 24 | 10155562379786509_10155562392936509 | Well after having to change the channel due to my kids watching TV and Hillary's commercial bashing Trump and the language. Yes I would. Oh wait I'm not voting for Hillary. Im good..

Maybe false flag operation by trump himself, who knows what this guy is capable of. He grabs *ussies and runs like one.This happens, when guys like Trump give weapons to everyone and say it is ok. Question: Why didn't Trump shoot back? Too slow? All these NRA-lies (need guns to protect ourselves) doesn't work in reality. However, He's a coward, runs like a chicken. Duck and cover and run. What a weirdo. Did he serve in army? No?! Smells like coward. RUN ITCH RUN! Greetz from Germany.

16 | Donnie Brasco Jr. | 0 | 10155562310736509_10155562541006509 | TO ALL FILIPINOS HERE & ABROAD:As you too must have realized by now and it now obviously appears that this is an organized, well-orchestrated black propaganda against the new government intended for the foreign press and with US, UN, and the international community as the main or target audience. It is no longer much for us Filipinos based in Philippines as we can more easily verify the veracity of the information and see through the lies and half-truths being presented.Some groups are resorting to black ops after the government waged a serious war against the players in the multi-billion illegal drug trade which has become a huge threat to the lives, wealth, and power of several narco-politicians and big time drug lords. Our country's oligarchs are equally threatened by and unhappy with many of the President's pronouncements. You must have seen the latest video from New York Times--a pre-taped video of Mr. Matobato's testimony before he even testified. It even came with an English sub-title (readily available!). Other foreign news outlets were also provided with one-sided information and testimony of the in-credible witness as he vilified the President. Foreign press were either fed or were only able to pick up one side of the story--and that is, the bad side of the story which some groups want the international community to see and to believe. Needless to say, these are not only detrimental to our President but to the entire country as well. Since the President enjoys the trust & support of 91% of Filipinos and most Filipinos are no longer easily manipulated by the local mainstream media, this group are now resorting to foreign media and are deliberately feeding these international new agencies with inaccurate, one-sided, distorted information in order to:1) incite the international community to protest 2) invite UN, US, and other countries to interfereAll these with the end in view of protecting their own interests--their lives & wealth and their hope of getting themselves back to power.As such, we urge all law abiding citizens to be vigilant and to be well-informed so as not to be easily swayed by these massive disinformation campaign.More importantly, we urge all Filipinos to protect the truth and to help us combat this on-going massive campaign against the President and the new govt. LET US DO OUR SHARE AND LET US DO THIS TOGETHER NOT JUST TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO HELP PROTECT OUR COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE'S WELFARE--AND TO HELP PREVENT UNNECESSARY UPHEAVAL. How?Apart from using FB, Twitter, and Instagram to share our views, here are other things we can do:1. Many of you here can write well or in fact have already written and posted in FB walls your own stories, analysis, and opinions about the President and his fight against drugs. Please share those relevant positive experiences and opinions to the world and let the international community see the other side of the picture.Let's write and show these foreign press the other side of the story.

Organizers called the demonstrators the "Bonus Expeditionary Force", to echo the name of World War I's American Expeditionary Forces, while the media referred to them as the "Bonus Army" or "Bonus Marchers". The contingent was led by Walter W. Waters, a former U.S. Army sergeant.Many of the war veterans had been out of work since the beginning of the Great Depression. The World War Adjusted Compensation Act of 1924 had awarded them bonuses in the form of certificates they could not redeem until 1945. Each service certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment plus compound interest. The principal demand of the Bonus Army was the immediate cash payment of their certificates.

7 | Andy Sandfoss | 2 | 10155562228881509_10155562256916509 | I have had enough of CNN and its feckless, irresponsible promotion of the Trump pestilence. You have been building him up, ignoring or minimizing his lies, and blowing up everything Clinton does into a major scandal, whether proven or not. All of this becuase CNN chooses to publish "clickbait" rather than facts; and apparently frears trump retribution after the election.. Goodbye CNN; I'm moving on to Reuters or some other, more honest, less cowardly news source.

1 | Emanuel Kanto Dushaj | 99 | 10155562228921509_10155562231146509 | Can't wait until Tuesday comes. This election has caused me to feel some type of way, (not in a good way). It is a depressing election honestly in both sides, political polarization is ridiculous. At this point, I don't care who wins. I showed my views the last year, this is the first election I get to vote in, but there's no talking with some people, trying to share ideas and thoughts just gets you the saying, "You know nothing". I just want to continue pursuing my education, get married and try to help others. This election has caused negativity, from both sides, at work, school and social environments. Everyone gets mad, everyone shows anger from both sides.
2 | Ulises Vega | 159 | 10155562228921509_10155562243076509 | Well, I'm tired of Trump bullying women, disabled people, immigrants, muslims etc.. That's why I'm voting Hillary Clinton as President of the United States America! God bless everyone. #Historyinthemaking

20 | Josh Smith | 0 | 10155562228921509_1853961591506814 | (Saw this comment and had to share) If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in millions of refugees that believe gays should be executed?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you have are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Hillary's plan will open our borders and she will WRECK our Gun rights,The supreme Court, The economy,The pro-life cause,Military-Strength,Religious freedom,Freedom of speech,And American culture.A woman who covered up over 16 rapes of woman by her husband had plenty of people murdered, shared top secret documents, has donated and accepted millions from gulf state dictators who behead gay people on a weekly basis. I don't really have enough room to list all of her scandals but I'll just mention the ones that really make me cringe, like looting and vandalizing the white house before leaving, and how about turning the IRS into the gestapo, or murdering Vince foster or maybe leaving those 4 American soldiers without support in Benghazi to die, or maybe claiming that she came under sniper fire in Bosnia when that was clearly a lie based on video evidence, or maybe covering up all of bills dirty secrets, or maybe selling high tech secrets to China.We've already had to impeach 1 Clinton we don't need them back in the Whitehouse. #KILLARYFORPRISON2016

Mr. Trump should accept the federal government‚Äôs order to negotiate and treat his workers with respect.‚ÄùUnlike most Republican presidential nominees, Trump has pitched himself as a candidate for union workers.

18 | Samantha Geer | 7 | 10155562068971509_10155562109676509 | A Woman's View on TrumpSomeone asked a woman how she could vote for Trump, a ‚Äúmisogynist, a racist and a bigot‚Äù.Here is her answer:     Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.    Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.    Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.    Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.    Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.    Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.    Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?    Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.      Because I fear for my family‚Äôs safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues ‚Äì which is a threat to our way of life.    Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration.  Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.    Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.    Because it is about time someone puts America 's interests ahead of other countries.    Because I know he recognizes and embraces America 's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.    Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.    And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.
19 | Veronica Breeding Russell | 2 | 10155562068971509_1801953003415754 | How brave. Sit back and let others pull the trigger, all while convincing yourself you played no part in it. This is why I will be voting straight down the democratic party line. They are putting their party affiliation about the well being of the democracy.
20 | Julie Adams Glauser | 0 | 10155562068971509_1852327821668475 | I have a problem with this, because our democracy is at stake here... this man is smart enough to know that. I agree that if you don't know what the job entails and you're not sure who is capable, then maybe you shouldn't vote, but he does! He just doesn't love our country as much as he loves the Republican Party. Just my opinion of course.

22 | Tom M Chang | 2 | 10155562068971509_10155562202376509 | You notice Hillary's pointing out regularly how many Republicans are supporting her, particularly in her ads. How many Bernie supporters was Trump able to latch on and brag about?
23 | Dennis Mortell | 2 | 10155562068971509_10155562162716509 | Here's the part I don't understand, Hillary's bunch are saying that the FBI came out with that statement last week about reopening the FBI investigation on her, because they want Trump to win. While at the same time, they're saying Trump is in cahoots with the Russians. So, by that line of reasoning, the FBI want's to help Russia infiltrate our Highest office in the land? Really? The FBI want's that? Grow a brain. CNN, you've been working with democrats too long.
24 | Ryan Wii | 0 | 10155562068971509_1852320071669250 | Be a partiot and vote for your country. Trump is different than Dole, Bush, McCain, Romney. Those are honorable people. Trump is a fascist. When fascists get power, they don't give it up!
25 | Marianne Flanagan | 0 | 10155562068971509_1852322461669011 | How sad. There is an alternative-an intelligent, pro-environment, anti-war candidate. I voted for Jill Stein. I am not a millennial, but on Social Security. Every old Bernie Sanders site is green for Jill Stein. All I hear is pro-Clinton chatter on Erin Burnett for a pro-war candidate whose actions will provoke a war with Russia.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/05/the-future-under-either-donald-trump-or-hillary-clinton-looks-da/

Another national survey shows a near-even race between Hillary Clinton  and Donald J. Trump.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Glen Parks | 564 | 10155561967771509_10155561970156509 | Trump lost months ago. CNN is just running with this narrative in order to keep their election ratings high. Any other Republican would be up at least 12 points nationally right now.
2 | Isaac Anim | 476 | 10155561967771509_10155561969526509 | Really? Consider that Donald Trump actually has thousands of people working for him that are not on the peoples dime, and Hillary's gang is paid for by we the tax payer...Huge difference folksHave you noticed that when Trump has rallies, he speaks calmly directly to the people? When Clinton has rallies, she screams like a dictator? She kind of Hitler like.So,she was given the debate questions!! Ei CNN!!   And finally God pissed on her today at Florida ,she was stopped by a TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR.. That's Pathetic!
3 | Belinda L. Tramble | 355 | 10155561967771509_10155561978011509 | There's no way this is deadlocked.  I think they (the media) are trying to give Trump supporters some hope these last couple of days.  It's over; Hillary has this in the bag.  Our first female president!! I can hardly wait. :-)
4 | Jim Hasely | 149 | 10155561967771509_10155561972046509 | I used to hate Colin Kaepernick until I really did my research and realized that Kaepernick is a true American Patriot who's doing exactly what us Veterans fought for which was exercise his Constitutional rights. If you disagree with him fighting for liberty and justice FOR ALL, then you're part of the problem. God bless Kaepernick and the United States of America!
5 | Fred Kernisky | 122 | 10155561967771509_10155561975611509 | Brexit 2.0.Hillary is epitome of everything that is wrong with our  government and politics. Trump says mean things. Don't care. He has my vote.
6 | Farag Elkadiki | 95 | 10155561967771509_10155561979206509 | Congratulations president Trump from Benghazi for winning the presidential race for the white house .......Best luck for Mr. Trump, the new president of USA, and the good American people from Benghazi people, who are still fighting ISIS, Muslim brother hood gangs, and terrorist from all over the world which has been fully supported by Crooked Hillary administration..
7 | John Roscoe | 87 | 10155561967771509_10155561975421509 | Hillary really doesn't get me all that pumped up, just to get that out of the way. That said, the fact that Trump has the realistic chance that he has is absolutely mind-blowing to me... We've turned that office of the POTUS in to a prime time sitcom.
8 | Hank McArdle | 93 | 10155561967771509_10155561985101509 | Top four reasons Trump can't be our next commander and chief1. Risk of nuclear war2. Lack of basic understanding of the constitution and all matters foreign and domestic3. Risk of genocide against Muslims and expansionism with Russia 4. Tendency to assault and rape women
9 | Mark Thomas Hastings | 14 | 10155561967771509_10155562017746509 | Lance Armstrong was a hero after winning the Tour de France multiple times.  That is, until people found out he cheated.  He went outside of the rules and his fall from heroic to cheater was swift.  Hillary should be judged the same way.  She received the questions prior to at least one or more debates (there aren't that many debates), she and her campaign planted violent protestors at Trump rallies, and fabricated things like a Russian connection later proved inaccurate.  In addition, she was exposed for corruption in many areas along the way.  How can Americans stand by her side?  She won't be my President, just as Lance is no longer our bicycle champ, due to all of this...no matter the outcome.  Winning without cheating is graceful and the opposite is disgraceful
10 | Michael Strom | 21 | 10155561967771509_10155561983111509 | Lol L.A Times polls had Trump at 95% win and Trump is leading in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Nevada, he just needs to flip one battleground state and his won. The brainwashing lame stream media won't tell you this.
11 | Alex Zaft | 7 | 10155561967771509_1605454056416430 | I find it pretty comical watching all the people here trying to somehow convince themselves that Hillary is winning... Excuses, rhetoric, spewing hate, etc. None will help, trump will win this and will win this by a landslide. I can't stand trump, but I can stand her even more. Just being realistic here. God help us either way....What I find even more comical is that If Hillary Clinton was a Republican, the mainstream media would be taking all of the juicy tidbits flying out of WikiLeaks and beating her over the head with them until she tapped out and quit.Unfortunately, that standard doesn‚Äôt apply to liberal Democrats who get a free pass from the press, which is likely the only thing ‚Äî aside from Obama pulling strings ‚Äî that has managed to keep Clinton from acquiring a new orange wardrobe and spending her holidays in a cozy room at the federal penitentiary.
12 | Jerry Malone | 7 | 10155561967771509_1605449643083538 | i would trust peewee herman sitting behind me in a movie theater while out on a date OJ Simpson drinking at Bill Cosby's bar with Flint Michigan ice cubes after taking elevator rides with Ray Rice all while Casey Anthony babysits for me before i would trust Hilary Clinton as president. TRUMP!!!
13 | David Rosenthal | 14 | 10155561967771509_10155562007226509 | CNNs reporting this week has been atrocious after running for almost 2 days exclusively on Trump  up 1 in ABC/Wash Post poll....it has ignored +4 in the same poll today...how come? ratings? horserace? Reporting NV in red with trump +7 and ignoring what is actually recorded votes happening in early NV voting which points to a Clinton win already....Media like CNN will share in the responsibility if there is violence from Trumps side after being told its tight, and it ends up not being close...Disgusting
14 | Mary Kavanaugh | 7 | 10155561967771509_1154649217936397 | I am sure Donald J. Trump is much farther ahead than you are reporting. We understand. That last ditched effort to get as many Clinton Supporters to the polls as possible. We have read Wikileaks. We know the networks that are owned by The Clinton's. Better you than any of us. You owe, You owe, You owe. Donald Trump For President
15 | Matt Abel | 3 | 10155561967771509_1154674424600543 | CNN smartly doesn't allow people to post pictures, because if I could, I would post the emails from Wikileaks detailing the exact plans to inflate Clinton's polling numbers to suppress Trump supporter's enthusiasm. Wikileaks is easy to search, check it out.  Trump has never trailed, and is currently at his highest point.  He had between 58 to 64 percent support before the announcement of the second FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information. It has been mostly overlooked that the FBI announced they were also investigating Hillary Clinton for bribery, public corruption, perjury, and obstruction steming from her foundation.notoclinton.com
16 | Chris Shipman | 10 | 10155561967771509_10155562030771509 | Trump has been higher in the polls . The media including CNN just chose to Dr. those polls to manipulate people into thinking Donald Trump was losing. Now they are having to slowly admit that Donald Trump is winning.
17 | John C Zolla II | 14 | 10155561967771509_10155562018696509 | Stop, just stop! There is no way in Hell they are deadlocked. We all know your network has no shred of honest reporting left in any one bone in all of the population of earthlings combined... Trump will be our next President for the next 2 terms...
18 | Dan D'Antin | 6 | 10155561967771509_1154655457935773 | why doesn't CNN report what is really happening? ..Hillary Clinton's latest uncovered batch that shows classified info was sent to Chelsea Clinton. Wow, will America be safe under HRC?
19 | Cranston Burke | 1 | 10155561967771509_1605481096413726 | Americans can either choose Hillary Clinton who's careless with emails and actually apologized for it or Donald Trump who:‚Ä¢ Called all Mexicans rapists.‚Ä¢ Claimed the president was born in Kenya.‚Ä¢ Proposed banning an entire religion from entering the United States.‚Ä¢ Publicly mocked a disabled reporter.‚Ä¢ Said John McCain wasn't a war hero because he was captured.‚Ä¢ Attacked the parents of a fallen solider.‚Ä¢ Bragged about committing sexual assault.‚Ä¢ Was accused by twelve women of committing sexual assault.‚Ä¢ Said some of those women weren't attractive enough for him to sexually assault.‚Ä¢ Said more countries should get nukes.Said he would force the military to commit war crimes.‚Ä¢ Said a judge was biased because his parents are Mexican.‚Ä¢ Said women should be punished for having abortions.Incited violence at his rallies.‚Ä¢ Called global warming a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.‚Ä¢ Called for his opponent to be jailed.‚Ä¢ Declared bankruptcy six times.‚Ä¢ Bragged about not paying income taxes.Stiffed his contractors and employees.‚Ä¢ Lost a billion dollars in one year.‚Ä¢ Scammed costumers to his fake university.‚Ä¢ Bought a six feet tall painting of himself with money from his fake foundation.‚Ä¢ Has a trial for fraud coming later in November.Insulted an opponent's looks.‚Ä¢ Insulted and opponent's wife's looks.‚Ä¢ And bragged about grabbing women by the p***y.
20 | Casey Chapman | 11 | 10155561967771509_1154653924602593 | I truly hope this cannot be true. How this man gets ANY votes I'll never know. Not in my house! Not in my city (Chicago). Not in our country. I'm blue all the way down the ticket - and especially proud to cast a vote for Hillary Clinton. Never happier to cast a vote
21 | Joanne Lynn | 1 | 10155561967771509_1154669704601015 | The silent majority may put Trump in the White House. Many don't share who they support out of fear of being called a racist or getting attacked if they say they support Trump.  Ending illegal immigration, securing our borders, destroying ISIS, and bringing back outsourced jobs are priorities for many Americans and legal immigrants who are now citizens.
22 | Christine Demyan | 26 | 10155561967771509_10155561983491509 | Bill Maher summed it up well:  ‚ÄúJesus healed the blind, Trump mocks the handicapped. Jesus turned the other cheek, Trump grabs your p*ssy. Jesus turned water into wine, Trump just whines. The Bible says, ‚ÄòThou shalt not covet they neighbor‚Äôs wife.‚Äô Trump says, ‚ÄòFine, what about my daughter?‚Äô‚Äù
23 | Jeff Uzor | 13 | 10155561967771509_10155562029431509 | Sorry guys Donald Trump cant win the presidency. If he were running against Jesse Jackson maybe he will. But folks he is running against Hillary, an experience machine and Donalds rhetorics has made it very very impossible for him to win the general. You guys can hope all you can but hey is done deal.
24 | Joseph Nolan | 1 | 10155561967771509_582200498631929 | With wiki leaks and Project Veritas revelations on top of the FBI investigation this shouldn't even be close. It just shows modern democrats/progressives don't care if they elect corrupt politicians just as long as they get their ideological agenda pushed through
25 | Naomi Partington | 9 | 10155561967771509_10155562010416509 | Ahhh, the never ending story of rich men telling poor men to blame other poor men for the fact that they are poor..... nothing will ever change until this is deconstructed, and Trump is the biggest rich con man of them all to scapegoat his privilege onto all other groups.... he has no place going anywhere near the White House.

1 | William Petto | 33 | 10155561793446509_10155561800276509 | Regular small spiders are misunderstood. This one, though...nopity nope nope with a side of big ol' nope.
2 | Mary Ryles | 7 | 10155561793446509_10155561974671509 | Did you know that there was a scientific study done that showed that the average Aussie had these spiders crawl over their face an average of over thirty times while they are asleep?  O.o
3 | John Visser | 2 | 10155561793446509_10155562377136509 | I love the huntsman - get heaps of them in the house over the summer. Just shuffle them out if there is no food or the doors are closed. If there are flies or mozzies around, let them have a feed first. Never had one walk over my face, ever - and have had plenty in the bedroom. Also trainable - had one come out inside the patio roof once - played with it with my torch - shine the torch on the roof next to  it and a moth would fly into the spot SNATCH the huntsman got it. Took only a couple of moths before the lucky and soon to be well-fed spider worked out if it followed the light it would get fed...

6 | Stacey McQuestion | 17 | 10155561793446509_10155561828166509 | Why is it okay for President Obama and Hillary Clinton to go after the black vote and the Latino vote and that's not considered racist ? But if Donald Trump went after the white vote he would be labeled the head of the KKK white supremacist racist, is that fair? ALSO can someone post Jay Z speech from Cleveland. He used some pretty filthy words but that's ok also I guess.

7 | Kristin Wix | 90 | 10155561708736509_1832827133619646 | She is not who should be the first woman president!! Come on she has lied, committed treason, has been responsible for the deaths of 4 Americans!! Have you all forgotten?

Donald J. Trump slammed Hillary Clinton for the profanity-laced performance by rapper JAY Z, who was enlisted by the Clinton campaign for a concert in Ohio http://cnn.it/2f5c3vj
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Paola Alvarez | 2256 | 10155561681886509_10155561695571509 | Oh shut up you hypocrites!!! My goodness! You guys are offended when Jay-z uses profanity, but not when this clown says it? Oh wait, but now let's flip it around right? You guys are a joke!
2 | Prinz Kelvin | 1871 | 10155561681886509_10155561691731509 | I enjoy watching people trying to explain common sense to trump supporters. It's like trying to show zombies directions.
3 | Chris Tateham | 910 | 10155561681886509_10155561698356509 | Hillary Clinton took out Bin Laden. She has experience in the war room. The temperament to keep control under pressure. Trump gets upset over SNL skits. Mic drop.
4 | Noelle Kuder | 730 | 10155561681886509_10155561707981509 | So it's not ok for a musician to use profanity in his lyrics but it's ok for a "man" running for president to talk about grabbing pu**ies and telling people to go f*ck themselves?
5 | Sternlicht BJen | 513 | 10155561681886509_10155561695891509 | Jay Z isn't running for president!Put your big boy pants on Trump! There are more important things to discuss!!Maybe he should have talked about grabbing women by their p-ssy.
6 | Hank McArdle | 363 | 10155561681886509_10155561712606509 | Top four reasons Trump can't be our next commander and chief1. Risk of nuclear war2. Lack of basic understanding of the constitution and all matters foreign and domestic3. Risk of genocide against Muslims and expansionism with Russia 4. Tendency to assault and rape women
7 | Alex Smith | 294 | 10155561681886509_10155561712196509 | Well, I'm tired of Trump bullying women, disabled people, immigrants, muslims etc.. That's why I'm voting Hillary Clinton as President of the United States America! God bless everyone. #Historyinthemaking
8 | Wallie Gee | 161 | 10155561681886509_10155561736001509 | Does not matter what Trump says.....at the end of the day Tuesday November 8th, Trump will have lost the election and America will have elected Hillary Clinton as the next POTUS! End of Story!
9 | Scott Shobar Simoni | 92 | 10155561681886509_10155561738181509 | Jay-Z is a rapper, profane language is in the job description. However, the president of the United States of America is supposed to be an eloquent, well spoken individual & exude some class. All things Donald Trump is not & will never be........ I was taught at a young age that you cannot speak rationally to irrational people(Trump voters)-it does not work.
10 | Emmanu El | 186 | 10155561681886509_10155561728711509 | Sorry Trump Jay Z is not running for office, stop acting like a kid. you have had snoop doggy in your shows and he said worst. Please, this is unethical of a presidential candidate comparing himself to an entertainer. Bad Example! sorry Excuse for  your sexual conducts. JaY Z will not be in the oval office, its either  you or Hilary, so come on man! stop being an idiot.
11 | Amaury Francisco Guerrero | 73 | 10155561681886509_10155561695331509 | I would trust PeeWee Herman sitting behind me in a movie theater while out on a date with Lorena Bobbit at Bill Cosby's bar with Flint Michigan ice cubes after taking elevator rides with Ray Rice all while Casey Anthony babysits for me before I would trust Hillary as president.
12 | Davice Marcy McBride | 48 | 10155561681886509_647253432115404 | But this guy tells people to "f*%*" themselves on national tv! Then he says he'll bomb the "s*%#" out of someone. The list goes on and on of the profanity that HE personally uses. I don't agree with it either way but he is a hypocrite for even bringing it up!!
13 | Nicholas Wise | 44 | 10155561681886509_10155561695046509 | Donald Trump sure is one to talk with with own profanity laced language
14 | Vee Boh | 39 | 10155561681886509_10155561741381509 | I am not a jay z fan ,but when it comes to hypocrites Trump takes the cake .At least jay Z isn't fake .He just mad because no one is singing nor rapping at his events .
15 | Tina Burke | 30 | 10155561681886509_10155561738941509 | This guy is a joke right? A big joke that the USA is playing on the rest of the world right? Because THIS arrogant brainless sexual predator bigoted true born racist CAN NOT possibly be the leader of the free world...so come on America time to throw your hands up & laugh down the camera and shout "Just kidding" üò∂
16 | Tarek Abdel Aziz | 27 | 10155561681886509_647252942115453 | Donald's minions are so funny. They are offended by the profanity in a rapper's song but when "When you're a star they let you do it" hit the charts a few weeks ago they didn't seem to be bothered. The mysterious mind of a Trump minion skews logic and common sense and boosts hypocrisy.
17 | Claudio Torres | 24 | 10155561681886509_10155561718911509 | The hypocrisy of the trump campaign is huge. Your candidate has used more language on the campaign trail than anyone. Also, Jay-z is an entertainer, you are running for president. HUGE difference
18 | Tina Jones | 26 | 10155561681886509_10155561713381509 | Maybe he is just jealous because his celebrities are Ted Nugent, Kid Rock, Scott Baio, Antonio Saboto Jr., Kirstie Alley, Pete Rose, Dennis Rodman, and so many other train wrecks.
19 | Ulises Pastrana | 30 | 10155561681886509_10155561711336509 | Is so funny seeing how this guy -pretending to be a candidate- act like a kid: if everything is by my side is good but against me is repulsive. Oh Trump and his supporters, are you jealous because no one with a big name is campaigning for him ??
20 | Jeff Jorrell Drayton | 24 | 10155561681886509_10155561738786509 | Jay-Z is an artist and not running for the Highest Office in The Land you idiot lol. Trump's brain doesn't seem to understand the difference ..which is probably why he won't be declared president on November 8, 2016. üòèüëåüèæ get ready to lose Big League Mr. Orange Guy üòÜ
21 | Patricia de Geus | 39 | 10155561681886509_10155561707166509 | Every word out of Trump's mouth is a lie and he's used profanity in his rally speeches. Oh, and he's sexually assaulted women. But he's somehow offended by a rapper?! Trump is a "big league" hypocrite!
22 | Rosalyn Gardiner | 27 | 10155561681886509_10155561723231509 | But it's okay to grab em by the pussy's I suppose. Yep rape"y" talk and assaulting women is better. You know how you Trump supporters are always saying, ‚ÄúHe tells it like it is‚Äù? Let me remind you of something. Racism is not new. Xenophobia (the dislike or suspicion of anyone not from your country) is not new, either. These things have been around for centuries. We all have them inside us, but we keep them under wraps. You know why? Because we are civilized! Civil-ized! We know not to walk around mouthing obscenities or insults or racial slurs‚Ä¶we know we have to live together on this one planet; there is nowhere else to go. In the past, when we let those racial insults enter into our daily interactions with other human beings, wars happened‚Ä¶people were killed or maimed; horrors of ferocious magnitudes were unleashed upon ourselves. So we learned to keep our mouths shut and be civilized toward each other. There is no other way! Those suspicions and disdain will always be with us; what keeps us as decent civilized people is we keep them under control. Under control! Donald Trump urges you to let those racial and xenophobic emotions loose, and you have forgotten why you kept them under control originally. He is not, ‚Äútelling it like it is‚Äù; he is telling it like it isn‚Äôt! And like it should not be! We have come a long way toward being a civilized society; and the rest of the countries in the world all participate in the maintaining of a civilized society. Why would you even consider letting Donald Trump undo that? Don‚Äôt regress into the cave-man anarchy where everything is uncivilized. Get yourself under control‚Ä¶and vote blue.
23 | Jay Serrano | 21 | 10155561681886509_10155561745056509 | Wasn't it just last week one of his surrogates said an inappropriate Hillary Clinton joke? Lmao @ him talking about someone else saying disrespectful things, this guy is such a hypocritical cry baby, which is why he's losing.....
24 | Joseph Dutch Gentil | 9 | 10155561681886509_647256008781813 | clinton can't draw crowds on her campaign trail so she hijacks at a cost a concert. jay z and beyonce netted $400,000 for that. How disgracefully pathetic.
25 | Mike Harris | 10 | 10155561681886509_10155561740506509 | Ahem, what was he saying about "grabbing them by their p_____"?   The sad thing is so many people have bought into this faker.  I'm for economic fairness and justice, but have no illusions that he will bring back the millions of US footwear, garment, textile, electrical manufacturing, basic steel and so forth jobs.  And I feel so bad that countless hardworking folks, of all colors, have lost their jobs, yet some think they will be brought back by the king of outsourcing himself.

The next US President will inherit a world with the toughest array of foreign policy challenges in decades.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Andy Charles | 161 | 10155561595981509_10155561600936509 | Yet Obama has a high approval rating ? Ha. Democrats are so out of it. They care more about saving the rainbows and open borders than things that matter, like national security, healthcare, and the economy. We are in huge trouble if Hillary wins.
2 | Hugo Nunez | 107 | 10155561595981509_10155561615561509 | So we shouldn't vote for someone that sells weapons to terrorists, right? I got you CNN, I see what you're trying to say. üòâ
3 | David Halahmy | 42 | 10155561595981509_10155561599401509 | In just a few days our nation will take a another step back. Regardless of who is our next president. We have endured 8 years of rising debt (from 10 -20 trillion), growing Islamic radicalism, massive increases to our heath care and sadly a more divided nation then I have ever seen in my life. And neither of the two folks who will be sitting in the white house will do much about those issues. But I still have hope that one day our nation will find its path again. Neither Hilary or Trump will make your life better. That is up to you. I suggest a heavy dose of individual responsibility for the next stage of American History. If you work hard, be a good husband, wife, neighbor you will hopefully stay on your feet. It will be a historic day, we will elect a reality t.v. star celebrity to be president, or a person under FBI investigation who should be indicted. I pray one day our nation will find its exceptionalism again. And no one should look at either of these people as a "role model"
4 | David Johnston | 61 | 10155561595981509_10155561600526509 | That's because Obama was a horrible president. He made us substantially weaker on the world stage.
5 | Andrew Wickens | 43 | 10155561595981509_10155561609866509 | Wasnt hillary in charge of the state department as all of our foreign policy started taking a dump?
6 | Eric Napier | 20 | 10155561595981509_10155561655151509 | No worries. We'll just have Trump! Because he has a plan. We don't know any details whatsoever, or if he even has the cognitive ability to think beyond two days or so, but he has a plan!
7 | Steve Bell | 11 | 10155561595981509_10155561623246509 | Trump foreign policy will be to ignore and retreat from the rest of the world, this may not be a bad thing, less meddling in issues where their not wanted
8 | Kemi Olatunji | 8 | 10155561595981509_10155561984386509 | Thanks to the recklessness, Shambolic, and senseless Obama/Clinton foreign policy. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote to cover up the systematic failures of the Obama administration, and the continuation of the same.
9 | Scott Downer | 17 | 10155561595981509_10155561629046509 | Hillary Clinton would down size our Military while open borders and visa"s are handed out like food stamps and could not protect a hot dog in a the heath food section in a shopping Mart..Clinton is a war hawk. If anything is a real concern it's that she would have us more involved than we've been the last few years .With Cyber attacks to our democracy it is an act of War hacking in to .. If they are doing it .. But lets talk Hillary Clinton her support in the Mid-East Religions and hype going on " genocide " . Look at the Structures of History destroyed as Secretary and people getting slandered and her corruption with the FBI and CIA gun running .. She as no control or structure to peace and the sanctions for Nuclear weapons .. Have no faith in her securing or the dismantlement of Nuclear Weapons
10 | Jeffrey Werner | 4 | 10155561595981509_10155561722846509 | The next president will only inherit the toughest array of foreign policy because Obama and Clinton screwed it up and screwed everyone over so bad.
11 | Rachael Dob≈°oviƒçov√° | 2 | 10155561595981509_10155561721456509 | And that's why we need that person to be Hillary. Trump knows jack about the rest of the world. And as much as his supporters don't care about the rest of the world, the president has to. Trump's already seen as a laughingstock by the rest of the world. It would never turn out well if he were elected.
12 | Dato Anak Wen | 1 | 10155561595981509_10155562342576509 | After Bush administration made chaos to the world... Americans highly voted for Democrats... After Obama took over the office til 8 terms, the previous voters blame Obama for the world he continued from Bush... The next new president living with the poops of Bush but people still blame for Obama and Hillary...
13 | Joe Mackojc | 0 | 10155561595981509_10155562532271509 | 'Many of the workers at the hotel are Latino and Filipino immigrants working in housekeeping and food service jobs. According to the Culinary Workers Union, the Trump workers on average earn roughly $3 less per hour than other unionized workers on the strip.In a statement Thursday, Geoconda Arguello-Kline, the union‚Äôs secretary treasurer, called on Trump to sit down at the bargaining table.‚ÄúThe National Labor Relations Board has consistently told Donald Trump and his company that the union election wasn‚Äôt rigged and that he must sit down and negotiate with the Culinary Union,‚Äù Arguello-Kline said. ‚ÄúMr. Trump is breaking federal law and Trump Hotel Las Vegas is operating illegally. Mr. Trump should accept the federal government‚Äôs order to negotiate and treat his workers with respect.‚ÄùUnlike most Republican presidential nominees, Trump has pitched himself as a candidate for union workers. He boasts of having ‚Äúgreat relationships‚Äù with labor unions, and claims he can raise wages and bring high-paying manufacturing jobs back from overseas.'
14 | Scott Bolinger | 2 | 10155561595981509_10155561639846509 | the next president will have to evaluate law enforcement and fed procedures. Many claims of inhumane treatement of protesters and political prisoners, he'll have to review the BLM and its land management scam. He'll have to work well and fix the diplomacy problems we have today and stop WWIII, he'll have to stabilize Iraq and Afganistan. He'll have to decrease taxes to prevent economic collapse. We are at our highest forecloser and bankruptcy in ever. He'll have to revamp the veterans program, to make them actually help veterans. He'll have to budget, so we can put money back into our military.

If anything, he has spent a lot of his own money on the entire campaign and Crooked Hillary has NOT. He's not a politician and because of that he's not politically correct and corrupt like most of the politicians in Washington. Trump really loves this country and the people in it and he knows that he is the only chance we have at a country that is free again, whose morals and values parallel those of our founding fathers. This country was built by God loving folks who wanted change - that‚Äôs exactly what Donald Trump is. He is not controlled by the special interests and the evil media and does not heed the negative stigmas that are placed upon him. He is driven by only one thing ‚Äì he knows that this country needs dire change and he is the only shot we‚Äôve got to save our country. So please, on November 8th ‚Äì go vote and go make a difference in this country. Aren‚Äôt you tired of the growing control the government has on our lives and the ALL the corruption and lies?

7 | Tre Millz | 22 | 10155561395526509_10155561448511509 | The only difference here is the race of the rapists. I'm still awaiting Brock Turner's 17 year sentence for his sexually predatory behavior. Oh and Donald Trump's for assaulting multiple victims, including a 13 year old girl, who has been forced to retract her statements because of multiple death threats by trump supporters.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jodie Featherston Moss | 320 | 10155561296286509_10155561314176509 | I don't like either candidate. However, presentation is important. The president is a representative, if you will, of our country. People from all over the world, our allies & enemies, judge us in large part, by the demeanor of our leader as he/she speaks. Trump has no filter. He cannot handle criticism. He cannot handle opposing views. He cannot handle a tough situation. He throws a fit like a belligerent, childish man, even during speeches. He makes the most obscure, immature, irresponsible remarks. All for the world to see. Hillary, is able to maintain her composure, at least act professional & has a filter when on camera. These qualities are very important when the world is watching.I had originally planned to vote third party. Now I've decided this election, isn't the election to do that. I'll be giving Hillary my vote to help keep sociopathic Trump, out.
2 | Zach Kerman | 170 | 10155561296286509_10155561303566509 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
3 | Byers Bart | 39 | 10155561296286509_10155561339566509 | Let me get this straight....if you break the law, put America's national security at risk, take bribes from foreign governments and lie about your criminal activity to the FBI and American people, then Obama will tell the American people that you should be the next president. Hmmm, interesting! Obama, you ever consider becoming a comedian?
4 | Jennifer McLean | 28 | 10155561296286509_10155561331701509 | I wasn't that surprised that Obama did the interview. (Weak as it was) He is certainly pushing hard for Clinton. I haven't ever seen a presiding president campaign for a candidate? Must be a very good reason? Fear is my guess, fear of what is to come out? Such a shame that it come  to this, embarrassed I'm sure for their corruption. They sure have a lot of money to spend for her. Looking forward to what will finally be revealed regarding these lying crooks!

6 | Kathleen Foudray | 28 | 10155561296286509_10155561320131509 | Hahaha, you gave Obama all the questions before hand, CNN also did that before the second debate with Hillary, CNN sucks
7 | Kelly Duffy Sage | 30 | 10155561296286509_10155561313596509 | Obama spent 9 TRILLION dollars for this anemic recovery, 9 Trillion without rebuilding our infrastructure, without taking care of our American Hero's, while depleting our military, destroying our decent health care, to make way for single payer, socialized medicine, while lying to us about it, our first african american president left his brothers and sisters to suffer in the inner cities without relief, and with the help of Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, created Chaos and death in the middle east, in Libya, in Syria, and allowed ISIS to rise in Iraq, the death toll is in the hundreds of thousands, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, and they call it a success.The United states is closer to war with Russia than we have been since the cold war, the Philippines, our protectorate and friend for generations has cut ties with us and is looking to join with china and russia, north Korea is launching medium range ballistic missiles into the south china sea, China has stolen our stealth technology and is using it to build their war machines, That is just the tip of the iceberg, we wont find out in truth, for decades, how much damage they have done, to this great nation.It is time for a change, Go Trump.
8 | Andrew Keen | 9 | 10155561296286509_10155561430701509 | Under Obama, more people in poverty, more people on food stamps, lowest labor force participation rate since 1972, household median income is down, a GDP growth under 2%, ISIS was able to flourish, NOT one country can be identified to have better relations under Obama, the National Debt has DOUBLED under Obama, race relations are at an all-time low etc. etc. O, wait, Obama does hold the record for most reality show appearances by a sitting President!
9 | Donna Burton | 8 | 10155561296286509_10155561354786509 | I'd like to know how it's OK that the tax payers are paying for Obama to campaign for Hillary Clinton instead of doing his job. Meanwhile the whole middle east practically burns and we are involved in war everywhere...
10 | Thad Cardine | 10 | 10155561296286509_10155561319901509 | During HRC's tenure as Secretary of State, it was like she was in a marathon for 4 years.....running as fast as she could to amass as much money while she had the opportunity in that position. And she amassed a fortune. The more she accrued, the more comfortable she felt. So easy! It was like taking candy from a baby! So much money and so little time! All the while, Obama didn't say a word.In essence, you could say that during that time, Obama, unwittingly, gave her more than enough rope to hang herself!Ahh.....power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely!

Unfortunately the enforcing of literacy tests & other unfair acts limited voting for American Blacks. Voting Rights Act of 1965 put an end to unfair literacy tests & other obstacles which limited American Blacks the right to vote. Vote!(written by Kymara Hazelwood) üôÉ
12 | Michelle Fernandez | 0 | 10155561296286509_10155561801406509 | Obama is a joke! He spent more time golfing and now campaigning for Crooked Hillary than working. Our country is more divided than ever thanks to him and Hillary. They promote hate group BLM and are against the police. No wonder they had racist cop hater Beyonc√© giving a free concert with her retired drug dealer husband. Pathetic! Trump doesn't need celebrities to draw a crowd. Time to drain the swamp and lock her up!!!

14 | Jim Spedden | 1 | 10155561296286509_10155562153401509 | Obama will sit down with anyone willing to stroke his ego. This is a poor substitute for journalism... Not just the interview, but the fact that CNN finds it "newsworthy"...
15 | Amarcas Young | 3 | 10155561296286509_10155561462216509 | Many black people have no idea of why the Democrat party is called "the party of slavery" . I reccomend they start reading here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War
16 | Brian Fitzpatrick | 0 | 10155561296286509_10155561591931509 | The real issue in the FBI investigation should be on Obama..this all went down on his watch. He is so pathetically incapable has know idea how to run anything.
17 | Gary Doan | 21 | 10155561296286509_10155561304811509 | We have witnessed the largest, most elaborate political coverup in history. Obama's Department of Justice, the Mass Media, the DNC and Hillary Clinton have almost succeeded, by attacking Trump. Their defense, was to go on offense and they flooded the media, with claims of violence, even rape. The violence was found to be planned and instigated by paid Team Hillary goons, who even rehearsed before hand. Their offense was all staged and fake. It‚Äôs all fake, the fake rape lawsuit was even dropped the week before the election. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt, dishonest politician to ever run for office.
18 | Ray Araya | 3 | 10155561296286509_10155561598366509 | Hitler blamed the jews and Hitler became the leader of Germans. Trump blaming illegals and Muslims, Trump can win. But Hitler lost the war because many kinds of people fight against the bad guy Hitler. So vote for Clinton and Democrats.
19 | Jonathan Greenstein | 1 | 10155561296286509_10155561360041509 | Whenever I get a package of plain M&Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the "loser," and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round.  When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars along with a 3x5 card reading, "Please use this M&M for breeding purposes."
20 | Hiram Weldon | 0 | 10155561296286509_10155561666341509 | If you elect Hillary, you teach your children to lie and manipulate other for your own self-interests and bring more terrorists to take revenge against US meddling in the middle East. Draining American's resources and give American all the part time jobs and high paying jobs shift to Mexico. Thanks Hillary for lie to US.

22 | Shalom Freund | 0 | 10155561296286509_10155562183171509 | It's amazing how crooked Hillary needs Beyonce, Jay Z and "Campaigner and Chief" - Obama to attract voters, while Trump is sweeping tens of thousands to his rally's all by him self.
23 | Frank Michel | 1 | 10155561296286509_10155561348751509 | Meh...a lot of vague "elaborate sounding" whitewash answers and Bill not pushing back on it like we're used to seeing on his show.
24 | Annabella Sanchez | 0 | 10155561296286509_1792765660996237 | (Saw this comment and had to share) If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in millions of refugees that believe gays should be executed?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you have are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Hillary's plan will open our borders and she will WRECK our Gun rights,The supreme Court, The economy,The pro-life cause,Military-Strength,Religious freedom,Freedom of speech,And American culture.A woman who covered up over 16 rapes of woman by her husband had plenty of people murdered, shared top secret documents, has donated and accepted millions from gulf state dictators who behead gay people on a weekly basis. I don't really have enough room to list all of her scandals but I'll just mention the ones that really make me cringe, like looting and vandalizing the white house before leaving, and how about turning the IRS into the gestapo, or murdering Vince foster or maybe leaving those 4 American soldiers without support in Benghazi to die, or maybe claiming that she came under sniper fire in Bosnia when that was clearly a lie based on video evidence, or maybe covering up all of bills dirty secrets, or maybe selling high tech secrets to China.We've already had to impeach 1 Clinton we don't need them back in the Whitehouse. #KILLARYFORPRISON2016

Donald J. Trump is on a four-state dash while Hillary Clinton plans on spending a lot of time in Florida
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Amaury Francisco Guerrero | 308 | 10155561205211509_10155561206696509 | Someone asked me how could I support Trump, a ‚Äúmisogynist, a racist and a bigot‚Äù.Here is why...Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think. Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist. Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.Because the Obama/Hillary regime have pissed up countries like China and Russia and thanks to their incompetence we are closer than never before to a global confrontation which could likely lead to nuclear war. Meanwhile Trump wants to work with Russia and find compromise unlike Obama and Hillary who stupidly and foolishly believe that they can bully Russia into submission..Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist. Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right. Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe? Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers. Because I fear for my family‚Äôs safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues ‚Äì which is a threat to our way of life. Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them. Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it. Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries. Because, unlike Hillary, he has actually created jobs, worked hard and achieved success. And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.
2 | Karen Johnson | 111 | 10155561205211509_10155561220341509 | Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (and has cheated on his wives). Elect him. Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. Put her in jail. 2 Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem. Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State).  So savvy... Put him in the white house. Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz. Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible. Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is. Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support him and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact. Your memes are not news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform.Alex Schiller
3 | Patty McCalister | 45 | 10155561205211509_10155561264556509 | I'm sorry to all of the Trump supporters out there... but just because he's the only candidate your party gave you doesn't make it right to vote for him. They should have given you all someone you can at least get behind for better reasons than he's not Hillary.
4 | Karl Keeling | 53 | 10155561205211509_10155561215511509 | Although trump is bad, he is no means worse then Hillary! Like Hillary and the Clintons have a massive line of dead bodies following them. Anyone who agrees to testify against them ends up dead. And Wikileaks has proven without a doubt that she is extremely corrupt and evil.

6 | Davis Emeribe | 37 | 10155561205211509_10155561214761509 | This is what all the fake medias like CNN, ABC, BBC,etc are hidden for the people to know, hillary Clinton make bill Clinton to refuse to acknowledge his son just because the mother was a black, any black that vote for hillary Clinton is an idiot and a fool, all they needs is black votes blacks life's don't means anything to them or matters to them, how long can we be used like a peace of paper, if you are a black then think about this, refused to be used, say the change begins with me and Trump is the change and not Clinton's
7 | Christopher Ortega | 16 | 10155561205211509_10155561329021509 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.PLEASE SHARE !!

9 | Shyam Krishnamurthy | 15 | 10155561205211509_10155561248116509 | I hate trump as a person, but I have to admire the almost strange way he is inspiring America. These are morally upright, tax paying , family oriented, community oriented people who are voting for this man. Well, whatever he is doing, the rest of the world doesn't get it and as usual proves, yanks are anything but predictable
10 | Peter Geedman | 16 | 10155561205211509_10155561252271509 | How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.  I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"By Bill Snow Jr.

15 | David Halahmy | 1 | 10155561205211509_10155561431931509 | In just a few days our nation will take a another step back. Regardless of who is our next president. We have endured 8 years of rising debt (from 10 -20 trillion), growing Islamic radicalism, massive increases to our heath care and sadly a more divided nation then I have ever seen in my life. And neither of the two folks who will be sitting in the white house will do much about those issues. But I still have hope that one day our nation will find its path again. Neither Hilary or Trump will make your life better. That is up to you. I suggest a heavy dose of individual responsibility for the next stage of American History. If you work hard, be a good husband, wife, neighbor you will hopefully stay on your feet. It will be a historic day, we will elect a reality t.v. star celebrity to be president, or a person under FBI investigation who should be indicted. I pray one day our nation will find its exceptionalism again. And no one should look at either of these people as a "role model"

Would honestly sY that is Ok?. It is not 4 lawsuits but 4000, ! I respect your choice but just look at the facts. But if your standards are that low, well good luck.
17 | Adam Perry Mason | 4 | 10155561205211509_10155561255086509 | What's funny is that a candidate as bad as trump can possibly beat hillary. It just shoes how bad hillary is. To bad Democrats are complacent when their party is taken over by a control group and do nothing to stop it. At the least the GOP didn't rig their hole primary so they could have a "chosen one". If bernie was the nominee ( which he could have been if the clinton machine hadn't been in place), this would be a no contest election. I suggest going over to reddit and read the compiled and fact checked information on what's going on in our government. This hasn't been seen since the days of hoover.

To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the "loser," and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round.  When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars along with a 3x5 card reading, "Please use this M&M for breeding purposes."

Donald J. Trump called a baby he brought on stage a "future construction worker" at a rally in Tampa, Florida http://cnn.it/2f4OMts
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Amanda Waddle | 2878 | 10155561029691509_10155561034461509 | What's wrong with that CNN? Something wrong with construction jobs??
2 | Luisa Inez Newton | 1610 | 10155561029691509_10155561036281509 | Trump displays a total lack of imagination in selecting "construction worker" as the poor kid's future. Donald doesn't have the imagination or brains to wonder if the kid could be a scientist or a writer, professions he fears out of ignorance
3 | Jamie DeHaven Bartlett | 936 | 10155561029691509_10155561051476509 | What is wrong with construction workers? Many make more money than college educated. Many ARE college educated! I know several that started out helping in construction and now own multi million dollar businesses.
4 | Anna Costa | 618 | 10155561029691509_10155561045811509 | Whoever is giving the baby to trump to hold should be ashamed of themselves he is going to court in December about raping a 13 year old. Why would anyone want to hand there baby to a rapist? Its disgusting.. he is a known pervert saying he would date his own daughter if she wasn't his daughter. He has no respect for children nor his.
5 | Sylvia Salas-Aguilar | 620 | 10155561029691509_10155561035676509 | Well what Trump has is thousands of trolls, he has a "trophy " wife without a voice of her own, and ZERO support from his own party to work for him because he has "shunned" them all!! And let's not forget his true friends/support... Giuliani who is an old psyco...Christie...  let's see.... where is the little dumpling today?? At his rally?? On no, sorry forgot... that event was cancelled wasn't it.... because the little dumpling by is in hiding! He's being investigated!! HahahaHILLARY2016!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô
6 | Kris Marasca | 253 | 10155561029691509_10155561053256509 | And, what's wrong with being called a future construction worker? Absolutely nothing, that's what. Those working a trade are just as important to this country as those working white collar jobs. Give it a rest Clinton News Network. Give it a rest.
7 | Roel Domenden | 221 | 10155561029691509_10155561043906509 | Future Construction Worker who will build another Trump Tower (somewhere in Mars) ..that's what he is talking about  hahahah.. ..Another DEPLORABLE thought of Trashy Trump...
8 | Colin Campbell | 122 | 10155561029691509_10155561060681509 | I know, being a blue-collar construction worker is so demeaning and deplorable. Only low-class, unintelligent people work with their hands to actually build things. Maybe he should go into lifelong debt to get a college degree in a field that isn't hiring graduates because they "don't have any experience."
9 | Stacey McQuestion | 149 | 10155561029691509_10155561036446509 | Why is it okay for President Obama and Hillary Clinton to go after the black vote and the Latino vote and that's not considered racist ? But if Donald Trump went after the white vote he would be labeled the head of the KKK white supremacist racist, is that fair? ALSO can someone post Jay Z speech from Cleveland. He used some pretty filthy words but that's ok also I guess.
10 | J Ron Mooney | 110 | 10155561029691509_1774836266123933 | How pathetic to see that nearly half the country is racist, xenophobic, misgoynistic, white-trash supporting a treasonous Russian stooge who shares and brags about those same vile personality traits. VOTE BLUE and for Hillary Clinton
11 | Tommy Odum | 88 | 10155561029691509_1315440245153521 | I'm a construction worker,  and I wish I had better focus during my younger years and didn't have to break my back to earn a living. Certainly an honorable living but not one we wish for our children. Right!!!???
12 | Ismael Roman | 69 | 10155561029691509_10155561049481509 | Make a America great again..a future construction worker..what a joke...why not a judge or a prosecutor..one that will put u in jail 4 rape..
13 | Joseph Sifuentes | 41 | 10155561029691509_10155561076176509 | As much as I hate Trump, calling a baby a "future construction worker" isn't a bad thing. CNN is now just looking for any little thing Trump says to make it a headline. CNN is looking pathetic.
14 | Karen McLean Lanfranca | 55 | 10155561029691509_896936730406269 | He's so gross! Looks like he's never held a baby before either. He should have said, this baby can be president one day. There isn't anything wrong with construction work, however, of all professions? this is what he chose to say?
15 | Humberto Sanchez | 38 | 10155561029691509_10155561038386509 | In 1927, Donald Trump‚Äôs father was arrested after a Klan riot in Queens: "I don‚Äôt know anything about David Duke, okay," Trump said. "I don‚Äôt know anything about what you‚Äôre even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. I don't know, did he endorse me? Or what's going on. Because I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists."
16 | Martha Romero Ostrander | 16 | 10155561029691509_1473100539371746 | He makes me sick üò°üò°üò°"future construction worker"really how about a doctor, lawyer or a great Republican Politician ! Of course his intelligence can't make him think! He is such arrogant man! üò°üò°üò°
17 | Marli Sepol | 20 | 10155561029691509_896943087072300 | It's because it' florida and probably he thinks the baby is from latino back ground...another show of his racism, ignorance and pretence....I have absolutely no respect for any one voting Trump...you are all brain dead and need a brain transplant, he is a total disgrace and an total A**h**e!!
18 | Kathryn Herkner Garra | 20 | 10155561029691509_925236460940938 | No, she isn't. Shorts, shirt, and sun hat. Nothing wrong with construction worker, but most adults that speak of the future of children reach for the stars...scientist, doctor,business mogul, PRESIDENT. Trump doesn't look at people and think of endless opportunities. He looks at people and thinks of ways to exploit them. He stiffs construction workers, and he does it often. My husband is in the business, and I can tell you that being stiffed or underpaid by 1 developer can break even a strong business and put the whole company in the unemployment line.
19 | Tina Jones | 12 | 10155561029691509_1763635480564840 | All you Trump supporters think about this. If Trump wins there is a good chance the GOP will impeach him and make Pence President. That is why GOP members have said they cannot support Trump, but they are voting for him. They do not like how Trump talks or what he has "promised". Even Pence disagrees with Trump on many issues. Not trying to start an argument, it just kind of makes sense.
20 | Anna Martinez | 18 | 10155561029691509_896958857070723 | Really "future construction worker" why because his rally is in Tampa Florida and not in upstate New York!!!!! And this is who you want for your for your president people of Tampa there with Trump?!? Really
21 | John K Gaddis | 27 | 10155561029691509_896933350406607 | America is already GREAT! Go find another line of work to ruin Mr. Trump. We do NOT want anything to do with your means and methods. Debt, catering to the white elite, no national plan for the country, etc. (Make America worse off than it is, IS the real campaign.)
22 | Joyce Nuwer | 7 | 10155561029691509_10155561063156509 | And, I hear all the time CNN pundits and Hillary referring to  Republicans as being less educated. So, your point is?
23 | Jason Austin | 16 | 10155561029691509_896940293739246 | I'm voting for Hillary because I want higher taxes, open borders, and war with Russia. I don't care if she is bought and paid for by Wall Street and the Middle East. Doesn't matter that she funds Isis. Who cares if she has failed miserably at every government position she has held. Trump said mean things. I surly can't vote for him.
24 | Ali Swanson | 8 | 10155561029691509_896966673736608 | He might be a future construction worker. There is NO shame in trade jobs! Someone has to build things. Someone needs to fix things. Someone needs to make and serve the food. What? You think these things happen by magic? Your cars magically repair themselves? Your plumbing magically gets fixed? No. People do those jobs. Skilled people. And that, has no shame involved.
25 | Shawn Gustafson Schwerman | 15 | 10155561029691509_1315434921820720 | I'm surprised he didn't say he would be dating her in 18 years. Plus, seems like a pretty loud place for a baby. Perhaps some noise reduction headphones if you insist on taking them to a political rally.

Donald Trump can Campaign 24/7 until Tuesday and he still Can't win. I will say he did better than anyone expected but to be honest he never stood a chance from Day 1.

4 | Luke Del Priore | 35 | 10155560940461509_10155560960151509 | They are stealing the election by requesting mail in ballots. A retired Navy friend of mine just moved to Maryland and when she went to vote they stated she already voted by absentee ballot and when she told them it was impossible they said they checked her address. She requested they check her name and they said they wouldn't. So she was not allowed to vote. This election needs to be fair!!! They need to stop stealing votes!!!!
5 | Dennis Gould | 19 | 10155560940461509_10155560987461509 | Deplorables, Needy Latinos, Taco Bowl, Basement Dwellers and Super Predators. Those aren't Trump words. They're offensive Hillary Clinton and DNC words used to categorize entire groups of people. Hillary says that Trump should be nice to people? Perhaps she should look in the mirror and lead by example.

8 | Dominick Borelli | 2 | 10155560940461509_10155561427861509 | Here is a fair question, if Hillary is for woman equality how come a man is running the Clinton Foundation? How come women make less than men in her own foundation??? How come her Campaign Manager is a guy??? You know Trump is the person to hire a women to be Campaign Manager in a Presidential Race. You do know Trump has had many women run companies for him.

Democrats are RUINING this country. And they dont even care. If the Clinton Corruption Crew gets into power, I know my family is done giving a crap about this nation anymore.

How does making comments about women over 12 years ago disqualify you from being POTUS? It doesn't. Besides; Hillary Clinton has enlisted the likes of Beyonc√© and Jay Z to represent her at her rallies. Their song lyrics are far more vile than anything Mr. Trump said so long ago.This election is not about gender or likeability; IT'S ABOUT THE ISSUES:1) Is he pledging to fill impending SCOTUS vacancies with liberal justices who do not respect the Constitution and refuse to base their decisions on the Constitution? If so, I would not vote for him. >>>Nope; Hillary Clinton is planning to do that.

VOTE FOR TRUMP.14) Does he boast about having more than 30 years of government experience as a reason to support him - but still cannot discern whether an email is classified without someone telling him? If so, I would definitely not vote for him. >>>Nope; it's Hillary Clinton who's boasting. VOTE FOR TRUMP.15) Does he boast about having defended children his entire life (and is even running on a platform of helping women and children) but emphatically supports and defends abortion until just days before birth - when the child can feel pain? If so, I would definitely not vote for him. >>>Nope; Hillary Clinton supports abortion. VOTE FOR TRUMP.16) Was he responsible for the deaths of 4 people in Benghazi? Did he have the audacity to stand at their caskets and tell their parents a video was responsible for their child's death (a lie)?

HE IS!!>>>Hillary Clinton pledges more of the same. VOTE FOR TRUMP.22) Does he claim to be offended by the language of his opponent and then, hypocritically, have musicians stump at his rallies using language that is BY FAR more vile and disgusting - in order to get votes? If so, I would definitely not vote for him.>>>Nope; Hillary Clinton is the hypocrite. VOTE FOR TRUMP.23) Is his party encouraging "immigrants" to ILLEGALLY vote? If so, I would absolutely, positively, definitely not vote for him. NOPE!>>>Hillary Clinton's party wants illegal votes. VOTE FOR TRUMP.What more do you need? It has been proven that Hillary Clinton is extremely corrupt and self-serving, and she lies constantly. We can see what effects her corruption and lies have had on America by observing the egregious state she has put it in.All of these things (and more) are why I will NEVER, EVER vote for Hillary Clinton and I pray that you will not vote for her either. This election is not about personalities or likeability; it's about the issues. If you consider the issues; Donald Trump is the only choice.I AM PROUDLY, EMPHATICALLY SUPPORTING DONALD J. TRUMP. **I have already voted for him!**PLEASE EITHER SHARE OR COPY AND PASTE - America will not survive if Hillary Clinton gets elected. VOTE FOR TRUMP!!

It's clear that Donald J. Trump is seen as a major threat to Mexico
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Troy Hawkins | 1477 | 10155560830216509_10155560842096509 | He wouldn't do anything about illegal immigration.  He and his rich friends get cheap labor from Mexico. Trump supporters are out of their minds.
2 | Ren DV | 729 | 10155560830216509_10155560831701509 | I've no doubt Donald J. Trump will get the White House! Hillary's over! After those questionable emails? Hillary's such a low life; that should not have been entrusted with anything or anyone.. especially when within her grasp the greatest authority!
3 | Christina Glenn | 493 | 10155560830216509_10155560840866509 | Keep building that BLUE wall.....Trump won't live in the White House if he is elected, he will build himself a castle. He wants to change our country to a dictatorship with him as the leader. He wants to destroy our democracy with his communist wife......wake up!!!!.....#nevertrump
4 | Dorman Leggo | 305 | 10155560830216509_10155560834586509 | No if.......Mr Trump is going to win, "Big League"!!!They say rallies don't mean anything, but look at the demographics. Trumps rallies are 20-50 times larger. And they are a majority of men and women 40-50. Large portions are people who haven't voted in decades or at all.The exact people polls never factor. 30 million boomers fall into that category. If only 20% find that his  message resonates?  That's 4-6 million people. Enough for a landslide in spite of vote rigging.Landslide Tuesday!!!!!!
5 | Alexander Apelis | 209 | 10155560830216509_10155560848281509 | Good. Illegals coming over here working under the table and sending money back to Mexico supporting their economy and not ours needs to stop.

11 | Joseph A. Kellermann | 38 | 10155560830216509_10155560887846509 | Of course Mexico would hate Trump. Where else would they dump off their drugs and poor people if the border was more secure?
12 | Ken Weger | 36 | 10155560830216509_10155560917766509 | It's Crazy that all these so called "PATRIOTIC " Americans want to vote for Trump. Let's see he ...doesn't pay taxes to build roads schools water treatment plants military border patrol etc .Thinks 50% of the population is there for his enjoyment ( if he thinks she's hot enough)Buys Chinese steel to build his buildingsManufacturers his merchandise in China Hires illegals. Yet this is the scum bag you want to vote for????
13 | Bill Scheerer | 36 | 10155560830216509_10155560910116509 | Good for Mexico. They should have a plan. The man is crazy lunatic racist who should be locked away, not dominating the press cycles each day. I may be moving there if he does win.
14 | Natasha Hilliard | 46 | 10155560830216509_10155560908486509 | I love how Trump thinks he can make all these changes to our country. I think he's failing to realize that he can't do anything without the cooperation of the rest of our government. He can say he's going to do whatever he wants, but when it comes down to it, he's going to be a do nothing (but tarnish our international relations) president. If you thought Obama's road blocks were severe...just wait until you see the blocks put in front of Trump if he's elected.
15 | Geno Burko III | 33 | 10155560830216509_10155560833411509 | Looks like Mexicans are flocking to the border assuming Hillary is going to win.Good luckPOINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary? She has left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her or knew too much!Who is left?
16 | Bryan Hutchens | 15 | 10155560830216509_1421213744558611 | Of course he is.  Mexicans by the hundreds of thousands come to the United States and send their money they make back south to family which stimulates Mexicos economy.  CNN pull your head out of the sand
17 | Marta Samhouri | 14 | 10155560830216509_1421222724557713 | He has no idea how NAFTA works. U.S. export lots of agricultural product to Mexico. Mineral Fuel, soybean, corn, dairy & meat to name a few. We import oil, machinery, optical & medical instrument along with providing various services for them in the technology field. All which is in the hundreds of millions on both sides. What about the U.S farmers & employees? They will all lose their jobs. How is he pushing "creating job" when he will be risking millions of jobs on both sides which will severely impact both countries. He is oblivious to this, among everything else. NAFTA doesn't come without it's flaws. It does make it easier for mfg to leave to Mexico to make more money and in many cases just to survive. There's also Canada and their import/export. They will be greatly affected as well.
18 | Terry Hoar | 11 | 10155560830216509_10155560891996509 | Lol, hypocrisy at its finest. Liberals don't want Russia interfering in the election but they have no problem stating what Mexico will do. You shouldn't allow one to influence and block the other just because you don't agree with them.
19 | Chuck Fox | 20 | 10155560830216509_10155560903586509 | Here's a scary contingency plan: Mexico can make an agreement with Russia or China to build and pay for TRUMPS wall... in exchange they get to place their missile defense on the other side pointing at the USA.
20 | Tonya Johnson | 13 | 10155560830216509_1421296904550295 | It's amusing how many people think someone who never did anything for the working class (except hire mostly immigrants) to clean his hotels. They think he's going to help them???? Really? He's from NY and he can't win in NY. That's because unlike these little red states they REALLY know him and all the corruption he's been "charged" with...not investigated to see if he's done wrong doing (a difference)...he's a crook. I wish people wouldn't get their info from FB or Twitter but really do their homework.  And Giuliani???????? Omg!!! He's always been affiliated with crooks. Google Bernie Kerik...& Chris Christy is going down. His team was found Guilty!!! All Trump supporters talk about is emails that have yet to come up with anything to charge her. Being investigated doesn't make u GUILTY. If u get pulled over by the cops everyday doesn't make u GUILTY! If they find something then you are arrested and charged.  Nobody said Hilary was going to be indicted except Trump and his hombres. Even Fox News retracted that statement but he keeps saying it because his followers don't know better.  It's sad.  No wonder most of his followers aren't educated. It's obvious their lives suck but trump isn't their answer.

A jury found Rolling Stone magazine liable for defamation over its explosive and later discredited story about a gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity house
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Antonio Rivera | 79 | 10155560748221509_10155560758141509 | GOOD, they nationally defamed a group of guys very publicly for something they ultimately didn't do and never happened. If I'm not mistaken enraged protestors were throwing stuff through the windows of their fraternity house and committing property damage so it's safe to say this magazine helped put them in danger too.
2 | Stacey McQuestion | 39 | 10155560748221509_10155560753961509 | Why is it okay for President Obama and Hillary Clinton to go after the black vote and the Latino vote and that's not considered racist ? But if Donald Trump went after the white vote he would be labeled the head of the KKK white supremacist racist, is that fair? ALSO can someone post Jay Z speech from Cleveland. He used some pretty filthy words but that's ok also I guess.
3 | Craig Osborne | 12 | 10155560748221509_10155560794881509 | Awesome!!!!!!! They ruined those kids with a fabricated story! But that's what liberals do, they fabricate, they smear, they ignore facts, anything to push an agenda......just like CNN!  It's sickening.
4 | Chase Tinkham | 3 | 10155560748221509_10155560954521509 | Good. I hope this plus the other case is still pending bankrupt this poor excuse for journalism trying to pass as a legitimate magazine. Its horrible what Rolling Stones did. They labeled them guilty without doing any investigative reporting what so ever. As a result a lot of horrible things happened to innocent people. You think Rolling Stones would have learned from the whole Duke lacrosse case. No matter who it is, or how credible you think they are. You can't label anyone guilty for any reason based on the fact you think the crime is hot button issue. When the only evidence so far is purely hearsay. You never know whether they are telling the truth. So you do your homework investigate or wait for a conviction. Just cause a woman calls rape, doesn't automatically make  the one she is pointing the finger at guilty. Literally thousands of women a year make false rape reports for lots of reason. They dont want their parents to think they are sexual active and want to stay the good girl. So of she gets caught it has to be rape cause my daughter would never do that. Another reason is racial. A white girl is caught with a black guy having consensual sex. She calls rape because her dad doesn't approve of her being with a black guy and she fears the punishment from her dad. Some call rape on men with money to try and get some of that money. The list foes on. These women who do cry false rape that results in someone doing time and later finding out it was a lie should face legal ramifications. Especially if it results in someone being put behind bars and later finding out it was all a lie. The girl who lied and put him there should face jail time. No woman should ever be praised for falsely accusing someone of rape because others believe it starts a narrative. To bad if you think a law like this is bad because  it could hinder someone from making an accusation of real rape.  Any woman that is against that should be mad at the women who falsely accuse and get innocent men locked up for sometimes up to a decade before the truth comes out.

Chelsea Clinton sees the irony in Melania Trump wanting to stop cyberbullying given how often her husband uses social media to call out his opponents
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Danilo Cardenas | 1472 | 10155560648996509_10155560651186509 | How about the irony of having Jay Z yelling racist remarks during the concert yesterday.
2 | Randy Lyons | 515 | 10155560648996509_10155560660301509 | Chelsea shouldnt say a word her Dad is Rapist and Her Mother attacks ladys that has been abused by her day and her parents are close to pedihile.
3 | Kathleen Topf | 333 | 10155560648996509_10155560654296509 | Melania Trump has not hurt anyone. You people know this. She takes care of her son. But yet, you sully her name. I will be glad when this is over.
4 | Sammy Ray Foxworth | 415 | 10155560648996509_10155560650211509 | HAHA. Her mom's one of the biggest walking cyber security threats out there!!!
5 | Diana Mayo | 147 | 10155560648996509_10155560706681509 | Let's clarify: Melania is trying to help stop the epidemic of children being told on social media to go kill themselves. This is a good thing for her, and our society, to try to end. Yet she's raked through the coals for it. Again, trying to help stop CHILDREN from killing themselves is GOOD. Apparently that's a little difficult to understand. You people cannot seem to take the ONE positive thing out of this circus and promote it. Instead you call her a hypocrite and make fun of her, thus perpetuating the problem.
6 | Jennifer Smith | 161 | 10155560648996509_10155560673371509 | Chelsea Clinton should be referring to her Dad's abuse of woman!  Bill Clinton is an womanizing accused RAPIST!  Bill Clinton was impeached and had to pay settlements to these woman!
7 | Sandra De Armas Marsh | 100 | 10155560648996509_10155560660346509 | This is also how I feel. It's almost over for me. Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!
8 | Cathy Marvici | 95 | 10155560648996509_10155560676046509 | Melania was talking about children being bullied by other children. Not someone speaking the truth about crooked Hillary! Funny it's bullying when Trump says something, but when Hillary tell her lies (plenty of them) that's acceptable. Well guess what.. that's a whole lot of us that don't buy it! Chelsea needs to look in her own backyard and all the garbage that pours out of it.. Her parents and her husbands family, along with her husbands crooked greedy socialist communist uncle George Soros!!!
9 | Karlen Mkrtchyan | 86 | 10155560648996509_10155560673806509 | Ironic is her mother destroyed lives of so many bill's women, but she says she is fighting for women. Ironic is her mother invited "role models' like Beyonce and Jay Z to pump up her eleven followers. Has Chelsea heard their lyrics?
10 | Pamela Smith | 30 | 10155560648996509_1069186433198758 | You're married to George Soros nephew! You are part of the corruption! Melania Trump was speaking about school bullying you moron!  What hypocrisy, when Killary verbally abused ppl calling them deplorable!
11 | Timothy Kornegay | 17 | 10155560648996509_1069172049866863 | Who gives a rat. Bill Clinton had sex with a 13 year old sex slave on an island. There is proof. Can't understand why any decent person would support criminals like the Clinton's. You Clinton supporters are the biggest fools in history. And you folks Have No Soul! Voting for criminals. And your proud of it too!
12 | Violet Parrish DAmbra | 26 | 10155560648996509_10155560751111509 | If my mother was out last night with JayZ campaigning to be President of the United States, I would be mortified. Times sure are changin'. Vote Trump/Pence
13 | Mikki Mack | 31 | 10155560648996509_10155560692056509 | Melania needs to instruct her maid and butler to clean off their own front door step at Trump Towers and wash her own family's dirty laundry before lecturing to others
14 | Lisa Smith | 33 | 10155560648996509_10155560691356509 | Chelsea Clinton is as crooked as her parents. She helps run the fraudulent Clinton foundation. She needs to be in prison too. The Clinton foundation is a criminal organization and is under FBI investigation.
15 | Gregg Walsh | 18 | 10155560648996509_1069154093201992 | Only Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress.Only Hillary Clinton in 1974 was fired from a job (Watergate Committee) for being unethical.Only Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails after she was ordered to hand them over to the Fed.Only Hillary Clinton had that same computer server wiped (BleachBit) clean by professionals.Only Hillary Clinton got the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughed about it.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about Benghazi.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about her emails.Only Hillary Clinton lied about being under sniper fire.Only Hillary Clinton lied about lying to the American people.Only Hillary Clinton was involved in "Cash Cow"Only Hillary Clinton has a long list of scandals.Only Hillary Clinton nationally belittled her husband's sexual harassment and rape accusers.Only Hillary Clinton is a career politician.Only Hillary Clinton will not release her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banks.Only Hillary Clinton is tied to Monsanto.Only Hillary Clinton was labeled " Extremely careless " about national security by the FBI !Only Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class.Only Hillary Clinton benefited from the DNC rigging an election !Only Hillary Clinton had to return stolen items from the White House.Only Hillary Clinton said the Benghazi victims parents where lying.Only Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her based on her gender.Only Hillary Clinton has no real accomplishments after a lifetime in politics.Only Hillary Clinton has never created any jobs.Only Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI and found to have put national security at risk.Only Hillary Clinton has had two or more movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics and integrityOnly Hillary Clinton was called "Broomstick one" by the Secret ServiceOnly Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would of simply told the truth in the first place ! Fact - all facts !Only Hillary Clinton regularly cussed out and belittled her Secret Service detail.Only Hillary Clinton#NEVERHILLARY #TRUMP2016
16 | David Whitfield | 29 | 10155560648996509_10155560668286509 | I would trust PeeWee Herman sitting behind me in a movie theater while out on a date with O J Simpson, drinking at Bill Cosby's bar with Flint Michigan ice cubes, after taking elevator rides with Ray Rice, all while Casey Anthony babysits for me before I would vote for Hillary Clinton!!
17 | Tylene Bergeron | 29 | 10155560648996509_10155560694436509 | Clinton News Network. How about stories about the Clinton's bullying and how Hillary repeatedly says, i don't remember in order to nor indict herself and the FBI calling Killery Incompetant.
18 | Jeff Hanson | 17 | 10155560648996509_10155560706251509 | She is GUILTY just like Mama is!Only the  ignorant can support this profoundly corrupt woman! She Belongs in Federal Prison already!!The 25 things that are truly important about Hillary instead of this left wing fluff:1. When did she know her husband was a serial abuser, and does she feel guilty for destroying his accusers?2. Explain precisely the trades made in the Cattle Futures scandal where $1,000 was turned into $99,000 in a matter of weeks?3. Why didn't she do anything to protect the Americans in Benghazi?4. Who is Saul Alinsky and why was he her mentor?5. When she was working on Watergate, why did her boss Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, call Hillary a ‚Äúliar‚Äù and ‚Äúan unethical, dishonest lawyer‚Äù and have her fired?6. What really happened with Travelgate?7. What really happened with the Rose Law Firm?8. What really happened with WhiteWater?9. What gave Hillary the right to see private FBI files of her political enemies in FileGate?10. Why won't she turn over her illegal server with state department e-mails to congress?11. Why does your foundation accept money from avowed terror states?12. What is her take on the Vince Foster "Suicide"?13. Why did she think she was entitled to steal the White House furniture when she left?14. Why do you lie even about things that mean nothing: lying about being under sniper fire in Bosnia, lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, or lying that your grandparents were immigrants.15. Should America be concerned that in ChinaGate, the 22 people that were convicted of fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the DNC were associates of Bill Clinton?16. Did selling stays at the Lincoln Bedroom to political donors make you feel like a wh)o(re?17. Does Hillary think Juanita Broadrick lied when she said on national news that Bill Clinton raped her?18. Is she still okay that Bill goes to pedophile island with Jeff Epstein?19. Why are there so many murdered and suicided people in the Clinton's immediate circle?20. Doesn't the fact that the Clinton Foundation has to amend 5 years of its tax returns for improper reporting imply that you were involved in an illegal RICO enterprise?21. Doesn't approving the Russian-owned Uranium One deal as secretary of state--because of illegal contributions to your foundation--in fact make you a traitor to this country?22. Was it wise to have at least four Clinton Foundation board of directors that have either been convicted or charged of the financial crimes of bribery and fraud?23. Why, Hillary, did you pay your female senate staffers 72% of what you paid your male staffers?24. When you represented an accused pedophile rapist, why did you laugh when you got him off even though you believed him to be guilty?25. She said she had one e-mail address, it came out that she had two; She said she had one device, it came out that she had two: She said none of her e-mails on her private server was classified, but when the State Dept handed over 300 e-mails the FBI redacted large sections of one, proving again she was wrong. Thus, Ms. Clinton, are you incompetent or just a congenital liar?Everyone should go on you tube and watch The Clinton Chronicles -- it will amaze you what a couple of psychopaths the Clintons really are!
19 | Michelle Haas Bornick | 12 | 10155560648996509_1069177589866309 | Wow Chelsea. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it? You're going to go after someone, who has a valid platform, yet doesn't go your way. Surprise surprise. Instead of picking on Melania, why don't you read some of the emails your own mother wrote about you.  She is definitely not one of your biggest fans.
20 | Hope Taylor | 12 | 10155560648996509_10155560758941509 | Please remember the difference is bullying and sharing facts and/or media reports.  Furthermore, Chelsea needs to remember it was her mother who bullied women raped by he father in to silence!!!!!! The Clintons should should stop throwing stones while living in a glass house!
21 | Sarai Tincu | 8 | 10155560648996509_10155560719166509 | "And isn't it ironic? Dont Cha think? A little tooooo ironic.... yeah I really do think." üé∂It's like Trummmmmmmpppp insulting everyone when his wife says bullying needs to stop. Its like him saying America needs to be greattttttt again when it's already a pretty amazing place. It having a guy saying he's financially brave, yet won't disclose his tax returns."
22 | Aura Vallejos | 5 | 10155560648996509_1069132593204142 | Manipulative psychopath... who is behind trump = PUTIN = CHAVEZ... Moscow leaves no doubt that wants to be the future President of the United States Donald Trump. According to the Kremlin, the Republican is "friend of Russia".
23 | Linda McCauley | 4 | 10155560648996509_1785030755103023 | I think this pretty much just sums up how idiotic this election has been. Has Melania even been shown her husbands tweets? If so does she even understand what she is reading? Does she realize the irony? I agree Melania has not hurt anyone and  should not be shamed. Whoever set her up for this is to blame.
24 | Brian Schalk | 3 | 10155560648996509_1069170156533719 | Oh good Lord ... if Hillary Clinton were this crooked, she would have to be the most diabolical super criminal of all time. To have the GOP try to crucify her for over 25 years and spend millions to only come up empty handed has to resonate with some level headed people? Right? Hillary should be flattered that you have this kind of respect for her and her talent of eluding the most powerful government in the world. Maybe, just maybe, she's not the crooked one?
25 | Gary Zeeks | 0 | 10155560648996509_1069266056524129 | Perhaps that little troll Chelsea Clinton should start an anti-rape, and sexual assault campaign.I think you should stay the hell out of it! You are a hideous little troll that made sure she married the money bloodline. As close as your mom is to the Puppet Master, I have no doubt that you were part of the package.Stick with scamming people through that f***** up Foundation of yours, you hideous little troll.

3 | Rick Higdon | 598 | 10155560538396509_10155560541371509 | I want someone to explain how a person ( Hillary Clinton ) can get questions and answers to a debate and instead of letting the world know Donna Brazile is trying to help me (Hillary Clinton) cheat....she used them in the debate? And since the world knows this....why is she allowed to continue to run for potus? If your caught cheating in ANY form of race(for the whitehouse or otherwise)you are disqualified. How is it she isn't disqualified. Please explain Hillary Clinton?
4 | Franky Matthews | 523 | 10155560538396509_10155560545201509 | Its funny that Hillary Clinton can't even fill a high school gymnasium, but the corrupt corporate media says she is leading in the polls against a man who packs stadiums. Riiiiight

You people need to learn some respect for your service Members and keep in mind the world watched this time around and are horrified. I hope the day after you are ashamed to have let this man speak on behalf of you. It's 2016 and like it or not republicans the world has changed. Trust me neither candidate is good for my country but I love yours like it's a little sister. My friend was able to get a Doctrine from MIT and work at an Ivey league school thanks to NAFTA ... The amount of racism is disgusting.... shame!
7 | Mike Ryals | 213 | 10155560538396509_10155560542071509 | If it wasn't for Wikileaks doing real objective journalism, we the people wouldn't know about the many many skeletons the Democratic Party have in their closet - and it's a lot of bones. The sad part about this, they're insulting our morality by trying to offer us Hillary.

10 | Lynn Dooley Deen | 85 | 10155560538396509_10155560583846509 | Do you, CNN know how all the early voters voted? Simply because someone is registered Democrat or Republican does not guarantee how they will vote. This election cycle has been anything but the norm.
11 | Sandra De Armas Marsh | 29 | 10155560538396509_1633524533606520 | This is also how I feel. It's almost over for me. Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!
12 | Jared Lehman | 20 | 10155560538396509_1301865759845178 | Most of you probably didn't read the full article.  But they make it seem like Clinton is winning Bc more registered democrats showed up to vote than republicans. But! If you read the full article, the whole down to the bottom, they buried the real truth of this article. That THEY DON'T KNOW who the votes were cast for. And I'd be willing to bet that they're for Trump.
13 | Patty McCalister | 27 | 10155560538396509_10155560611841509 | This whole election has become like a big bad Abusive relationship!! We have heard so many negative comments and media that we have become beaten down, to were we actually start believing it. We start hating one side or the other. As far as Hillary goes, I believe she's just been doing her job, the things she has done have not been done by her alone. Both Republicans and Democrats make the decisions. As far as Trump goes...it's still hard for me to believe that anyone would except his behavior as a potential President.
14 | William Byron White | 42 | 10155560538396509_10155560544216509 | Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. Dey's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that's about it.
15 | John Arthur | 40 | 10155560538396509_10155560572136509 | Please speak for the millions of children who did not get a chance speak for themselves. Don't let Hillary deceive you to helping murder babies. A vote for #Hillary is a vote to kill living human beings. Only heartless and godless persons can do such demonic violence to helpless children.
16 | Jamie Bertram | 25 | 10155560538396509_10155560547456509 | Good job on trying to discourage Republican voters. It won't work. Good try though. Nevada also voted for Obama twice so this wouldn't be a shock or a must have for Trump
17 | Jessica Patrice Thompson | 21 | 10155560538396509_1633527870272853 | Trump is depending on this unseen "forgotten" force of voters that are supposed to magically come out of no where to vote for him..... what he didn't consider was the number of Latinos coming out in droves to vote AGAINST HIM! Juntos somos fuertes!!!!!!
18 | Jose Alarcon | 23 | 10155560538396509_10155560590031509 | That what happens when a party and a candidate make racist, bigoted statements, and has the support of white supremacists and the KKK. The women vote, the Hispanic vote and the black vote will determine the presidency from now on.
19 | Ivan Osiris 'May | 13 | 10155560538396509_10155560606801509 | I love my city.... I can honesty say ive never personally encountered racism here in Las Vegas and from this report it appears that the people are not fooled by this irresponsible homophobic racist clown. Not that im for Hillary....Just dont think he is what America wants as a President.
20 | Cathy Lee Kaech | 24 | 10155560538396509_10155560548826509 | Bill Clinton tried to cheer up Hillary Clinton today by reminding her that Nelson Mandela wasn't elected President until after serving 27 years in prison.

22 | Starlette Nealy | 14 | 10155560538396509_10155560603101509 | Didn't you get the name wrong, Bill Clinton is the one who raped women. I know it happens sometimes, but I can't even imagine a nut case like you could ever mistake Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. Clinton the rapist, beats on women, his wife terrorizes women who say he raped them. His wife who has an illegal email/server, bleach bit, Benghazi deaths, Ambassador died and still no help from USA and she the Sec. of State. Pay for Play, 13 servers hammered, 39 times says she doesn't remember. Lies to the Mom and Dad's of the dead men in Benghazi. Most definitely mistaken identity! Right!
23 | Gary Zeeks | 7 | 10155560538396509_10155560598006509 | CNN is a third-rate rag who very few Americans trust or believe anymore. No matter who wins this election I hope the American people hold CNN, and the media accountable for what I believe is Unforgivable.There will be a day, shortly, that the American people will get their news from other sources. The Anderson Poopers,  and Don Squeeze My Lemon, Rachel mad cow, and the other paid Talking Heads from the Clinton Foundation will be lucky to find a job At Entertainment Tonight, and extra, where they can all Star Worship, and stargaze together and leave the politics to the professionals who know how to be impartial, and objective. This goes for everybody, all journalists who brought their objectivity, and commentary, and sold it as fact. This also goes for all the journalist, and I say that with a pain in my face as if being stabbed with an ice pick, who covered up the truth, and concentrated on the mundane.What you did to this country during this election cycle comma borders on Criminal. What comes to mind is what you did to Bernie Sanders comma on the last few days of the primaries. You basically told the American people that the election was all but over, and there was no need to cast your vote, I believe that was in New Mexico. You have no right to him, or suggest to any United States citizen but they shouldn't vote. Did you come right out and say don't vote? No. But those of us who have caught on to you a long time ago realize what you were doing. I imagine someone sitting at home getting ready to go to a polling station, and hearing your words, and saying the heck with it, I'm just going to stay home.I know you see the comments every day whenever you post something. I know you see the American people are fed up with you. I promise you : the American people will have our voices heard, and we will do everything we can to silence you.You have a lot riding on this election. Maybe Wednesday morning, Clinton will call you and praise you want a job well done. Or, mr. Trump will call you and tell you the game is over. Either way, the American people will not forgive, and we will not forget.
24 | Kimberly Mansfield | 8 | 10155560538396509_10155560570446509 | I hope as many people complaining on Facebook about this election would be at the polls Tuesday, thank God this election is almost over! no matter who wins us Americans will still need to be together to help things get done!
25 | Judith Ch | 3 | 10155560538396509_1633522136940093 | According to you CNN? do us all a favor, stop reporting, you are no longer considered journalists. TMZ called, they have positions for you all. wolf, you should've jumped ship a long time ago, you all have lost credibility
