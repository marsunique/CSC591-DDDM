1 | Anthony Trivette | 345 | 10154750198491336_10154751867566336 | Probably gonna be fired because it's against company policy, but good for him, he gets to go home alive.
2 | Mark Zwald | 182 | 10154750198491336_10154751868886336 | I don't know about you but I feel perfectly comfortable having the average citizen be judge, jury and executioner with little to no training.
3 | Chris Arria | 121 | 10154750198491336_10154751869221336 | Barack Obama disapproves of this brave person's actions. They should have let them rob the store, and just begged the robbers not to harm anybody instead of resorting to sickening gun violence. Reasoning with criminals is always the logical approach to take when your life is in danger, according to every Democrat.
4 | Ryan Myers | 141 | 10154750198491336_10154751866791336 | Remember when Trump was laughed at for saying Hillary had the questions ahead of time? Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.#MAGA #Trump2016
5 | Martin Meyer | 102 | 10154750198491336_10154751867866336 | So what? He's protecting customers and fellow employees. Only feminized liberal men would oppose something like this.
6 | Kevin Edmonds | 65 | 10154750198491336_10154751866871336 | The left will find some way to label him as a racist fascist gun-loving bigot.
7 | Hannah-Rose Harding Pepe | 35 | 10154750198491336_10154751889566336 | As long as he had a license to carry, good for him. If he broke company policy, so what. At least he's alive and can go find a job somewhere else. And for all of you crying over the idiot he shot... don't wanna get shot? Then don't attempt a robbery!
8 | Matt Spano | 21 | 10154750198491336_10154751881086336 | Ahh liberals idiots are out tonight. Play stupid games like robbing people and win stupid prizes. Like being shot by someone who is smart enough to protect themselves and not be a liberal sheep.
9 | Jerry August | 23 | 10154750198491336_10154751875036336 | Good. Less money wasted on a trial and prison upkeep. Too bad he was only able to delete one of the three thugs from their useless existence. üòÅ
10 | Brad Steinberg | 42 | 10154750198491336_10154751867961336 | Heroes are not celebrities or athletes. Heroes are people like this employee.
11 | Jason Martin | 9 | 10154750198491336_10154751885856336 | That's just not right. Had that employee not had a gun, the armed robbers would have known and put their weapons down because criminals have ESP you know. Good for him. Glad that store didn't get robbed and NO INNOCENT PEOPLE WERE HARMED
12 | Jon Handel | 7 | 10154750198491336_10154751889161336 | I really hope the shooter is white and the dead suspect is black. I'd love to hear the #BlackLivesMatter clowns explain that one.I really don't care their skin color. Could be a Latino guy shooting a white dude for all I care. I just enjoy seeing hypocrites flop and twitch as they come up with something clever to say.
13 | Michael Strauch | 2 | 10154750198491336_10154751894451336 | I ran one of these 30 yrs ago and it wasn't open until 1:30 AM. There was one attempt on my life to steal the proceeds and after that I went out to the bank armed. Jobs were real hard to find then but when I got the chance I left.
14 | Alex Stelling | 8 | 10154750198491336_10154751883321336 | What are the chances another armed robber goes into that Pizza Hut? That has to be one of the safest restaurants in the world right now!
15 | PeggyMarie Sees | 4 | 10154750198491336_10154751885306336 | Great job! More of this would rebuild respect for others Property and set boundaries they obviously were not taught as a child.
16 | Marissa Cardin | 4 | 10154750198491336_10154751890721336 | What's sad is he'll probably be fired for having a gun at work üôÑ but he's alive, and so are the other people that were there too
17 | Steven Grotano | 0 | 10154750198491336_10154751903966336 | I'd give the guy a raise! You hear stories like this and sometimes the employee gets killed for no reason,it's either me or him and it certainly aint gonna be,especially if I'm carrying
18 | Bassam Tawfeeq | 0 | 10154750198491336_10154751874841336 | What I am about to tell you are facts:Only Donald Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women. Only Donald Trump didn't know the military didn't have a court system to deal with rapes in the military. Only Donald Trump talks about knowing more about ISIS than the generals yet he had his daddy buy him 5 deferments from the military to avoid military service. Only Donald Trump has gone bankrupt six times. Only Donald Trump has openly used donations to veterans collected then deposited to his personal and illegal foundation and use that money to pay for lawsuit settlements, but a self portrait, a signed football helmet and "donate" to the Florida attorney general so she wouldn't open and investigation in to the plethora of fraud complaints against his so called trump university. Only Donald Trump has over 200 lawsuits for fraud and racketeering pending in court. Only Donald Trump would have a pro Russian lobbyist as his campaign manager. Only Donald Trump would illegally do business with Iran, Russia and Cuba when it was illegal to do so. Only Donald Trump has zero political experience. Only Donald Trump is despised by the leaders of his own party which will severely limit what he can accomplish if he wins. Only Donald Trump has alienated world leaders. Only Donald Trump wants the proliferation of Nuclear weapons. Only Donald Trump made racist comments about Mexicans, Jews and Muslims. Only Donald Trump publicly made fun of a person with a handicap. Only Donald Trump called for women to be punished if they had an abortion. Only Donald Trump told his supporters to hurt people protesting at his rallies leading to people getting sucker punched as they left. Only Donald Trump has not released his tax returns. Only Donald Trump admitted to not paying federal income taxes. Only Donald Trump has called women fat, pigs and disgusting etc. Only Donald Trump blames the media for publicizing things that come out of his own mouth. Only Donald Trump has said he will support a peaceful transition of power but only if he wins. Only Donald Trump talks about keeping jobs in the US then sends his own company's jobs overseas. Only Donald Trump talks about the importance of improving the state of our economy and then used steel from china and room furniture and accessories from foreign countries to build and furnish his hotels.Should I go on? I still have the pending FBI investigation in to Trumps business dealing and campaign solicitation schemes! üò±
19 | Bassam Tawfeeq | 1 | 10154750198491336_10154751896011336 | Trump's conduct has really stuck in my mind, maybe because the media has focused on it, or maybe because he's bullied and mocked so many people in front of the camera.  He's not a good example or representative of Americans.  We are better than him.
20 | Samy Sam | 0 | 10154750198491336_10154751915211336 | You will see more of this because these thugs think they can do anything they please and get away with it. To bad he didn't get the other 2. Stand up and take your country back people and starts on November 8. Trump 2016
21 | Herbert Mcginnis | 1 | 10154750198491336_10154751898661336 | The sooner we get guns in all LAW ABIDING HANDS,the sooner armed crimes will will fall precipitously. WHY? Cause armed thugs are COWARDS.They don't have the  guts to face U knowing U MIGHT be armed. Someone once once said "Killmn all,let God sort them out
22 | Tina Brotherton Grogan | 1 | 10154750198491336_10154751901206336 | I love it! If more people would carry guns crime would go down but some people just don't get it. Burglers are cowards that want to take what is not theirs but they don't want to get shot/killed doing it.
23 | Oliver Rodriguez | 2 | 10154750198491336_10154751905201336 | He should've fought them off with love, and understanding instead......Wait, what?! Fuuuuccckkk that! Hats off to that employee! #UpholdThe2nd #FuckObama #FuckHillary!!
24 | Frank Pichardo | 3 | 10154750198491336_10154751876246336 | The government is really good at punishing people like this, but it's their ineptitude that has allowed thugs to run free!!!
25 | Erica Gandy Paddock | 0 | 10154750198491336_10154751904896336 | Good for him. He probably saved more lives than he took. If it's them or you, you shoot to kill. He has every right to protect himself and others.

"Hillary Clinton says, 'Donald J. Trump, oh he's not fit to serve in the Oval Office.' But she, and she alone, has created a situation that could do severe damage to this country and the office of the presidency."

6 | Amir Parvez | 91 | 10154751584941336_10154751787286336 | Hillary Clinton is a threat to American Democracy (what's left of it) and world peace. A vote for her is a vote for worldwide economic slavery and evil, endless war! She's a corrupt, evil, lying warmonger who already has blood on her hands of thousands of people and millions of dollars of blood money in the Clinton Foundation. #NeverHillary
7 | Aaron Ford | 30 | 10154751584941336_10154751802516336 | Disregard anything crooked Hilary says at this point. She's trying to put out multiple fires and has zero credibility. The only people dumber than her, are her supporters. Next
8 | Ted Burgamy | 42 | 10154751584941336_10154751799011336 | In a honest political system she wouldn't even be in the mix. Shows how low Americans have sunk. Voting for a person under criminal investigation

12 | Robert Anthony | 14 | 10154751584941336_10154751821401336 | In the year 2000 I had the privilege of working on Mr. Trump‚Äôs security staff in the Trump Tower. Let me just say that he is a real man, a real boss, and a real caring and loving person.He and his personal bodyguard Matt Calamari (now Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice-President) treated us like family and when we came into contact with Mr. Trump we addressed him as Mr. Trump, or Sir, not because it was something we were told to do, but rather out of respect. I hold Mr Trump in the highest regard.On 9/13/2001 I was walking out of the pile of concrete, steel, glass, and human debris that was Ground Zero as Mr. Trump was walking in. I think he was with Kevin or Brian (bodyguards), not sure which, but I addressed Mr. Trump and gave him a few breathing masks, then exited the site. This was months after I left the TRUMP organization for family issues.No more then one hour later I was receiving calls from Trump Tower stating that Mr. Trump was very proud to see me lending a hand to help our people and that they would like me to come back to work in the TRUMP organization.This is personal for me, and as a 100% disabled veteran fighting medical bills that the VA refuses to pay I know I need a man like Mr. Trump to stick up for people like me and for the rest of our great nation.God Bless Mr. Trump and God Bless America!‚Äù
13 | Micah Anne Miller | 5 | 10154751584941336_10154751824606336 | I don't know what scares me more: a Clinton presidency or the complete and total ignorance from her supporters.I have been blown away in disgust as I have heard countless Clinton voters tell me that Trump's a criminal while Clinton is being framed. I keep wondering if the zombies are coming next because we have truly entered Armageddon.
14 | Lynn Mullins-Hamilton | 3 | 10154751584941336_10154751826451336 | Yes....1000!Hillary is a liar and a crook.I fail to see how anyone who is loyal to this country, who wants our kids to live in freedom could vote for Clinton.It is disturbing to see and hear our elected officials stand back and do nothing and even condone her behavior and support her.They should be protecting our country, the people and doing their jobs to represent the people in pursuing justice, integrity, and honor.The FACT they are not doing it bipartisan shows they have corrupt skeletons in their closets and are terrified they will be exposed.Eventually it will all come out.Where are the people of this country standing?When talking to my daughter it is painful to explain that people don't care enough to stand up for our country.It's sad that american people have become so blind, willing to condone elicite, criminal, and corrupt behavior.She does not understand how people are letting Hillary Clinton do these things without consequences.It is hard for her to realize that the very people who have taught her to be, respectful, responsible, and safe....are only expecting her and her classmates to do it but it's ok for people like Clinton to do the things she has done.What can you tell a child? Its not ok and anyone who is condoning a supporting her is guilty. Its the truth and it leaves a bitter feeling in your stomache. The reality is you can't trust anyone to do the right thing, to support what is right, to demand truth, justice, and accountability,There in lies the problem with younger generations....they see and live in a world where they have been taught that certain people arebove the law and allowed to do whatever they want.So very sad....unfortunately it's the deity of who the people of this country have become.
15 | Miguel A. Santiago | 5 | 10154751584941336_10154751821596336 | We don't need to take criminal and dangerous refugees. That is not our problem and We are not making it our problem. Let them stay in their country to fight their wars. There is no benefit for bringing more terrorists to the United States than We already have. Liberals, get you heads out of your butts,
16 | Martin E. Morales | 9 | 10154751584941336_10154751811716336 | Hilary has damaged the image of our country. The entire world has been wondering why she is allowed to run, and at the same time why Obama is supporting her. Maybe they dont know that Obama is a Muslim traitor to this country.
17 | Linda Jones | 16 | 10154751584941336_10154751793641336 | If every American Loves this Country' then better vote for Trump' cause Democrats are selling us out' for Dictatorship, and if you don't believe that' What's been going on for 8 years? Take a good look around!

20 | Ro Spez | 3 | 10154751584941336_528748080657508 | Well, if this country doesn't see justice, I hate to see what will happen. Comey better not think he's going to cover up the 2nd time! We all know this should have all come out a long time ago! The fact that she lied and destroyed all those emails is enough to prosecute , and America knows! Stop treating us like we're  ignorant fools! We know the truth and Comey better do what's right or he will lose all respect!
21 | Jon Fryett | 3 | 10154751584941336_10154751835526336 | Some of the Dem wackos are saying Comey, Trump, and Russia are rigging the election. When the tables turn on the Dems, they go into ultra-Lying mode. Hurry....they need a Trump distraction to pull it off.  What can they make up next....the Dems/Clinton campaign?
22 | Carmen Graham Rice | 2 | 10154751584941336_10154751853301336 | Will she become the first USA Dictator? After the election, if she wins, she can be either pardoned by Obama or by her self. Then she can do what ever she desires without true consequence, because she can pardon herself. What will this country become??? If you read the laws and IF she WINS, it's truly terrifying!
23 | Alex Arguelles | 4 | 10154751584941336_10154751808581336 | A LIE Named Hillary I don‚Äôt detest Hillary Clinton because she is a woman. I oppose her because she cannot tell the truth to save her life. Any public servant who has the gall to issue a list of terms the press cannot utter, as if disposing the corpse of free will, is helplessly deluded and a petulant child. Sorry, Hillary, but no one owes you anything; especially the nation you proclaim to serve with nothing but the benevolence of blind ambition. If your candidacy cannot survive without the aid of deception, division, and the fabricated catcalls of ‚Äúsexism‚Äù to demonize your critics, then please tell us why America needs you? Better yet, please explain how you‚Äôre even worthy of a job? A leader doesn‚Äôt need pollsters, a panel of advisors, two news conferences and a room full of media drones just to announce whether or not she used an unauthorized server to conduct official government business and therefore deleted emails in an attempt to avoid prosecution. A leader would never break the law in the first place. And a leader doesn‚Äôt shout ‚Äúwhat does it matter‚Äù when four lives are lost in the wake of her unmitigated failure. Any self-respecting adult with an ounce of integrity would simply admit the truth. Excuse me, any self-aware child who knows the difference between right and wrong, life and death.If I‚Äôm hiring someone to run my business, placing my future in foreign hands, I don‚Äôt care whether you‚Äôre a Democrat or Republican, a man or woman, white or black. I want the most qualified candidate whose character speaks for itself and whose ideals can stand on the merits of their own wisdom. That‚Äôs common sense. Are you going to have the audacity to tell me what I can and can‚Äôt ask; what verbiage is acceptable? If your resume and vision are truly best for the entire nation, not just one party, gender or race, either should be able to withstand the most blistering questions and exhaustive scrutiny. In fact, you should welcome any and all discourse to discredit your detractors and display your competence. A leader unites, empowers and inspires by example, not by excuses or endless blame. Tell me the national debt is a record 18 trillion and that Barack Obama has raised it more than the first 42 presidents combined. Admit that 93 million Americans are out of the workforce, nearly 50 million are on public assistance, and that the economic recovery is a sham. Admonish Iran as a destabilizing force of Islamic radicalism that must never be mentioned in the same sentence as ‚Äúnuclear power". Recognize the reality every civilized nation has immigration laws and that American sovereignty, the safety and security of her people, supersedes any political ploy to stuff the ballot box beneath the hollow cries of racism.Yes, just like generations of legal immigrants before your candidacy, respect is given when trust is earned. If you are incapable of acknowledging simple, documented facts - solely because it‚Äôs easier to hide behind a propaganda platform that cajoles and incites an expendable public - you‚Äôre not interested in solving anything, let alone serving the American people or any notion of truth. You‚Äôre the cancer killing the country I love. You‚Äôre the lie my forefathers never told. PLEASE SHARE LET'S TAKE CONTROL!
24 | Gail Joy Abbott | 3 | 10154751584941336_528747693990880 | I'm thinking Hillary was using Huma's laptop as a back up for all the emails she bleached and deleted from her own computer and server. Who would have thought to look at her top aides computer for 650,000 deleted emails?? Just a thought!
25 | Jeffrey Davey | 1 | 10154751584941336_10154751820821336 | And your report is not biased at all him I think you're a Republican and all you get a report on is what you believe is to be right and best for Donald Trump so maybe I'll get a real life and read some of the reports in the actual news stuff from when Donald Trump has screwed everybody that had anything to do with it he's got his self at the news and at the law of this country get over yourself you don't know crap

This was months after I left the TRUMP organization for family issues.No more then one hour later I was receiving calls from Trump Tower stating that Mr. Trump was very proud to see me lending a hand to help our people and that they would like me to come back to work in the TRUMP organization.This is personal for me, and as a 100% disabled veteran fighting medical bills that the VA refuses to pay I know I need a man like Mr. Trump to stick up for people like me and for the rest of our great nation.God Bless Mr. Trump and God Bless America!‚Äù

However, today's democratic party is something I don't even recognize.  I knew there was corruption in government, but the Clintons are like the mac daddies of corruption. Once you've seen it, you can't UNsee it. Not sure I'm a republican now, or if I'm just a deplorable. Either way, welcome aboard, and go Trump!

Just torques me that the talking heads still call her secretary clinton! Argggg!

Yes, I would love to see more businessmen go into politics because I believe they would bring in an entirely different mindset and strategies than what we‚Äôre used to seeing traditionally,‚Äù she opined. And then she just had to go on. ‚ÄúIn fact, when you say businessmen and women, I can‚Äôt help but think of a particular one that I would just love to see running for the presidency at some point in the future,‚Äù Clinton added. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what it is exactly about him, I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it, but my instinct is almost never wrong.

Donald J. Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the recent Wikileaks revelations and investigation into Hillary Clinton show she "puts herself and her own personal interests before your own."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Daryl Proenza | 420 | 10154751554221336_10154751605451336 | Remember when Trump was laughed at for saying Hillary had the questions ahead of time? Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.#MAGA
2 | Barbara Brown | 58 | 10154751554221336_10154751613876336 | President Donald Trump, he will be the president of the people, for the people and by the people one nation under God.He got my vote.If you haven't voted yet, tomorrow would be a good day.Vote for Trump and Pence.
3 | Wayne R Johnson | 50 | 10154751554221336_10154751605971336 | Hillary's political record is built from greed, stained with blood and covered with a whitewash of lies and conveniently fake excuses of stupidity whenever; the lies begin to weaken in a rain of truth. (Apparently found in Wiener'a laptop)

5 | Ryan Galati | 21 | 10154751554221336_10154751612546336 | Hillary and the rest of the Democrats will continue to deny everything. Back in July James Comey was a hero for the Democrats, now that he is reopening the investigation he is bias they say. They make fun of Trump for saying it's rigged and then THEY SAY THE SAY THING. The FBI is doing a wonderful thing hats off to them.

I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs either connected to her fall or simply the fact that she rarely bathes.‚Äù‚ÄúOutside of encouraging her to take a shower once in a while, I don‚Äôt know what to do about this. ‚Äî any suggestions would be appreciated.‚ÄùRead more: https://ihavethetruth.com/2016/10/31/john-podesta-hillary-is-acting-like-a-retard-she-smells-like-boiled-cabbage-urine-and-farts/#ixzz4OiPcbb

I hold Mr Trump in the highest regard.On 9/13/2001 I was walking out of the pile of concrete, steel, glass, and human debris that was Ground Zero as Mr. Trump was walking in. I think he was with Kevin or Brian (bodyguards), not sure which, but I addressed Mr. Trump and gave him a few breathing masks, then exited the site.

14 | Robert Grove | 1 | 10154751554221336_10154751743331336 | See... here's the funny thing. Illegally obtained evidence cannot be used in a legal prosecution for a crime. So if the cops find your smoking gun as the result of an illegal search, it may prove that you committed a murder, but they can't use it in court. However, that proof will still convict you in the court of public opinion. Everyone will know you're a murderer, even if you got away with it. So it's entirely possible that nothing in the wikileaks releases can be used to prosecute Hillary Clinton in court. But they still exist, and no matter how they try to deflect the blame or distract the public, the fact remains that these e-mails exist, and the people in question did write them. Not enough to convict in a legal court. But then, and election is the ultimate court of public opinion, isn't it?

17 | Alec Gormley | 8 | 10154751554221336_10154751621456336 | Why Weiner would have her emails is the reason there is concern, why anyone would have her emails is beyond policy. Some may think it is trivial but then people do prison time for less and we all know it.

20 | Alex Arguelles | 0 | 10154751554221336_10154751795826336 | A LIE Named Hillary I don‚Äôt detest Hillary Clinton because she is a woman. I oppose her because she cannot tell the truth to save her life. Any public servant who has the gall to issue a list of terms the press cannot utter, as if disposing the corpse of free will, is helplessly deluded and a petulant child. Sorry, Hillary, but no one owes you anything; especially the nation you proclaim to serve with nothing but the benevolence of blind ambition. If your candidacy cannot survive without the aid of deception, division, and the fabricated catcalls of ‚Äúsexism‚Äù to demonize your critics, then please tell us why America needs you? Better yet, please explain how you‚Äôre even worthy of a job? A leader doesn‚Äôt need pollsters, a panel of advisors, two news conferences and a room full of media drones just to announce whether or not she used an unauthorized server to conduct official government business and therefore deleted emails in an attempt to avoid prosecution. A leader would never break the law in the first place. And a leader doesn‚Äôt shout ‚Äúwhat does it matter‚Äù when four lives are lost in the wake of her unmitigated failure. Any self-respecting adult with an ounce of integrity would simply admit the truth. Excuse me, any self-aware child who knows the difference between right and wrong, life and death.If I‚Äôm hiring someone to run my business, placing my future in foreign hands, I don‚Äôt care whether you‚Äôre a Democrat or Republican, a man or woman, white or black. I want the most qualified candidate whose character speaks for itself and whose ideals can stand on the merits of their own wisdom. That‚Äôs common sense. Are you going to have the audacity to tell me what I can and can‚Äôt ask; what verbiage is acceptable? If your resume and vision are truly best for the entire nation, not just one party, gender or race, either should be able to withstand the most blistering questions and exhaustive scrutiny. In fact, you should welcome any and all discourse to discredit your detractors and display your competence. A leader unites, empowers and inspires by example, not by excuses or endless blame. Tell me the national debt is a record 18 trillion and that Barack Obama has raised it more than the first 42 presidents combined. Admit that 93 million Americans are out of the workforce, nearly 50 million are on public assistance, and that the economic recovery is a sham. Admonish Iran as a destabilizing force of Islamic radicalism that must never be mentioned in the same sentence as ‚Äúnuclear power". Recognize the reality every civilized nation has immigration laws and that American sovereignty, the safety and security of her people, supersedes any political ploy to stuff the ballot box beneath the hollow cries of racism.Yes, just like generations of legal immigrants before your candidacy, respect is given when trust is earned. If you are incapable of acknowledging simple, documented facts - solely because it‚Äôs easier to hide behind a propaganda platform that cajoles and incites an expendable public - you‚Äôre not interested in solving anything, let alone serving the American people or any notion of truth. You‚Äôre the cancer killing the country I love. You‚Äôre the lie my forefathers never told. PLEASE SHARE LET'S TAKE CONTROL!

Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:‚Äú(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.‚ÄùYes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that?

24 | Steph Corbin | 2 | 10154751554221336_10154751623986336 | has anyone read a tom Clancy novel where Jack Ryan is always the american hero who defeats the enemy?has anyone read a tom Clancy novel where Jack Ryan is always the american hero who defeats the enemy?tom Clancy couldn't even write a novel where you would have to suspend disbelief enough to get through a book that narrates this presidential election. you literally have the antagonist who is Hillary, who has a lieutenant Hum Abadine is working for the Muslim brotherhood, (her mother is a member) and the Protagonist who is Trump (the american businessman)who is trying to defeat the corruption, but a rambunctious character. Then, on top of your novel you have a character named Wiener who sends wiener pics. Then you have the FBI who covered up for the antagonist then in toward end of this fictional novel does the right thing and stands up for the protagonist and the american people by doing the right thing and exposing the enemy (Clinton) and her international scams and her bribes and lies, but so far in the story then we don't have an ending for it yet because we don't have a winner yet in the election. This is straight out of a Tom Clancy novel.

"There will always be a debate on when people believe life starts. Some people will never see eye to eye. But my message is not to argue that point. It is to spread the word that fighting through difficult pregnancies is worth it!"

1 | Katie Hamby | 480 | 10154750270996336_10154751507011336 | I believe we need a candidate that supports life, and Donald trump is that candidate. Hillary Clinton is the opposite of someone who supports life. How can you support partial birth abortions?
2 | Toni Shutt | 327 | 10154750270996336_10154751519046336 | I can never understand why it's not murder for an abortion but it's considered a double homicide if the mom is killed while still carrying the baby. There is no logical sense to that. A baby is not created from two dead things. Life begins at conception. Plus, if my son's biological mom would have aborted him, I would never have a child.
3 | Teresa Spitzer Ray | 227 | 10154750270996336_10154751520006336 | I met a women not long ago who was told that her baby would only have a 2% chance of living after birth,. Her doctors advised her to get an abortion, right up until her 9th month.  Her baby was perfectly healthy and is now 2 1/2 years old.  She chose life, and has a precious little girl.
4 | Zach Kitzmiller | 126 | 10154750270996336_10154751518776336 | My thing is - just don't use government funding to do it. I pay taxes and I don't want those taxes paying for someone's abortion. Their food? Sure. Their shelter? Sure. Their murder (regardless if you disagree or not that it's murder)? NO WAY!
5 | Daryl Proenza | 158 | 10154750270996336_10154751506231336 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...
6 | Tina Hoeft | 115 | 10154750270996336_10154751519226336 | My cousin was given a 0% chance her baby would be born, if she was, she would of been stillborn! She how has a healthy 4 yr. old daughter! Not a darn thing wrong with her! She was told this by 2 different Dr's! Just proves they don't know everything! They are NOT God!
7 | Mary Sprinkle | 59 | 10154750270996336_10154751521711336 | This is not a unique situation. I have heard stories from multiple women who have been encouraged to get abortions because of either potential health risks for themselves or even genetic defects in the baby. And then nothing happens! Mother and baby are fine in SO MANY cases.
8 | Kathy Lamb | 39 | 10154750270996336_10154751532381336 | I was told that there was less than a 20% chance that me and the baby would make it. My Dr was a family friend and advised me to terminate. My daughter is perfectly healthy and eleven years old. It wasn't always easy, but oh my God was it worth it ‚ù§
9 | Hamidreza Azarmehr | 64 | 10154750270996336_10154751507991336 | Hillary Clinton once said someone who was under FBI investigation shouldn't have been allowed to buy a gun. That's very true!!! Now someone who is also back under FBI investigation should not be allowed to run for President of the United States either.   Hillary Clinton should drop out of the Presidential race immediately.
10 | Alec Gormley | 13 | 10154750270996336_10154751518766336 | We live in a one shoe fits all society, I believe if we just give it a chance it will be ok even if it is different. People helping people with the same needs is what it is about, abortion is a cop out.
11 | De Leah Owens Kohl | 9 | 10154750270996336_10154751571386336 | I am reading all these really great stories about women being advised to abort and yet they didn't. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but ultimately wasn't it  these individual women's choice. I am not by any means saying I agree with abortion. But I am saying it's a woman's right to choose what goes on with her own body. Her choice, and what ever that choice is, she will have to live with. It is not up to me to judge her. What if there were a law, that stated if a Dr thinks a woman will have an abnormal baby, they demand that it's aborted? And if you didn't you would be breaking the law. How would people feel then? Don't judge unless you can walk in their shoes, and unless you are up for sainthood.
12 | Bill Schaffer | 15 | 10154750270996336_10154751549591336 | If a pregnant womans' urine test indicates cocaine use,she can be arrested for distributing drugs to a minor.If a pregnant woman who takes an illegal drug she can be prosecuted for delivering a controlled substance to a minor.This is an explicit recognition that the unborn IS A PERSON with rights deserving protection even from his/her mother.However, that same woman who's prosecuted and jailed for endangering her child is free to abort that same child.In America today it's illegal to harm your preborn child,but it's perfectly legal to kill him.If alchohol harms unborn babies, what does abortion do to them?In 2004 Congress passed the "Unborn Victims of Violence Act" which states that someone who intentionally kills or attemptsto kill the unborn child be punished for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being. Consider the bizarre implications of the double standard if a woman is scheduled to get an abortion but on the way to the abortion clinic her baby is killed in-utero,the babies killer will be prosecuted for murder,but if this murder dosen't occur,an hour later the doctor will be paid to preform a legal procedure killing exactly the same child(in a way that is probably more gruesome)To the child what's the difference who kills her?Human beings shouldn't be discriminated against because of their place of residence.There's nothing about birth that makes a baby essentially different than he was before birth.There's no magic that changes a childs nature when she moves 20 inches from inside her mother to outside.Many states have passed homicide laws declaring it murder for anyone but the mother to deliberately take the life of a preborn child.These laws are the explicit affirmations that the child is a human being.Personhood has an inherent value that comes from being a member of the human race.According to The Bible this is part of being created in God's image.But who determines which lives are meaningful and which aren't.The answer always is that powerful people decide whether weaker peoples' lives are meaningful.We have a brief opportunity-a lifetime on earth-to use our resources to make a difference for eternity.
13 | Vanessa Elizabeth DiVittorio | 5 | 10154750270996336_10154751602451336 | Ok but are you also going to report on the woman who gave birth when the doctors said she could abort and both her and the child died in the process?That is not your choice to make.
14 | Angie Phifer | 7 | 10154750270996336_10154751583686336 | Happy for this Mom who chose to have this baby. It sickens me to know HRC wants to abort full term babies and called mentally ill children "Fu-king Retards". She will pay for that and Satan is waiting standing at the gates of Hell to greet her.
15 | Courtney Smith | 14 | 10154750270996336_10154751540531336 | You see story after story like this where doctors tell a couple that their child is incompatible with life and time after time they are WRONG! Doctors are great, but they're not God. No reason to ever kill a child.
16 | Gabe Brunner | 27 | 10154750270996336_10154751509621336 | There is no debate to rational people. Life starts at conception, period.
17 | Samantha Traver | 10 | 10154750270996336_10154751577651336 | AMEN! My 24 week Miracle is now almost 4! He was 1lb 11oz! Was told to terminate. But I didn't! I had him 1 day later!ONE DAY! Let that stink in.I had him one day after a doctor told me to kill him because he wouldn't make it... he's now almost 4, and perfect!
18 | Dana Birdwell Shofner | 10 | 10154750270996336_10154751578711336 | I know so many parents who want to adopt. Why don't we use our taxes to support adoption services instead of planned parenthood?! I'm appalled at the evil our country is supporting :(
19 | Mary Miedel Seibel | 5 | 10154750270996336_10154751545981336 | Breaks me heart to think of all these kinds of could have beens. I personally know 2 people who were told to abort because of problems and they BOTH have beautiful, healthy children...not our decison to make to end a life üíìüíìüíì
20 | Carole A. Brewer | 8 | 10154750270996336_10154751515671336 | just read this article on someone else's newsfeed. It's a real eye opener to say the least!Let me explain a few things to people who don't understand how this will end. People call these Muslims refugees! BS... this is an army invading our country under the assumption they are refugees. This is the only way to invade America from the inside and people say why we are strong and yes America is a super power. Killary wants to bring in 500,000 more how many are already here?. People say they are nice people I live with them and work with them, that is a red herring. Once they have enough and that will be soon if Killary is elected president. And listen to this very closely because it's no joke. Once they have the numbers here it will begin, and remember Obumer is closing Guantanamo Bay and bringing the worst of the worst Muslim leaders here to America. Why would you say does it matter well I'm going to tell you. Once the numbers are here and your "Social Security is funding all this " then they will detonate EMP bombs around America where it will do the most damage to the grid. Now some people ask what is a EMP bomb. It will destroy anything that is electrical, ie cars ,planes, generators,cell phones you get my point now. How will that be bad people ask, so I will explain . America will return to the dark ages no power to stay warm or cook no ac to stay cool no way to ship food no way to keep meat good. No place to buy food no way to call for help so people ask why would I need to call for help. Well that's when these so called refugees will turn into an Army that will start the take over of America. They will go from town to towns state to state and they will kill you cut your head's off they will rape and pillage everything and everyone they have contact with. Christians will be killed without mercy. I'll fight you say I'll call the cops or the army someone. No you won't no way to call for help phones won't work and Killary has already taken our guns so your fight won't last long. ie. Don't bring a gun to a knife fight. But don't worry Killary will set up FEMA camps for your protection she will say but many will be killed in these camps. How will you feed your family with no food no stores no walmart. So many Americans will die from starvation in the first month alone it will be sick. And then you have people in your own town that will try to take what you have to feed their's. Race groups killing and pillaging anywhere they want. America will be lost forever meanwhile all those countries that hate America will attack because we will be like sitting ducks in a pond. So prepare the best you can because this is what you are voting for if you vote this traitor as president. Some of you idiot's will laugh but I assure you when it happens it will be no laughing matter when your young girls are raped in front of you and watch as your sons and husband's heads are cut off. And no one will be able to help you you won't be able to fight because Killary took our right as American citizens all so she can fill her pockets. Obumer is Muslim plant that has brainwashed Killary into destroying the country she says she loves. Trump is our only way out of this out come so be smart people think for yourselfs and let's make America the great country it was before this traitor took control. You need to ask yourselfs why would any United States president give 400 million dollars to country like Iran that is the biggest funder of terrorist Go Trump/Pence Drain those swamps
21 | Robyn Young | 5 | 10154750270996336_10154751587281336 | I was born out of a rape and my parents loved me and I had no close till I was in my 30s. I also had my appendix rupture and they told me to abort and i wouldn't  sign the papers. That child is 26 years old and a marine and I have been so blessed. For myself no option because of who I am, for others it is their choice but just don't use my tax dollars and use abortion as. Birth control. I've seen that and I can't imagine. And counsel people who are getting it so they know what happens so they know ALL the facts. So many women have guilt and more down the road.
22 | Jon McClure | 26 | 10154750270996336_10154751515196336 | Death is when the heart ceases to beat. Life is when it begins. I was once Pro-Choice and realized it isn't about choice or a woman's body. It is about a human life and progressives pushing eugenics upon this nation.
23 | Ashley Pireaux Stairs | 4 | 10154750270996336_10154751561081336 | Over 8 months into my 2nd pregnancy, I had an ultrasound, and a subsequent MRI that confirmed my son had a congenital neurological brain abnormality. The remainder of that pregnancy was high risk, and about 10 minutes after that confirmatory MRI we were handed (without prompting) a list of States in the U.S. that did late term abortions. Fast forward 7 years, we have a healthy and smart little boy. The diagnosis was correct, however what we were to expect, was not. In that moment of absolute weakness, we held our sons life in our hands. The genetic Counselors were not supportive.
24 | Diane Day | 1 | 10154750270996336_10154751556996336 | God gives us trials to make us stronger. How we chose to fight those trials is the risks we take. I myself would never give up just like you. Babies are all blessings & should not be thrown away. This child is beautiful & is cherished,
25 | Joanna Mcnabb Newman | 0 | 10154750270996336_10154751720131336 | Good for you mom. Your little one is adorable! My son had cancer. Different situation, but still it was my child's life on the line. We didn't get the happy ending we wanted- yet. But we did do everything we knew how, and we gave it the best fight we could until he went to heaven. Sure know what it's like to suffer PTSD. But like you said, we did everything we could. I'm glad we did. It's hard enough to deal with that kind of a loss, but to have guilt as well, that would have been unbearable. Blessings to you and yours! Enjoy that little one. Such a precious gift.

EXCLUSIVE: Billionaire Sheldon Adelson just committed $25 million to an anti-Hillary Clinton Super PAC to try and help tilt the presidential race and down ballot House and Senate races to Republicans, Fox News learned Monday.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Chad Wynn | 3753 | 10154751259951336_10154751371116336 | Remember when Obama said his administration would be the most transparent in history? Well thanks to Wikileaks's now they are, and now they're all pissed about it, liberal hypocrisy at its finest
2 | Hamidreza Azarmehr | 4409 | 10154751259951336_10154751371421336 | Remember when Trump was laughed at for saying Hillary had the questions ahead of time? Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.
3 | Justin Roberts | 1361 | 10154751259951336_10154751371916336 | When will Bernie Sanders hold a press conference rescending his endorsement of Clinton in light of the newest wikileaks involving Donna Brazille, oh that's right.. the socialist is enjoying his $600K lakefront property paid for by Clinton Inc.
4 | Brian Isgrigg | 419 | 10154751259951336_10154751374516336 | We are going to win so much, we are going to have win after win after win! And you people are going to get sick and tired of winning, you people are going to say " Please please President Trump we can't take this much victory, please stop we don't want any more wins". And I'm going to say to you, "We are going to win, I don't care what you say, we are going to make our country great again! We're going to win! We're going to win! And we're going to win!
5 | Kristen Stromberger | 312 | 10154751259951336_10154751381016336 | Funny how the tables are turning against her. I hope that flight log gets published along with the dirty details of the Weiner emails. This country needs to see what it's trying to elect!
6 | Lisa Ledford | 345 | 10154751259951336_10154751372456336 | I don't understand why no one has brought up that fact that OBAMA  used a pseudonym - his hands are dirty too - why would he do that unless he knew she was breaking the law with unsecure illegal servers- they need to do search on what he said in the infamous emails
7 | James Branigan | 240 | 10154751259951336_10154751388821336 | I for one applaud Adelson's decision to support not only Trump but republican running for reelection in the house & senate.  Trump needs a majority in both houses, in the first 4 years, to really make all his plans for reform in this country happen.  Go Trump.
8 | Daryl Proenza | 283 | 10154751259951336_10154751381526336 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...
9 | Jessica Brooks Hatcher | 229 | 10154751259951336_10154751382511336 | Why not? Obama's campaigning for Hillary on the taxpayer dime. Atleast Adelson's contribution isn't costing the middle class taxpayer. Woohoo!
10 | Mike Brown | 60 | 10154751259951336_10154751416291336 | Past time for ALL Republican career politicians who trashed Trump to jump on board. The train is leaving without you and be darn certain we the people will remember you when you're up for re-election
11 | Kenneth Banning | 47 | 10154751259951336_10154751409251336 | The people that make me feel guilty for voting for Trump can go screw themselves. Hillary's had over thirty years to get things right and still hasn't. Obama has damaged people with his Obama care and more on the way. He wants to take care of refugees while our own suffer. Democrats have screwed up enough and republicans , it was supposed to be We the PEOPLE. It's gotten where both parties are lining their own pockets and to hell with the people. Disgusting.
12 | Todd Baker | 41 | 10154751259951336_10154751402326336 | This isn't my original post......I just copied it. To spread the word. There is a guy on Twitter who is posting some incredible stuff, mindboggling really. If it's true, it'll bring down the entire Obama administration, if not the entire government. Here goes:Hector Morenco-Soon the world will discover HRC & Obama are at the center of the Syrian conflict, profited from the Clinton foundation, & ignored ISIS.Quatar & Saudis donated to the Clinton foundation while HRC was Sec. State. In exchange for the donations, the CIA was sent to Syria (2011).CIA was behind a staged Arab spring uprising to attempt to topple Assad, because he was blocking the Quatar/Turkey pipeline plan.ISIS formed by accident, and spiraled out of control but also provided cover for the Obama/HRC agenda of laudering bribes for the pipeline.Emails on HRC's private server confirm these tragic events, and Obama & HRC thought they could pardon each other after the election.Little did Obama/HRC realize that an auto-sync feature between Huma & Weiner inadvertently saved the deleted emails on Weiner's machine.Trump in many ways is a sideshow to the brazen criminality & size & scope of the Obama admin & Clinton's corruption enterprise.Russia also cut a deal with Assad to allow an alternative Iran pipeline to go through Syria in exchange for favorable OPEC votes & cash.The cash payments from Iran were actually wealth transfers from Obama>>Iran>>Russia. Obama got pissed that the Iranian money went to Russia.The Democrats were so irritated for being played by the Iranians and Russians that they now want to reignite the cold war against Russia.These bombshells will be confirmed by Wikileaks/Dikileaks soon, but maybe not before the election. The volume of hacked material is massive.If HRC wins then Obama & the Clinton's will pull off the largest heist in the history of the world. That's how important this election is.This high level heist leaving millions dead is also why HRC wants to assassinate Assange & why Obama sent Kerry to Ecuador. Now it's too late.The larger story is how many insiders fighting for a take there are. All of the MSM is getting a piece of the action from Obama/HRC.When Trump talks about "Draining the Swamp" he is right, & has risked his life going against the entire world's corrupt power structure.Please promote this message. I'm working to release source but running out of time. Already spent 300+ hours & won't finish before election.
13 | Brandon Avolin | 26 | 10154751259951336_10154751409851336 | As it would be nice to have HRC indicted on my birthday, I am predicting on Nov 5th 2016, HRC and her entire squad will be indicted on numerous Federal Felonies and Treasonous Acts against the American People and humanity as a whole. She will be also charged with "RICO" and her entire empire will come crashing down! Any bets?
14 | Jon Roorda | 22 | 10154751259951336_10154751399401336 | While I'm happy this went to Anti Hillary I'm still saddened by the fact that this is what our political system has become, a money laundering mechanism to acquire power and influence
15 | Nona Ziva Nakhamiass | 12 | 10154751259951336_10154751408981336 | I've important attachment to sent to any of top peoples, like Mr. Shown, Ms. Magyn Kelly or the judge. I do not have any of any of you email to sent the attachment. Clearly showing Huma Abedin, and Hillary Clinton works together were involved in 9/11. Peopless are blind voting for her. Exact words of Obama in 2008 at CNN his own words "Don't trust Hillary Clinton"
16 | Mario Point | 30 | 10154751259951336_10154751403781336 | Thank you Sheldon!!! We are going to make America Great again. Can't wait until the big polls come out Thursday and shows Trump with a landslide lead. A lot of early voters want to change their vote to Trump.
17 | April Longhurst | 22 | 10154751259951336_10154751386551336 | Trump has spent significantly less then Hillary and he's winning. So tell me how the hell does dumping money at it make a difference unless you're buying votes
18 | Joel M. Mazel | 55 | 10154751259951336_10154751372941336 | Get out the vote for Trump now until the polls close on Election Day. Let's win by a landslide on Nov. 8. Enough of the corruption, deception, and lies!!
19 | Cristina Walke | 21 | 10154751259951336_10154751420976336 | Trump has been 100% accurate this whole time. He has stated everything that keeps proving Hillary is dangerous for our nation. She also doesn't apologize for any of her actions with the emails. Makes me SO furious.
20 | Tammy Crabtree | 37 | 10154751259951336_10154751381191336 | White water, travel gate, email gate, pay for play wikileaks proof, cheat and got CNN reporter fired, hired people to cause fights at Trump rally's, fined while serving as first lady for perjury. The lists of Hillary's  scandals while serving " we the people  go on and on.
21 | Debbie Miracle | 35 | 10154751259951336_10154751414026336 | Trump we likeTry this. I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump. The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want. Trump has so much love in his heart for our country, and the democrats are for themselves only. Look at all he has done to help people and that means so much to me and should mean a lot to everyone. He has a heart and the democrats don't. We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."Like ¬∑ Reply ¬∑ 36 ¬∑ 1 hr

The guy that has repeatedly declared bankruptcy & not paid taxes, or contractors. That's the guy you want running our country? Seriously?
25 | Steve Krauss | 8 | 10154751259951336_680223042154525 | The reaction by Hillary condemning Comey tells you she is worried. It makes Comey's job easier now as he already has more than enough espionage, racketeering and perjury charges to indict. The patriotic Super PACs and other good Americans are going to help inform the low information voters. Trump is going to help us restore America.

Press Secretary Josh Earnest says President Obama's assessment of FBI Director Comey's integrity and character has not changed.

1 | Jimmy Christianson | 598 | 10154750603721336_10154751225441336 | Remember when Obama said his administration would be the most transparent in history? Well thanks to Wikileaks's now they are, and now they're all pissed about it, liberal hypocrisy at its finest
2 | Eric Mann | 573 | 10154750603721336_10154751210146336 | We must remove the Democratic establishment and elect Trump. After that, we can deal with the traitors in the Republican party.
3 | Marcus Henderson | 206 | 10154750603721336_10154751213971336 | I remember when Obama said Hillary was unfit for office. Boy he wasn't lying about that was he.lol Americans are fed up with the corruption!!
4 | Mark Amo | 105 | 10154750603721336_10154751244536336 | This is the first time Obama didn't prejudge something. The Beer Summit, Trayvon Martin, Ferguson, MO... the list goes on and you have to wonder what his motivation is this time
5 | Timothy E J Eusini | 94 | 10154750603721336_10154751231486336 | Obama separating from Hillary by way of this statement about Comey, because he's almost an accomplice at this point and needs to separate before the Clinton ship is sunk and he hisself is totally implicated.
6 | Billy Perry | 82 | 10154750603721336_10154751213546336 | The dems are falling apart. All worried about their own selfish legacy turning on each other.
7 | Chad Wynn | 66 | 10154750603721336_10154751210706336 | Just curious.. What happens if Hillary is elected, then is indicted before her or Kaine have been inaugurated, and becomes ineligible to become president...I don't think Kaine would become president because he would never have been inaugurated (not sure). Who would then become president? Barrack Hussein Obama? Could this have been planned all along?
8 | Tammy Benson | 63 | 10154750603721336_10154751222186336 | TRUMP WAS RIGHT AGAIN!!! CORRUPTION! RIGGING OF DEBATES!! CRIMINALS! I'm so sick that people are still supporting this walking embarrassment! She should be in jail! no FEDERAL PRISON!! won't happen because obama knows the blowback will cover him also so he's blocking all attempts to prosecute her!!
9 | Jackie Pettitt | 44 | 10154750603721336_10154751251321336 | This speaks volumes. This is to protect Obama and nothing more. It's a fake investigation. Comey will stall and then come up with some BS conclusion and that will be it. This is the most corrupt administration in a History.
10 | Pete Iatrou | 12 | 10154750603721336_10154751217416336 | Wow! Only in Washington is the reasoning that if hundreds of people of questionable character and ethics attest to your character, then your character somehow is strong.
11 | Lauren Pyzikiewicz | 12 | 10154750603721336_10154751315116336 | If you're old enough to have been a witness to all the corruption the Clintons are involved in and surrounded by - and you  STILL choose to vote for them......well then that's just a special kind of  oblivious ignorant!
12 | Krista Battey | 27 | 10154750603721336_10154751291016336 | If someone you know is constantly getting into trouble with the police. Constantly being investigated. Has been caught lying over and over, yet every time they're in trouble they claim they are innocent?? Is that someone to entrust with your valuables? Someone you want to run the country? At some point, you have to stop listening to what they are saying and look at what they have been doing to get the truth. If trouble always follows someone.... chances are.....it's them. Let's leave the past behind us. Start a new direction. Vote for Donald Trump!
13 | Ed Fluegeman | 17 | 10154750603721336_10154751260561336 | I don't need the Whitehouse to tell me who possesses integrity. I can do that all by myself. Besides, look who they endorsed for the presidency. A woman who is completely void of integrity.
14 | Prudence Halbeisen | 12 | 10154750603721336_10154751277906336 | Comey had a moral and legal obligation to inform congress and We the People of the new development. To have waited until later on would been an injustice to the American people and our right to know and be informed.. So if it changes people's voting stance so be it.. Corruption has no place in our  judicial or our American system.. Those who believe it does and practices this type of rhetoric need to be out the door.. and charged for whatever part they have played in it.. be it republican or democrat.

The Sopranos without the class or the charm.Weiner and Lady Weiner, perusing the long list of Clinton helpers cast into flames, no doubt are reviewing witness protection programs.

19 | Bret Miller | 7 | 10154750603721336_10154751265806336 | When potus has spoken in the past he lied so why would we as America believe his lying ASSessment on any thing  or anybody now! So Mr. Earnest please hush!
20 | Rich Minser | 3 | 10154750603721336_10154751252336336 | At least President Obama still respects the guy for doing his job. Just wait until we see what the FBI has. It's going to look like Tammany Hall on steroids.
21 | Michael Condee | 10 | 10154750603721336_10154751224881336 | CRITICAL LIFE LESSON ."Do you know how to catch wild pigs?".There was a chemistry professor in a large college that had some exchange students in the class. One day while the class was in the lab, the professor noticed one young man, an exchange student, who kept rubbing his back and stretching as if his back hurt.The professor asked the young man what was the matter. The student told him he had a bullet lodged in his back. He had been shot while fighting communists in his native country who were trying to overthrow his country's government and install a new communist regime. In the midst of his story, he looked at the professor and asked a strange question. He asked: "Do you know how to catch wild pigs?"The professor thought it was a joke and asked for the punch line. The young man said that it was no joke. "You catch wild pigs by finding a suitable place in the woods and putting corn on the ground. The pigs find it and begin to come every day to eat the free food"."When they are used to coming every day, you put a fence down one side of the place where they are used to coming. When they get used to the fence, they begin to eat the corn again and you put up another side of the fence". "They get used to that and start to eat again.You continue until you have all four sides of the fence up with a gate in the last side". "The pigs, which are used to the free corn, start to come through the gate to eat that free corn again. You then slam the gate on them and catch the whole herd"."Suddenly the wild pigs have lost their freedom. They run around and around inside the fence, but they are caught. Soon they go back to eating the free corn. They are so used to it that they have forgotten how to forage in the woods for themselves, so they accept their captivity."The young man then told the professor that is exactly what he sees happening in America . The government keeps pushing us toward Communism/Socialism and keeps spreading the free corn out in the form of programs such as supplemental income, tax credit for unearned income, tax exemptions, tobacco subsidies, dairy subsidies, payments not to plant crops (CRP), welfare entitlements, medicine, drugs, etc., while we continually lose our freedoms, just a little at a time as the government forces us to participate in many of these programs whether or not we want to.One should always remember two truths: There is no such thing as a free lunch, and you can never hire someone to provide a service for you cheaper than you can do it yourself. If you see that all of this wonderful government "help" is a problem confronting the future of democracy in America, you might want to share this with your friends.  God help us all when the gate slams shut!Quote for today: "The problems we face today are there because the people who work for a living are now outnumbered by those that vote for a living."
22 | Alec Gormley | 4 | 10154750603721336_10154751322771336 | Obama knew what she was doing so he is keeping his mouth shut so it does not get used against him when they all go down.
23 | Alec Gormley | 3 | 10154750603721336_10154751319591336 | Our national security has been compromised by his Secretary of State BUT says nothing. He must be very sure of himself to be so distant saying nothing about what Hillary is accused of you would think he would be concerned about what she was doing behind his back,
24 | Sandra Kae Swearingen | 0 | 10154750603721336_1795561590657823 | And he is! When you have Obama, Hillary, the attorney general getting in the way of doing Comey's job objectively, thoroughly ...then what we are all witnessing is what you get as a result of interference, along with corruption and the breaking down of the judicial  system.
25 | Paula Gervais | 2 | 10154750603721336_10154751317821336 | And that endorsement should be enough to make the hair on the back of anyone's neck stand straight up..That guy looks like a goodie two shoes one bad ..ughhh..he grins like a cheshire cat..all kinds of shifty..

5 | Billy Felde | 4938 | 10154750054796336_10154751014406336 | What makes Bryan Cranston and these other idiot celebrities think Canada wants them?  Why would Canada want the USA's trash?
6 | Cherie Last Peterson | 2141 | 10154750054796336_10154751010151336 | If only all those who have stated this would really do it, give up their US Citizenship as well, and pay Canadian Taxes on their income!
7 | Sally Cassil | 1906 | 10154750054796336_10154751012071336 | Sadly. not one of the "celebrities" who said they would leave if Bush was re-elected actually did so. This is just another empty gesture.
8 | Kenny Ellerbe | 1546 | 10154750054796336_1585528304806495 | So many people are leaving if Trump gets elected. I'm really excited about that. It's like taking out the trash when you vote!!! Canada will soon know what it feels like to have open borders. I bet they will start building a fence/wall in two years when they see what they're getting. üòÇüòÇ

11 | James Allen | 652 | 10154750054796336_968047099966851 | Dear Hollywood celebrities, and Sports celebrities, Liberal Talk show hosts and "Famous Actors,"You exist for MY entertainment. Some of you are great eye candy. Some of you can deliver a line with such conviction that you bring tears to my eyes. Some of you can scare the crap out of me. Others make me laugh. But you all have one thing in common, you only have a place in MY world to entertain me. That‚Äôs it!You make your living PRETENDING to be someone else. Playing dress up like a 6 year old. You live in a make believe world in front of a camera. And often when you are away from one too. Your entire existence depends on MY patronage.Just keep this one thing in your mind; I‚Äôll crank the organ grinder; you dance. When I want or feel like it, you're MY Monkey; I feed you; you don't feed me.
12 | RJ LaGrange | 713 | 10154750054796336_1585526964806629 | Too funny that the United States is good enough to make millions of dollars but as soon as these crybabies don't like something they want to move. This is exactly what we are trying to fix. No more taking advantage of the United States!
13 | Georgia Thibodeau | 296 | 10154750054796336_1585535424805783 | Why is everyone going to Canada and not Mexico. I'll chip in for the flight. If this keeps up, we'll clean out the liberals. Poor Canada. Maybe Canada won't want them.
14 | Anthony Vono | 303 | 10154750054796336_10154751003921336 | The Republican leaders that have joined the Democrat band wagon who are complaining about Comeys'' recent move to reopen the case against Hillary Clinton are all part of the same Establishment that want Trump to lose. Uncommitted voters and late deciders, don't be bamboozled
15 | Dianne A Troester | 197 | 10154750054796336_1786056854991059 | Yeah that's real patriotic.. everyone who doesn't like the President moves out of country.. Why not remain and try to make things better in YOUR country??  No, just flee cause you can't be bothered fighting for it.
16 | Mark Alan Hays | 187 | 10154750054796336_968048276633400 | Frankly, no one would miss ANY of the "celebrities" who have vowed to leave the U.S. if Trump is elected.  I do wonder, however, if Cranston is like most of the other "celebs" who threaten to leave would go to Canada?  I haven't heard one of these liberal, sheeple fools say they would move to Mexico!  Wouldn't that fact make them racists?!
17 | Kara Reece Smith | 173 | 10154750054796336_10154751010286336 | This country would be better off if EVERY Hollywood star would move to Canada. Period.
18 | Holly Burke Raymond | 103 | 10154750054796336_1226822854026677 | Why do these celebrities think the people care if they move out of the country or not? So you end up with dual citizenship...big deal. Maybe you could denounce all the money you make while working in the music/movie industry in United States, if the winner of the election is that big of a disappointment to you. I could give two shits if you move or anyone else for that matter.
19 | Jennie Parr Stoll | 99 | 10154750054796336_1585546078138051 | Trump--already making America great again. Losing one Hollywood wingnut at a time. If you TRULY loved this country, you'd fight for it, regardless of the outcome of the election. But nope, you'll spout your meaningless drivel, and when Trump is elected, you'll backtrack. And how it was all for show. Because the reality is that Canada doesn't want you either. And nowhere else in the world can you live your elitist lifestyle.
20 | Jeremy Barker | 86 | 10154750054796336_1786057504990994 | U can be easily replaced. Ur contributions to society is limited to none. U won't be missed and never had any skill set America actually needed. I wish u the best in your endeavors

Canada is a great country, not a boobie prize when you don't get your way. I don't like DT, but I am not going back if he wins. I will continue on raising 3 children, being a decent human being and supporting this country, and the people who are running it, as best I can.
22 | Michael Fawley | 54 | 10154750054796336_1255865591122068 | Yet nobody cares and your opinion will motivate no one to change their vote. When will celebrities recognize that they should shut their mouth about politics? You are bound to piss off half the country no matter what side you take and Trump supporters will not forget this. You have just lowered your worth as an actor and we all know you are full of s**t and won't actually leave this great country, best of luck. #Trump16
23 | Margaret Leahey Bailey | 50 | 10154750054796336_10154751009816336 | I can not stand that woman from NPR Radio that you have on Fox...she is so ANTI TRUMP....Brit Hume, the worst person you have on air, has her on all the time, and she is on tonight with Bret. She has NO BRAINS...only negative opinions.
24 | Betty Stanley | 39 | 10154750054796336_968046263300268 | What makes you think Canada wants you and all the others?  I know some they may balk at having them move to their country.  Bryan, go pack because he is going to be the next president.  We do not want a lying, corrupt traitor like Hillary Clinton as our President. if elected she will be impeached when she goes to prison.
25 | Robyn Blosio Bova | 27 | 10154750054796336_1796502507297061 | Would you trust a person who is being accused of molesting children to babysit for you? Would you give the keys to your house to a person who is on trial for robbery? Would you allow someone who is being accused of abusing animals to pet sit for you? Then why would you ever give your vote to someone who HAS left soldiers behind to die, who HAS lied to the FBI, and the people of the United States and has put our country in great danger by putting classified information out for the world to see including our enemies. I just don't get it. :(

3 | Wayne R Johnson | 1725 | 10154750935806336_10154750937166336 | Hillary Clinton conspired with Donna Brazil and by cheating and lying again she proves her dishonesty, lack of integrity, and lack of honor by her willingness to cheat. Since she is incapable of standing for what is right on small issues like debate questions, how can we expect her to stand for American justice as president.Fire Hillary and vote Trump!
4 | Jen Smith | 665 | 10154750935806336_10154750937461336 | You're going down with the ship you created Hillary!! TRUMP 2016!!

Now the cars are made in Mexico and they can drink the water..Definitely moving toward a 3rd world nation from Clinton, Bush and Obama reigns since the 90s..Vote TRUMP. Address and reverse NAFTA, GATT and TTP. USA 1st. Not Globalism on the nickel of the legal US citizens..
6 | Arthur N Denise Ewing | 357 | 10154750935806336_10154750959101336 | ‚ö†If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ VOTE TRUMP!!!

8 | Lex K Morse | 152 | 10154750935806336_10154750946801336 | She is pathetic! She has given our enemies our secrets and our uranium, any far left loon votes for her, move to North Korea!
9 | Santi Serra | 95 | 10154750935806336_705647899590996 | This woman is shameless and really embodies how she thinks she is over the law. Any other candidates would have been pushed off to the side. Hillary Clinton you are despicable, crooked, corrupt, liar and worst ever this country have ever seen who is running for Presidency.
10 | Shayne Sullivan | 98 | 10154750935806336_10154750940436336 | To begin, one of the first things the email release highlights is that back in July, Huma Abedin testified in a deposition where she indicated that Hillary Clinton destroyed a ton of her schedules when she was Secretary of State.Ask yourself, why would Hillary Clinton put hundreds of her own travel logs in a burn bag to have destroyed? The deposition also reveals that Abedin was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù with a sensitivedocument, emailing another aide to let her know Clinton‚Äôs schedule was left sitting on a bed in an unlocked hotel room. They obviously do not care about keeping our secrets protected or they wouldn‚Äôt continue to be so careless.To make matters even worse, WikiLeaks reveals that Huma Abedin had access to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Secretary of State email address that wasn‚Äôt secured. Clinton often needed naps and clearly has a mental health issue, so she allowed Huma to use her email server to send replies and read what was coming through. To be clear, Huma did NOT have the clearance to operate under this capacity.

13 | Greg Berry | 40 | 10154750935806336_705648159590970 | Trump hasn't been an employee of ours....she has been...to think that she deserves a promotion to the top position is just ignorant and stupid....she should have been on unemployment years ago!
14 | Kara Anne McCroskey | 39 | 10154750935806336_1831177777117154 | I just can't believe that people will actually vote for this woman, I had higher hopes for the American people, stupid me. I am a woman and she is an embarrassment. Of all the woman who are better suited for the job this is the one that was chosen. I would never vote for her even if my life depended on it. She is not what America or the world needs. She is unfit to even be in any government position. She's not even fit to be a school janitor.
15 | Jeff Mcdonough | 52 | 10154750935806336_10154750950791336 | Hillary Clinton is the scum of the earth. She is sitting back with her buddies Obama, Soros, and Satan and watching the world burn.She will say and do anything to get what she wants, and all the sheep behind her will follow! She is ALL that is wrong with the Political system and for anyone to support her after all she has done and said are mentally deficient.Why are we rewarding lawlessness and incompetence? Obama was re-elected despite constantly getting our troops killed, his incredibly low labor usage, declining wage growth, and skyrocketing health care costs. He made it his mission to provide ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù care with the ACA, yet my rates doubled up to $500/month (compare this with my ever decreasing car insurance rates‚Ä¶ only $25/month from Insurance Panda now). Yet we voted him in for 8 years? And we want to elect Hillary? I ask this question in all sincerity and not as a hostile commentary:Does there exist, anywhere on this planet, a more disgusting, vile, and reprehensible woman, both inside and out, than Hillary Rodham Clinton?
16 | Katie Scala | 48 | 10154750935806336_705663242922795 | Disgusting, but Ohio is going to vote Trump. I see thousands of Donald trump signs everywhere and virtually no Hillary signs üíØüëè

21 | Mary Lessard | 33 | 10154750935806336_705650659590720 | Hillary Clinton is a narcissistic pathological liar that put our national security at risk. She was in on selling uranium to Russia and tells the entire world the launch time for a nuclear weapon.

At a campaign event on Monday, Hillary Clinton spoke about the FBI reopening the investigation into her private email server and said, "There is no case here."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jack Ciri | 6030 | 10154750454846336_10154750509146336 | You know what I noticed, and is disgraceful? All of Hillary's cohorts wear a Hillary lapel pin, not an American Flag pin such as is customary and respectable. These idiots swear their allegiance to Hillary, not America.
2 | Robert Anthony | 4685 | 10154750454846336_10154750515766336 | In the year 2000 I had the privilege of working on Mr. Trump‚Äôs security staff in the Trump Tower. Let me just say that he is a real man, a real boss, and a real caring and loving person.He and his personal bodyguard Matt Calamari (now Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice-President) treated us like family and when we came into contact with Mr. Trump we addressed him as Mr. Trump, or Sir, not because it was something we were told to do, but rather out of respect. I hold Mr Trump in the highest regard.On 9/13/2001 I was walking out of the pile of concrete, steel, glass, and human debris that was Ground Zero as Mr. Trump was walking in. I think he was with Kevin or Brian (bodyguards), not sure which, but I addressed Mr. Trump and gave him a few breathing masks, then exited the site. This was months after I left the TRUMP organization for family issues.No more then one hour later I was receiving calls from Trump Tower stating that Mr. Trump was very proud to see me lending a hand to help our people and that they would like me to come back to work in the TRUMP organization.This is personal for me, and as a 100% disabled veteran fighting medical bills that the VA refuses to pay I know I need a man like Mr. Trump to stick up for people like me and for the rest of our great nation.God Bless Mr. Trump and God Bless America!‚Äù
3 | John McAuliffe | 2911 | 10154750454846336_10154750508671336 | Let the investigation tell us that. I'm sure Hillary, a former lawyer, will understand if we don't just take her word for it
4 | Andrew Tucker | 1076 | 10154750454846336_10154750513921336 | Just like there wasn't an embassy in Benghazi. She cannot recognize a disaster when it's right in front of her and enveloping her.
5 | Amir Parvez | 1014 | 10154750454846336_10154750509856336 | Hillary Clinton is a threat to American Democracy (what's left of it) and world peace. A vote for her is a vote for worldwide economic slavery and evil, endless war! She's a corrupt, evil, lying warmonger who already has blood on her hands of thousands of people and millions of dollars of blood money in the Clinton Foundation. #NeverHillary
6 | Carlhens Baptiste | 655 | 10154750454846336_10154750511521336 | I bet the FBI and the American people beg to differ. I mean I didn't expect her to say anything other than that. Obviously.
7 | John Noh | 541 | 10154750454846336_10154750525171336 | It was not a mistake, Mrs. Clinton. You had every intention of creating the server to hide whatever you were scheming from seeing the light of day. A mistake would be sending an email from the wrong account because the email client auto-corrected to the last one used.
8 | Vicki Dean | 364 | 10154750454846336_10154750516806336 | I am sure hillary has no idea what huma and/or weiner had in that folder "Life Insurance" - I am also sure it was there to protect them from her and has to be damning enough to keep them alive....
9 | James P Heidl | 292 | 10154750454846336_10154750518251336 | How can Democrats be so delusional it just baffles my mind to look at the evidence before you hit this woman terrible Behavior and not understand what she's about she didn't make a mistake how does educated smartest woman in the world make a mistake by using an illegal server when it's just unbelievable
10 | Julia Beckman Rickett | 268 | 10154750454846336_10154750515421336 | it wan't a mistake, it was an intentional act. You who worked on the watergate case thought if you could delete all the evidence (unlike Nixon), you'd never have to answer for your crimes
11 | Leanne Belk | 235 | 10154750454846336_1096459100390605 | I just love Hillary's response, as well as others supporting her, to how wrong it is for the FBI to come forward and accuse her of wrong doings with no proof other than his words...BUT...when they brought several women forward accusing Trump of wrong doing with no proof...that seemed to be just fine! Although I trust Comey a little more than the women who have yet to start any lawsuits against him. If you dish it, you better be able to take it!
12 | Stacy Cox | 172 | 10154750454846336_10154750526341336 | It's not a mistake, it's a crime. Are you really this stupid or just pretending to be a total IDIOT?. You cannot be trusted. You cannot work for us. We have returned your resume with a letter to inform you we have chosen a different applicant that Better fits our requirements. Thank you for applying.
13 | Diane Bowman | 139 | 10154750454846336_10154750522996336 | I've always called the Clinton's Teflon, that nothing ever sticks...But then there comes a time when even the best Teflon skillet gets burned and no longer works...hoping this is enough fire to ruin that coating and expose the truth.
14 | Mike Camire | 100 | 10154750454846336_10154750521396336 | She is similar to OJ, he didn't pay for his murder but his past finally caught up with him, just like the 30 years of corruption has finally caught up with her. #DrainTheSwamp  #HillaryForPrison
15 | James Semler | 92 | 10154750454846336_1837891943122300 | Dear Hillary Clinton,You're panicking. You're also very very stupid. You brought this all on yourself. The FBI wouldn't reopen your email case if they didn't have anything. Accept defeat and die a slow miserable painful death. America will be better off without you. Sincerely, The Awaken American Public
16 | Vicki R Krout Cope | 58 | 10154750454846336_10154750528846336 | I'm shocked and disgusted that there are people still following her to these events, then I reminded myself of the fact that jellyfish survived for 650 million years despite not having brains gives hope to these people.
17 | Toni Smith | 53 | 10154750454846336_1837882866456541 | The evidence of her negligence in this email case is overwhelming. She should have been arrested and charged the first time. You don't need immunity or need to destroy evidence and lie about it numerous times if you haven't done anything wrong. The mafia can't hold a candle to Bill and Hillary Clinton. They both are the epitome of corruption and deceit.
18 | Ian Michael Renwick | 67 | 10154750454846336_10154750515851336 | Of course it was a mistake, as she admits, but she wants to be spared from the consequences of her mistake. She reflects exactly what is wrong with this society.
19 | Bernie Paramore | 51 | 10154750454846336_10154750527931336 | The only difference is this time, after comey caved into you and obama and saw his reputation destroyed, I believe he will do what he should have done the first time and that is to prosecute. If lynch tries to interfere for obama there will be dire consequences for his whole criminal corrupt administration including him.
20 | Michael Kenitzer | 55 | 10154750454846336_10154750525381336 | "Attention idiotic lemmings, I mean My Voters hurry and vote for me before they show you even more of my corruption"- Hillary Clintonsubtitle of her speech
21 | Carol Rucker | 43 | 10154750454846336_1799011837012981 | I beg to differ with you dahlink!!! Obviously they wouldnt have gone this far doing this without ammunition!!!!! Time to drain the swamp!!!! BTW were is your USA pin? Ahhh well for good reason you arent for the USA your for yourself like you have been for the last 30 yrs!!!!!!!!!
22 | Danny Cole | 27 | 10154750454846336_1837884483123046 | Ah killary:1. You were fired from watergate for lying2. You are a protege of Sal Alinski3. You defended, freed, laughed and bragged (it's on tape) about the child rapist you got off. He raped a 12 year old girl so badly she was in a comma for 5 days, had wall to wall genital stitches, and can never have children. You stated in court that the little girl fantasizes about older men.4. You defended your rapist husband then diligently worked to slander his victims5. You did nothing to help the poor soldiers and ambassador in Benghazzi. You sent no help, even though you knew it was a military attack by alqueda.6. You have taken at least $25 million from Saudi Arabia, and who knows how much from Qatar. The two places that completely use and abuse women and children. They also support terrorists. 7. Your wonderful lesbian lover Abedin put all kinds of "life insurance" emails on her pedophile husbands laptop, so she and he could black mail you later for it.You deleted 33k emails and skated free while Martha Stewart went to jail for far less.8. You stole the election from Bernie Sanders in a rigged primary election.9. You slandered, lied, and tried to destroy Donald J. Trump with false accusations that your own husband has been doing for decades.10. You are the biggest, most vile, most disgusting, evil, pig of a human that has ever walked this Earth. You make Obama look like the best president ever even though, he is in fact, the worst president we have ever had.Nothing, not even a a Tsunami can keep me from voting for Trump on Nov. 8.#neverhillary#forevertrumpI have never been a religious person but on nov 8, after I vote, I'm going to fast and pray all day long in hopes that god will not let hitlery become president!
23 | Chantel Hughes | 45 | 10154750454846336_10154750519966336 | Thanks Hill, I'm sure everyone feels much better now üôÑ There was a case and still is a case, you put Americans at risk for your pay for play. Please don't tell us there is "no case".
24 | Maya Shusterman | 25 | 10154750454846336_1096463473723501 | There was a case and there is a case! If Hillary still has a smidgen of decency left she will admit the truth to everything she had done wrong and fold her campaign effective immediately! If there is still that smidgen of decency with all she has done and all the legal issues she is still facing, she needs to have the curtesy not to cause anymore disarray on the American people and step down.
25 | Tony Gatas | 35 | 10154750454846336_1837882173123277 | I can't believe how many woman where asked why are you Voting for Hillary and the response was,because she is a woman! Then they asked name something she has done for the American people, not one person could answer that question. Just shows you how stupid these supporters are.

1 | Ashoo Desai | 2694 | 10154749935431336_10154750377611336 | The most corrupt "family" to ever infest our government..... despicable, evil, anti Constitution, Anti Military, Anti American..... pay for play, traitors. Clinton Family üëé
2 | Steven Tucker | 2235 | 10154749935431336_10154750375441336 | Why didn't Hillary report it when Donna Brazile leaked her the questions to the CNN debate? How unethical is Hillary? That is the ultimate question. She could have said something right then so the questions could be changed, she could have earned a little respect. Instead, she used those questions she learned to throw worthless jabs at Trump. She is a liar and a hypocrite.
3 | Raymond Whitsel | 1336 | 10154749935431336_10154750386516336 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...

5 | Elizabeth Ismael Ruiz | 325 | 10154749935431336_10154750385116336 | America has too many urgent issue's to take care of e.g. healthcare, ISIS, immigration, jobs, education, economy, deficit to bring in ALL of Clinton's criminal baggage to the equation and further delay the important issues to focus on her FBI INVESTIGATION. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON FOR PRISON JUSTICE FOR AMERICA
6 | Donald Wellner | 278 | 10154749935431336_10154750383236336 | If Hillary Clinton somehow wins we need to all come together and march to the White House and all the local government offices throughout the country and demand change now! She can not be president by any means!!!
7 | Amir Parvez | 329 | 10154749935431336_10154750376561336 | Hillary Clinton is a threat to American Democracy (what's left of it) and world peace. A vote for her is a vote for worldwide economic slavery and evil, endless war! She's a corrupt, evil, lying warmonger who already has blood on her hands of thousands of people and millions of dollars of blood money in the Clinton Foundation. #NeverHillary
8 | Kimberly Timothy Wilson | 167 | 10154749935431336_10154750436311336 | The whole country needs to Unite NOW and Vote for Trump and Republican across the board so Trump will have a Republican majority in the House and Senate so he can drain the Epic Hillary Corruption out of the swamp in Washington before we become a Socialist Republic under United Nations! Wake up fast people! Obama and Hillary are dangerously close to making the United States a Socialist Republic! All they need now is to get Hillary elected to finish up their agendas! Don't listen to anymore of Hillary's lies people!
9 | Bill Collins | 125 | 10154749935431336_10154750383291336 | This stinks of Obama trying to get a third term, "constitutional crisis" is an excuse!I hope not but who knows these days!
10 | Wanda Smithpeters | 111 | 10154749935431336_10154750391221336 | I am so glad he came around.  He was an ardent support of Hillary.  There comes a point in time when people can no longer stomach the criminal activity.
11 | Elizabeth F-p | 30 | 10154749935431336_10154750381461336 | Anyone who equates Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúissues‚Äù with Donald Trump‚Äôs Corruption has no idea of the facts. Consider, for example, Trump‚Äôs illegal contribution to Florida‚Äôs attorney general, Pam Bondi, after she received multiple complaints from Florida students that they were cheated by Trump University. Once she received a $25,000 donation from Trump, her office dropped the inquiry.Or Trump‚Äôs solicitation of campaign funds from foreign officials, in clear violation of federal campaign laws.Or Trump‚Äôs refusals to pay contractors who have done work for him, many of them small businesses.Or Trump University‚Äôs repeated scams.Or the Trump Network, a pyramid scheme in violation of federal securities regulations.Or Trump Model Management, which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U.S. illegally.Or Trump‚Äôs employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts, claiming he couldn‚Äôt find Americans to do the work.Or Trump‚Äôs history of being charged with housing discrimination.Or Trump‚Äôs illegal dealings with Cuba while it was under embargo.Or Trump Foundation operating illegally.The list goes on. Donald Trump has a proven record of corruption. Hillary Clinton does not. Anyone who equates the two hasn't been paying attention.It would be nice to have an FBI investigation into these facts on Trump. I agree! I don't understand why Trump's errors and corruption are constantly ignored and this man laughs all including the FBI that instead of doing their job, create intrigue to favor Republicans. I VOTED FOR HILLARY CLINTON, BLUE ALL THE WAY.
12 | David Robinson | 16 | 10154749935431336_1210046692387125 | What Doug Schoen just stated is reason enough for obama to pardon HRC and avoid millions of dollars in court proceedings. HOWEVER, she did not and could not commit all the crimes she is accused of by herself. Heads need to roll all the way to the top (obama). Our government is corrupt and needs to heal. Absolving HRC is not going to heal the hurt. The truth needs to be made public and the cause corrected. Then the country can move on and grow. What to do November 8th????don't allow the Clinton machine anywhere near Washington DC.
13 | John Theron Casto | 25 | 10154749935431336_10154750458866336 | There is a lot of blame to go around.  First, Hillary, for being a criminal. Second, the Obama administration for hindering Hillary's investigation every step of the way. Third, the DNC for choosing a queen and then forcing her to the forefront, often unethically. Fourth, the adoring media, that blatantly campaigned for Hillary and forgot about what real journalism is all about. And fifth, the sheep that will vote for her regardless of what she does, because they have no capacity for independent thought or reason secondary to being indoctrinated by the first four.
14 | Misty Ventris Hefley | 27 | 10154749935431336_795868790555994 | Thank you Doug Schoen, I sincerely appreciate your honesty and for publicly stating  your decision to be an American first above a political party! As a Republican I can honestly say that I have always valued your opinion and views during this presidential race. I've looked to you for fair and balanced comments and facts to base my outlook on this election. Thank you for your honesty and for putting the future of America first!
15 | Glen Lewis | 38 | 10154749935431336_10154750401326336 | I admire you Mr. Schoen for your honesty and courage to state the truth knowing you will receive certain Dem backlash.  I enjoy listening to your commentary on TV.  I am a strong Trump supporter and my hat's off to you as I believe you are an honorable man.
16 | Mike Gill | 32 | 10154749935431336_10154750408506336 | Clinton should be out. All the government is doing is losing the respect of the American people . This is the most corrupt thing we have ever seen and it keeps getting worse .
17 | Peter Bouffard | 25 | 10154749935431336_10154750430501336 | Dems were giddy when some Republicans announced they couldn't support Trump, calling them "principled."  Let's see what they say about this development.
18 | Michael Young | 16 | 10154749935431336_795872113888995 | If you vote for Hillary, you are basically stating that you accept and support corruption.  Under no circumstance is that acceptable in any position, especially for President of the United States.
19 | Deb Kohaut | 14 | 10154749935431336_10154750444221336 | This whole thing is sickening!!!  This family is so corrupted and needs to just get out of the public eye and go away! Can u imagine a former president who was impeached actually sitting in the Oval Office again! Gross!
20 | Sandy Shive Wendt | 5 | 10154749935431336_1210066275718500 | Finally Doug Schoen sees  the conflict of voting for Clinton. Lies, deceit and more! Has always been true with the Clintons and always will be! Disgusting and evil people! Can NEVER trust a liar!!! She certainly is that, along with her lying husband!!!
21 | Brian L. Noveske | 15 | 10154749935431336_10154750411706336 | Being sorry for email and private server doesn't excuse you from breaking a high ranking law!!!!!" Do the Crime, do the time!!" We would have to??( Lying AND destruction of evidence to FBI AND Judicial Dept .even worse???)(many others probably involved for many years??)
22 | Felicia Clark-Peaseley | 5 | 10154749935431336_1210079642383830 | At least he is honest and understands the magnitude of this problem! Then to find out Killery was given questions prior to the debate with Bernie by Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor as well as DNC interim chair, just adds to the overwhelming problem of how Killery get things done. I would not be surprised to see Huma commit suicide or die of a mysterious illness or accident. Those who provide a negative light on Killery, whether on purpose or not, have a way of dying before giving testimony! I see this happening here too! You Killery supporters need to evaluate why you are voting for her! She truly is "dirty" and "corrupt"!
23 | Lorraine Modzelewski | 12 | 10154749935431336_795863650556508 | My advice - don't let it happen. C'mon republicans get out there and vote for Trump...Keep in mind the Supreme Court. Hillary will destroy our constitution.
24 | Kim Sprague | 9 | 10154749935431336_1210043149054146 | Well, I guess according to the article I just read, he's not voting for Clinton and he says he's not voting for Trump either. Then Sir, your opinion is no longer valid! Unless you show up at the polls and vote, you have no voice!
25 | Sally Spettigue | 4 | 10154749935431336_645991768912771 | Who's going to stand up and finally, finally announce she has already been disqualified to run for POTUS?! For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here‚Äôs what it says:‚Äù(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes andcarries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.

2 | Rebecca Faciane | 58 | 10154750226326336_10154750341446336 | I just listened to HRC blast Trump again. Why didn't she turn away his contributions if he is such a wicked person. She also said he would give the middle east nukes. Correct me if I am wrong but didn't Iran get all kinds of benefits when the farce of a deal was made for them. I cannot believe the lies that comes out of that woman's mouth.

4 | Lisa Ledford | 96 | 10154750226326336_10154750257751336 | CRITICAL LIFE LESSON ."Do you know how to catch wild pigs?".There was a chemistry professor in a large college that had some exchange students in the class. One day while the class was in the lab, the professor noticed one young man, an exchange student, who kept rubbing his back and stretching as if his back hurt.The professor asked the young man what was the matter. The student told him he had a bullet lodged in his back. He had been shot while fighting communists in his native country who were trying to overthrow his country's government and install a new communist regime. In the midst of his story, he looked at the professor and asked a strange question. He asked: "Do you know how to catch wild pigs?"The professor thought it was a joke and asked for the punch line. The young man said that it was no joke. "You catch wild pigs by finding a suitable place in the woods and putting corn on the ground. The pigs find it and begin to come every day to eat the free food"."When they are used to coming every day, you put a fence down one side of the place where they are used to coming. When they get used to the fence, they begin to eat the corn again and you put up another side of the fence". "They get used to that and start to eat again.You continue until you have all four sides of the fence up with a gate in the last side". "The pigs, which are used to the free corn, start to come through the gate to eat that free corn again. You then slam the gate on them and catch the whole herd"."Suddenly the wild pigs have lost their freedom. They run around and around inside the fence, but they are caught. Soon they go back to eating the free corn. They are so used to it that they have forgotten how to forage in the woods for themselves, so they accept their captivity."The young man then told the professor that is exactly what he sees happening in America . The government keeps pushing us toward Communism/Socialism and keeps spreading the free corn out in the form of programs such as supplemental income, tax credit for unearned income, tax exemptions, tobacco subsidies, dairy subsidies, payments not to plant crops (CRP), welfare entitlements, medicine, drugs, etc., while we continually lose our freedoms, just a little at a time as the government forces us to participate in many of these programs whether or not we want to.One should always remember two truths: There is no such thing as a free lunch, and you can never hire someone to provide a service for you cheaper than you can do it yourself. If you see that all of this wonderful government "help" is a problem confronting the future of democracy in America, you might want to share this with your friends.  God help us all when the gate slams shut!Quote for today: "The problems we face today are there because the people who work for a living are now outnumbered by those that vote for a living."

9 | Shannon Britton | 17 | 10154750226326336_10154750429591336 | Yeah BECAUSE she was sharing those emails with Weiner or accessing them on that laptop & when the cops went to investigate his sexting with a minor they found the "lost" EMAILS on it. So yes ..thank you Huma for being as corrupt as Hillary but apparently not as apt at covering her tracks lol
10 | Jimmy Byquito | 31 | 10154750226326336_10154750311656336 | Just in: Clinton is now LEADING in polls in important battleground states, such as Qatar, Iraq, Iran, and Syria And hopefully soon...San Quentin !!!

12 | Jan Wade Stokes | 11 | 10154750226326336_10154750449931336 | I heard that the 650,000 emails on Weiner's laptop were in a folder marked "Life Insurance"!!!  Can that mean that Huma knew she had the smoking gun and was saving them so she didn't "accidentally" commit suicide??üò≥. She is lawyering up, so she can plea bargain for a deal with the emails!
13 | Lisa Lugo | 9 | 10154750226326336_10154750314216336 | Trump I love you but poor Huma is just a typical codependent. How else could she have stayed with her louse of a husband and that wretch of a boss. Reserve your thanks for Anthony Weiner, her backstabbing husband.
14 | Preye Ralf Konyefa | 4 | 10154750226326336_10154750317556336 | If you want to know what a Hillary Clinton presidency will be like, then look no further than S.Korea where their President is involved in huge scams and massive fraud and she also sent classified information to close family friends and alot more, but guess how the people found out? through hacked e-mails that were leaked to the public about her corruption and revealing of classified info to close friends, so now there is a massive protest for her to resign and like some you know she's all apologetic and all that, the " i'm sorry and it was a mistake" like a candidate you know, so why don't you tell your democrat and undecided voter friends and family members to find out for themselves about the anger, betrayal, and frustration in S.Korea today? And let them expect that from a certain Hillary Clinton administration, or wht do you think?
15 | Hugo Duenas | 1 | 10154750226326336_1138079146287995 | Emails blah blah blah blah, the real crook ripped off small business, students in a fake university, investors in never built condo and don't wanna show his taxes and real medical record .But besides that he sexual assaulted a bunch women , cheated on his wife's and taxes .

Huma did the cloud..and YOU DON'T DO THAT.
20 | Joseph Brown | 0 | 10154750226326336_1094799777282511 | Copy from Facebook page of Kevin M Carney(opposing Views.) A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!
21 | Theresa Miller Sanchez | 2 | 10154750226326336_10154750450201336 | Trump needs to settle down on the comments. Don't use any names, I would hate to see this take a wrong turn for Trump. Democrats will use anything they can against him.
22 | Robert Anthony | 3 | 10154750226326336_1138034662959110 | In the year 2000 I had the privilege of working on Mr. Trump‚Äôs security staff in the Trump Tower. Let me just say that he is a real man, a real boss, and a real caring and loving person.He and his personal bodyguard Matt Calamari (now Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice-President) treated us like family and when we came into contact with Mr. Trump we addressed him as Mr. Trump, or Sir, not because it was something we were told to do, but rather out of respect. I hold Mr Trump in the highest regard.On 9/13/2001 I was walking out of the pile of concrete, steel, glass, and human debris that was Ground Zero as Mr. Trump was walking in. I think he was with Kevin or Brian (bodyguards), not sure which, but I addressed Mr. Trump and gave him a few breathing masks, then exited the site. This was months after I left the TRUMP organization for family issues.No more then one hour later I was receiving calls from Trump Tower stating that Mr. Trump was very proud to see me lending a hand to help our people and that they would like me to come back to work in the TRUMP organization.This is personal for me, and as a 100% disabled veteran fighting medical bills that the VA refuses to pay I know I need a man like Mr. Trump to stick up for people like me and for the rest of our great nation.God Bless Mr. Trump and God Bless America!‚Äù
23 | Vickie Trudell | 1 | 10154750226326336_10154750481796336 | YES!  Just remember, our country would not be going through this now, if HilLIARy would not have been engaged in deception, every step of the way!!  Then again, she is just living up to her lifelong record of being the Queen of corruption, hypocrisy and lies!!!
24 | Henry Roberts | 3 | 10154750226326336_10154750316736336 | Don't get arrogant Donald, we still need to win. Quit wasting so much time on Hillary and advise us how you will be a great President for ALL Americans.
25 | Steve Jessop | 4 | 10154750226326336_10154750278171336 | Did Donald Trump really thanks a guy who is being investigated for sexting with a 15-year old girl? Will daughters be safe in a Trump Presidency???

CNN has severed ties with Donna Brazile after another leaked email showed the interim DNC chair shared a debate question with Hillary Clinton.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Susan Kimbro | 13769 | 10154750075056336_10154750084986336 | LMAO...does CNN really believe this little gesture will make them a legitimate news organization again?  That ship has sailed, and it's not coming back.
2 | Geoffrey McCloskey | 4330 | 10154750075056336_10154750085331336 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...
3 | Amir Parvez | 6415 | 10154750075056336_10154750079046336 | Hillary Clinton is a threat to American Democracy (what's left of it) and world peace. A vote for her is a vote for worldwide economic slavery and evil, endless war! She's a corrupt, evil, lying warmonger who already has blood on her hands of thousands of people and millions of dollars of blood money in the Clinton Foundation. #NeverHillary
4 | Gayle Reich | 2769 | 10154750075056336_10154750078871336 | AS if CNN didn't know?? This woman is probably just a scapegoat
5 | John Jason | 1400 | 10154750075056336_10154750090081336 | CNN is issuing damage control to save face and keep CNN as a major news source. They'll fire a few scapegoats for the time being and see if it dies down. Most of the people in CNN are on the Clinton ticket and are corrupt propagandists.
6 | Brenda Kimmel Crump | 1698 | 10154750075056336_10154750077171336 | Donna Brazile, the interim chairperson of the Democratic National Committee, is praying for divine intervention in the election. Brazile even quoted Psalm 130:5 and accompanied it with a message urging constituents to get out to voteha fine time to get religious now. you believe in murdering infants in the womb, believe in selling dead baby body parts, believe in allowing terrorists to come to our nation and rape our children, murder Christians, Jews and homosexuals, believe in taking away our religious rights and beliefs, - sorry donna this religious thing is not going to work for you. little too late prayer won't be heard. the Lord knows who is lying.
7 | Linda H Dunbar | 1140 | 10154750075056336_10154750082471336 | ALL of the journalists at cnn need to go!  Donna barzile was just one of many at cnn with either little, or NO moral compass!

9 | Amy Woodard Frazer | 759 | 10154750075056336_10154750084356336 | Trying to save face by pretending it was all Donna and not you CNN? Just like the HRC camp will make Huma the scapegoat... #wakeupamerica #CrookClinton
10 | Jeffrey Preyss | 330 | 10154750075056336_10154750078936336 | Lmao... cnn backs hillary anyways...poor Donna was simply a fall guy
11 | Mary Mealler | 308 | 10154750075056336_10154750093281336 | The fact that Donna Brazille gave Hillary "a" debate question in advance is SMALL - I believe Hillary received ALL the questions in advance, had notes on her podium AND had an ear piece in her ear  so that someone could help her give the "politically correct" answers.  Do we expect anything other than that from Hillary and her gang?  Frankly, I would be surprised if I ever heard they did anything in an honest, forthright fashion.  Do you think they would change how they operate if HC became the President?  I don't know how, but I believe it would get even more corrupt.
12 | Cody Choate | 197 | 10154750075056336_10154750087926336 | Okay what is going to be done about it? I guess being unethical means nothing. If Hillary Clinton is elected all that voted for her should be considered co-conspirators to all thier crimes..
13 | Tony Burroughs | 154 | 10154750075056336_10154750090351336 | With all of the corrupt BS going on with Hillary we still have brain dead idiots that will vote for her, this is why we need Donald Trump in office to make America great again.
14 | Shawna Compton | 168 | 10154750075056336_10154750084271336 | The fact that a presidential candidate that is a criminal suspect, being investigated by the FBI; is still allowed to remain in the race, it‚Äôs absolutely perturbing and dangerous to our Republic. Understand that if criminal Hillary Clinton, were to become the US President, we would be facing an unprecedented constitutional crisis that might be beginning of the end of the USA as the Nation where the rule of law and where the separation of powers prevail, and might be the start of a dictatorial tyranny.
15 | Lori Baird Thompson | 116 | 10154750075056336_10154750097156336 | Wasn't it brought to social media attention that Hillary was given some of the questions ahead of time....yet... everyone in the DNC screamed false and Snopes debunked it and said she had no prior knowledge....and now it comes out that the Republicans were right or somewhat right....
16 | Chris Moreen | 88 | 10154750075056336_986527684790925 | This came from the Advocate (a news paper) and I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump. The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."Like ¬∑ Reply ¬∑ 6 ¬∑

When questions were posed, not even four words into the question, she started to shake her head up and down, a clear subconscious reaction, she clearly knew the questions in advance!!! She has stooped to a level beyond the lowest level! How people can not see through this... all I can say is, the company selling those rose colored blinder glasses.... must be making a killing this year!!!
19 | Jimmy Christianson | 84 | 10154750075056336_592193854321565 | Remember when Obama said his administration would be the most transparent in history? Well thanks to Wikileaks's now they are, and now they're all pissed about it, liberal hypocrisy at its finest
20 | Joyce Rapier | 52 | 10154750075056336_1800636760151465 | Sorry, CNN, but you are no longer a viable news media with major bias toward your love child, Hillary Clinton. Too little too late. Clinton is so corrupt, her lies have corrupted everyone coming in contact with her. She probably has dossiers on all of you and any kind of dirt you might have scattered. While the news is giving her attention she is all smiles and when no one is looking, she stabs them in the back. Do you have on armor?

ALL are beginning to appear as corrupt as corrupt can be.  And they do not get reprimanded, admonished, or punished in any way, at all, ever, because they cling together like maggots on roadkill.

6 | Kahlor Krefting | 29 | 10154749795361336_10154749928926336 | Wait a shotgun? That can't be true. Everyone knows only semi-automatic black rifles can kill people. Was the shotgun black, that makes a big difference?

NOW everything Hillary did was using OUR government to get rich as well as not caring about Americans who was fighting our enemy's.

Then says she don't remember We can not have a president who can not remember what she did or didn't do.

19 | Lois Hargrave Blackwood | 4 | 10154749749061336_10154749783561336 | Let's not be premature here. These are Weiner's posts, probably has a bit of porn selfies and other such. May not have anything to do with the Clintons, then again, it might be the missing link. Only time will tell.
20 | BF Love | 2 | 10154749749061336_10154749816841336 | I perfectly see that you Americans are believed other nations fraud election across the world and that's really cool. But as I have seen right now your American election is dictated by giant media(Fox news) and government institutions(FBI) that is really really makes you fool and elections foolish!!! I believe American peoples are intellectually rich and better than the others so please be genuine & Dump Thramp then elect the powerful women on earth because your coming president will affect the world by any means!!!
21 | Jonathan Lawson | 2 | 10154749749061336_10154749836141336 | Hillary is scared!  That is why she is pushing early voting so much while Trump is just saying get out and vote on November 8th.  Sadly I see Obama pardoning her no matter what crimes she may have committed.
22 | Moti Gur | 0 | 10154749749061336_10154749952651336 | Unbelievable that Hillary is not in jail,  Federal Bureau of criminal Investigation against Hillary Clinton, FBI agents have found 650,000 emails on a laptop they believe was used by the husband of one of Hillary Clinton's aides, Huma Abedin.
23 | Mohammed Alam | 0 | 10154749749061336_569231653285038 | Yup...Trump thanked Anthony Weiner. One PERVERT thanks the other sexual predator. PussyGate ruined Weiner and the same PussyGate killed trump's chance to win this election. Douchebags!!!

25 | Arne Johnsen | 2 | 10154749749061336_10154749816756336 | A US navy soldier was imprisoned because he had six photographs of navy vessel he was on in 2009, the vessel was 40 years old, the government said it was classified material. Hillary used her private email server public when she was secretary of state, and delete 33k mail because she hiding something,   FBI say much classified material, but she goes free! This is too bad!

"We're on the precipice of yet another constitutional crisis because of the Clintons. This time, involving an alleged pedophile, our nation's top secrets and a couple of grifters from Arkansas."

1 | Kelly Huskins Clemmer | 874 | 10154749595591336_10154749666291336 | This is crap! So if Hillary say , broke into a house , the FBI couldn't say anything because it might jeopardize the election within 60 days of the election!!! What is wrong with y'all ???? She's a criminal and they have evidence of that who cares what day it is ? Maybe he could go to lynch maybe she is involved maybe the emails show her involved in some way . He can't go to her if that's the case !!!
2 | Debbi Dalton Babin | 816 | 10154749595591336_10154749667231336 | Stop it! We can do it... November 8th! I'm tired of trying to explain to me teenagers how correct they are. They listen, but they don't really know! They are criminals and Liars both of them!! get them the hell out of Washington!
3 | Greg Merrill | 613 | 10154749595591336_10154749661546336 | Hillary Clinton is legally ‚Äúdisqualified from holding any office under the United States‚Äù due to her violation of U.S. Code Title 18 Part I Chapter 101 Section 2071. We demand that the United States Department of Justice act to enforce the law & indict her ending her presidential campaign & causing her to face up to three years in prison.The full text of the law is an follows:‚ÄúWhoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States‚Äù.
4 | Ray Davis | 330 | 10154749595591336_10154749665426336 | Killary would not qualify to be a cashier at Walmart. But oh my goodness it's ok for her to run for president. Are we really this screwed up?
5 | Linda Burchette | 195 | 10154749595591336_10154749695436336 | If Bill Clinton had not interfered in the investigation in the first place or if Hillary and her puppets had not destroyed evidence we would not have this action today! Of course the Clintons , George Soros, dishonest media and donors are livid! Never held accountable before! Vote to rid America of this corruption!
6 | Linda Spizzo Karpowich | 152 | 10154749595591336_10154749676971336 | Wherever the Clinton's go there is always always always a scandal. if the months leading up to the election any indication of how the next four years with her in office why would anyone want her as president? if she is elected this will not stop. it will continue. people can also say well Trump too. I will not argue that point, but his has been about words. is  he squeaky clean...probably not. But we know he will surround himself with brilliant people. We already know Ben Carson will head up Health Care. Huma knew there was another device out there, any why didn't she turn that device in. And why why why do these two ladies surround themselves with such sleaze bags of husbands????? And people say Hillary is a role model for their daughters? Seriously? i have a 21 year old daughter no way would I ever ever ever want her to have a role model like Hillary!
7 | Suzette Marie | 122 | 10154749595591336_10154749754671336 | Huma better get herself a personal body guard or she might end up having an "accident" like drop a barbell on her throat or mysteriously disappear and later be found in a park or some other fate like the other 46 people who were close to the Clintons who have died.... just saying..
8 | Peggi Calderaro | 81 | 10154749595591336_10154749751731336 | As much as I would like to believe this will open the blind eyes of the Hillary supporters, I won't hold my breath. They could find ten dead bodies buried in her backyard and the Dems would still vote her into office,
9 | BrianBuffet Naturalbodybuilder | 87 | 10154749595591336_10154749683321336 | More troubling is that people are voting for all this . Just think what will happen if she wins .... Does anyone think this will stop ? Voting for more scandals and more corruption and more security issues? How can anyone trust her after all that she has done . She even lied about the origin of her own name . Can't believe people think she would actually be a good president after all her bad decisions she has made . Decisions that were all about her and how she could profit from them . Do people actually believe she cares about the country . Anyone who puts our national security at risk for her convience using a unauthorized server is someone who doesent care about the law. The reason these laws were written were to protect us from people like her that leave us vulnerable to foreign countries . Then to make matters worse deletes the enails after she was told to hand them over . She learned from watergate what to do , she knows that even though the destruction of the emails looks bad letting people see what she did would put her in prison .She lied repeatedly over and over again . Just can't understand how people can justify her actions .How can a person think that she will be good for this country , what possible traits does she have ? She makes bad decisions . Her track record in the Middle East speaks for itself . If she gets into office and continues to do the same crooked things then we have no one to blame but ourselves for putting her in that position . What a nightmare. Aren't we tired of the Clinton's yet ? Aren't we tired of hearing about Bill and his behavior and Hilliary and her scandals ? Other countries got to be thinking that we are a bunch of idiots ... The Clinton's are crooks and  are an embarrassment to society
10 | Bob LeBeau | 47 | 10154749595591336_10154749715811336 | Hillary you & your husband Bill did lie to Congress The FBI & to all of AMERICA You both should be in Prison! Is this what AMERICA is all about letting the rich people get away with what the poor can't? As Christians we are with Israel....
11 | Daniel H Doxzen Jr | 16 | 10154749595591336_1800877850196733 | Nixon resigned, to spare the country a Constitutional crisis, while Clinton, after having been impeached, by The House, continued his presidency, and this is the difference between conservative republicans, and liberal democrats.
12 | Susan Conery | 13 | 10154749595591336_1266003600123792 | America is finally fed up with these scam artists who have served nothing and no one but themselves and their own interests for decades.
13 | Keith Kilgore | 15 | 10154749595591336_1784964671745582 | Judge Jeanine Pirro - I LOVE your enthusiasm, and your SPOT ON assessment of what is happening to our nation.We, as a People, MUST NOT ALLOW this to be swept under the carpet, again.
14 | Bob Runkle | 9 | 10154749595591336_1800883370196181 | The FBI's credibility is on the line and if they don't clean this up President Trump will and I don't think their going to like that at all. In the mean time how can the Democrat Party continue to hawk this woman so consumed by controversy and scandal. Is this what we want for the next 4 years? Screw this! I'm voting TRUMP!
15 | Suzanne Carlisle Petty | 17 | 10154749595591336_1265984323459053 | Exactly #JudgeJeanine this whole scandal is crazy!! And why is someone running for president of the U.S. able to run while being investigated by the FBI??? So disgusted with the Clinton's thinking they are above the law!! Trump in 2016!
16 | Claudia Gusler | 19 | 10154749595591336_1265995736791245 | Huma, from Saudi Arabia, is very active in her family business, promoting the Muslim Brotherhood. And she has access to this country's top secrets???  Hillary is very aware of this. Saudi Arabia gave millions of dollars to Hillary's campaign. Pay back is hell...for America!
17 | Holly Roy | 18 | 10154749595591336_10154749699061336 | Take trump out of the equation and ask yourself. At what lengths will Hillary supporters defend her lies. Something like the OJ Simpson case. It is scary for our nation. Proof after proof of corruption and lies. Nation of sheep just waiting to follow this corrupt person over the cliff. Very sad
18 | Dennis Newhouse | 13 | 10154749595591336_10154749791526336 | You can probably blame this all on Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch little meeting they had and why this wasn't investigated more! Also I'm sure Obama had his little part in it all!Bunch of crooks!Drain the swamp!
19 | Steve Callen | 9 | 10154749595591336_1800874796863705 | Funny thing, all of a sudden the Dems are screaming "violation of the hatch act...." But for the past three months I have heard all of them, Hillary Clinton included, make claims that 7 different federal organizations have linked Trump to the Russians and the DNC hacks.... If James Comey alerting congress of newly found evidence in a federal investigation is a violation of the hatch act... then what the hell would you call "7 federal organizations" informing Hillary and the democratic party that they were investigating Trump's links to the Russian hacks..and Hillary repeating that information in public 142 times in the last two months? It's REALLY funny, Hillary said "releasing information like that with so little details is strange, unprecedented, and down right troubling" , well, to that I say...what kind of details are there in " 7 federal organizations have linked Trump to the Russians and the DNC hacks"? Linked how Hillary? If there are links, bring them out, get it all out on the table, show those links...I find it strange, unprecedented and down right troubling that 7 federal organizations would release statements like that, with so little details. HYPOCRITE ALERT!!!
20 | Vicky Hickerson | 10 | 10154749595591336_10154749746701336 | Thank you Judge Jeanine Pirro for speaking up for the American people.  Stay strong and keep up the good work.  By the way, does anyone remember when George W. Bush took office he wanted to be able to communicate with his college student daughters on a private devise and they told him it would be public record/property.  I've been trying to search for the news article about it, but have not been able to find it.
21 | Bert Berkowitz | 12 | 10154749595591336_10154749675001336 | From what they're saying there are states that vote democratic every four years which tells me that if a Castro was a Democrat he could be elected president of the United States in those states.
22 | Ben Quijada | 14 | 10154749595591336_10154749688071336 | Yep. And when the coward in WH pardons those "Arkansas grifters" as a welcome mat to the WH, we all can take pride in our Constitution, our democracy, our Republic. We did it to ourselves and our childrens future, tools for statism. WTF is wrong with all you Americans?
23 | Julie Mendez | 5 | 10154749595591336_1784952361746813 | I agree!! Once and for all let's get to the truth. Comey can go down in history as the truth teller, don't let Washington lie to We the People. Let the chips fall where they may, whether Democratic or Republican. We deserve the truth.
24 | Jennifer Hajdics | 7 | 10154749595591336_10154749693396336 | If the new Clinton emails, which were found on a server not belonging to her, in an investigation into a politician sending pictures of his dick to a 15 year old NC girl contain Trump's tax returns, then I'll care.
25 | Dominic Huerta | 7 | 10154749595591336_10154749755926336 | To Hillary, Her campaign folks, and to her supporters... I'm gonna quote President Obama here, so bear with me......"Stop Whining"The system isn't rigged. FBI director isn't trying to bring down Hillary's candidacy. No he's hunting for a criminal, and she's in his crosshairs."She created this mess and she knows it."

Researchers have uncovered the stone slab in Jerusalem‚Äôs Church of the Holy Sepulchre venerated as the resting place of Jesus Christ.

2 | Lanny Heinlen | 1699 | 10154740529116336_10154749578646336 | He is risen, He has risen indeed. I'm not sure why since Jesus is resurrected why this is even a story. It seems to me the emphases is on the wrong thing. The tomb is empty. By the way today is REFORMATION DAY!
3 | David Levi | 1049 | 10154740529116336_10154749568571336 | Also, The Clintons corruption slab uncovered for the first time in centuries

5 | Terry Moshier | 965 | 10154740529116336_10154749603126336 | This is NOT the resting place of Jesus, as He is ALIVE and seated at the right hand of God in Heaven. Jesus AROSE and walked out of His burial tomb! He walked and talked with many for 40 days and then ascended into Heaven before their very eyes.
6 | Brendan Brown | 778 | 10154740529116336_10154749567806336 | If they dig far enough, they might find Clinton's soul in Hell
7 | Kristen E Stieger | 638 | 10154740529116336_10154749593836336 | Even though the tomb may be opened you won't find a body as Jesus arose from the dead and his body is no longer there. IF for some reason they say they find a body NO ONE should believe it as that would not be true. Get in your Bible's for the truth. God Bless.
8 | Joyce Ann | 373 | 10154740529116336_10154749568326336 | Ummmmmm..... isnt this WRONG ?!?  Why is this being disturbed ?  Not sure, but if the heavens open up and fire comes down.... I didn't do it....
9 | Denise Johnson Croft | 276 | 10154740529116336_10154749582546336 | As my husband point out, this statement is wrong. "The rock surface, or ‚Äúburial bed‚Äù was hewn from the side of a limestone cave following Christ‚Äôs crucifixion, according to Christian tradition." It was a borrowed tomb, not made after the crucifixion.
10 | Ryan Folwell | 185 | 10154740529116336_10154749597056336 | And he isn't there because he is risen!! No other world religious figure can claim that distinction. Only Jesus Christ rose out of the grave because he is the Messiah!!
11 | Loida Amaro | 101 | 10154740529116336_10154749583471336 | Jesus is alive... there is no resting place as he lives!!!!!
12 | Mary Ann Riddle | 111 | 10154740529116336_10154749578541336 | The real story is...Jesus is not there anymore ‚ù§Ô∏è
13 | John Wright | 119 | 10154740529116336_10154749620291336 | You may have found the tomb, but you won't find the savior. He is on the right hand of the Lord! It is so good to worship a risen savior!
14 | Kathryn Iandoli | 49 | 10154740529116336_10154749613556336 | He has no resting place on earth. He is not here, he is with his Father in heaven. He rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.

In my life, it has always been the people with some kind of religious belief that have stopped and helped me when I needed it. Just honestly good, kind people. There's a song by Brad Paisley that I love called Those Crazy Christians that is a great description of that. "They look to heaven their whole lifeAnd I think what if they're wrong but what if they're rightYou know it's funny, much as I'm baffled by it allIf I ever really needed help, well you know who I'd callIt's those crazy Christians."
18 | Micheal Cope | 28 | 10154740529116336_1566942996664443 | The carpenters son isn't there. He sits on the right hand of GOD ALMIGHTY making intercession for the children on GOD. Soon he will make his appearance on earth again as it is written of him in the books of the old prophets and the book of the Revelation. He will be revealed to the world for what he is now and has always been, GOD'S son, the lamb of GOD that taketh away the sins of the world.Even so LORD, come quickly. Amen.
19 | Gino Scolari | 52 | 10154740529116336_10154749569021336 | Did they find the Rest of Hillarys emails in there as well?

I understand there were horrible history that the christians have done but they are not welcomed as the idea on how a real christian should be.

21 | William Leas | 12 | 10154740529116336_10154749633036336 | Just a slab of rock...big deal! Jesus was a Jew killed by the Romans but persecuted by the old Jewish Rabbis whom suspected there was something wrong about him! Maybe there was? But all the evidence has turned to dust long ago! Unless there is a DNA sample somewhere, it's a question that can't be answered
22 | Shawna Lynne Hoffman | 16 | 10154740529116336_10154749624856336 | Actually this is just one site where it was thought that Was Jesus' tomb. The church of the Holy Sepulchre is the Roman Catholic traditional site of Christ's burial. There is a second site called the Garden tomb that would be outside of the city limits during Jesus' time. Because Jews did not have burial sites within their cities and towns it is questionable of the validity of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher being the burial site since it would have been within the city. However there is so much history that is found with in these churches! I love appreciating all that the Church has to offer and learning from the history that has been preserved.
23 | Sandy Finney | 16 | 10154740529116336_1148889971845183 | Forget about the search for something Jesus Christ may have touched while here on earth and let the real Jesus Christ touch your heart. Seek to have a real relationship with the Living God.

25 | Michael VanVolkinburg | 22 | 10154740529116336_10154749605351336 | Jesus raised from the tomb after 3 days. He can't have an earthly "resting place." Someone didn't read the rest of the story.

He was just a kid with his hands up, buying skittles, and they MURDERED him. Theys be tryna genocide us! Wake up white America, they're hunting us like animals!!! Statistics show that us whites are murdered by cops more than any other race! They're targeting us because of the color of our skin! #whitelivesmatter

11 | Desmond Coleman | 6 | 10154749446771336_10154749667601336 | And yet, these peckerwoods still don't see the difference. That hick was armed and had a shootout with pigs, as to where sooooo many unarmed black people are killed by pigs almost instantly.
12 | Dawna Huff | 4 | 10154749446771336_10154749542046336 | The Muslim president of the United States and the narcissistic lunatic üñïIng criminal abating this criminal because he's either Mexican or he's Muslim my even be Latino and they support them before the American people ..they been committing crimes for years and no one seems to have known so what's to say they're not hiding this criminal out and feeding him and house in Him you know that kind of stuff nothing would surprise me with this üñïIng BarackObama administration
13 | Michael Nathan Ulibarri | 1 | 10154749446771336_1067844576658429 | Was he an unarmed teen? A child playing with a toy gun in a park?A special needs assistant laying on the ground with his hands up pleading don't shoot?Or how about a man with a broke down vehicle with his hands up? If a person is walking around shooting innocent people, regardless of skin color they deserve to be gunned down. The revolt is more than than people of color being gunned down, it's also the justice system not doing their job for the victims.
14 | Ed Crenshaw | 1 | 10154749446771336_1067803866662500 | I come to this site of üí©kicking bigots to confirm that racist are still alive and well! You tell kids that racism is not as rampant but this site proves otherwise! A white killer was killed in a shootout with police a man who is known to have committed murder and was on the run! Many of the black men killed were NOT wanted for murder OR running from the cops! I did the job for 21 years and it's a tough job performed by brave men and women! But many of the recent shootings are not MORALLY justified! When reading these post can make me a person who was a cop as my father before me I cringe at the racist bigotry in defense of questionable police shootings! I would say go to Hell but I think karma will suffice!
15 | Rebecca Boening | 1 | 10154749446771336_1775565789373875 | I am relieved that he is no longer in public, but my prayers go out to his family. Between the Aunt and Uncle that he murdered and his death you know that his family has been through a very traumatic experience.   For them I pray üôèüèª
16 | Dawna Huff | 6 | 10154749446771336_10154749560741336 | now let's cross our fingers and all of our toes that üñïing Hillary rotten Clinton the narcissistic lunatic that's running for president with the most corrupt record of anybody in the history of America to run for president that should not be allowed to run for president will get the same üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
17 | Tiberius E Collins | 4 | 10154749446771336_10154749578131336 | So angry .time for a white riot.  Called all my friends and woke the neighbors,  but everyone was going or had gone to work . Maybe we will just sit back and wait for the police to finish their investigation and do their job but we are all still angry . yup, we all agree we are angry at that white piece of trash breaking the law and endangering innocent people.
18 | Karen Dianna Spicer | 0 | 10154749446771336_10154749803111336 | About 25 miles from where my son works alone at night. I told him the guy was around in that area because I like to shower him with random information and his response was "Hell, I don't give a f*ck."
19 | Tonya Wood | 2 | 10154749446771336_1067973026645584 | It does not matter what color he was. Bottom line is he broke the law..committed horrific crimes and then was stopped from hurting anyone else by OHP and all of the other awesome law enforcement officers out there. Justice has been served. A big thank you to the officers out there last night protecting and serving everywhere. May God bless all of you! Prayers also for the Sheriff that was injured last night in the process of protecting. Just remember everyone there is good and bad in all races. Last night the good guys won.
20 | Paul Fava | 3 | 10154749446771336_10154749655516336 | This was a story of a man on a mission 2 Destroy & Murder. Law enforcement did the right thing & I can't believe some of the remarks about this incident. He was an Animal & I'm Glad nobody else had 2 die...
21 | Eric Steven Ache√© | 0 | 10154749446771336_1067820149994205 | Oh no they di int! I'm gonna go burn down some white owned businesses to protest!! Why won't those racist cops just lay down and die like they deserve! How dare they try to defend themselves! Sounds stupid doesn't it?
22 | Krissy Boze Yates | 2 | 10154749446771336_10154749559651336 | Good. I'm not on the side of criminals. You respect the police and they will respect you. You do anything out of the ordinary, and you get shot? Tough ish. You should have been on the ground, apologizing for being a dumba$$.
23 | Joann Daniel McElhaney | 0 | 10154749446771336_10154749783046336 | Anyone who kills a cop  or anyone for that matter should be sentenced to death with no wait time. If you did it, time to pay the price for stupidness.
24 | Kristine Marler | 0 | 10154749446771336_10154749665361336 | It is saving money for the cost of a trial and housing this scumbag in prison.  Point a weapon at a cop, you are going to get shot.
25 | Scott Reece | 2 | 10154749446771336_10154749589881336 | With him killing family, and showing no regard for officers and bystanders, I hope it was a slow death and a painful one.  I normally don't feel that way, but that is what he deserved.

The mother of a U.S. Navy service member who was sentenced to prison time for mishandling classified information called out the "double standard" in her son's case compared to the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

1 | Wessley Newton | 3045 | 10154749364541336_10154749368836336 | No offense media and government but I don't take you serious anymore, I've watched people tell Trump to step down for saying Pu$$y 11 years ago and still not one person has even questioned Hillary running, you people are a joke
2 | Stacy Darin Zepeda | 1061 | 10154749364541336_10154749389196336 | This is just WRONG! Hillary keeps repeating Michelle Obamas phrase, "When they go low, we go high". There's a lot of truth to that. Hillary went so high, now she's above the law...and that's sad!
3 | Milton Hillgartner | 517 | 10154749364541336_10154749407706336 | Anyone with her years of experience in government would recognize by the contents of the email whether it should be marked as classified. If she can't by the time she was Secretary of State, then she has no business occupying the white house!
4 | L.t. Dean-Ausbun | 555 | 10154749364541336_10154749376471336 | There should be no Double Standard! #LockHerUp FBI don't drop the ball this time. Clean cut and justice for our Country and Benghazi!I'm voting #TrumpPence16
5 | CJ Del | 432 | 10154749364541336_10154749373706336 | That's the basis of this election. It's not just about if you like Trump. It's about if you like the current political system that separates the people from the politician. We are subject to different standards. The Clintons represent everything people hate about the elites and politicians. It is literally us (We The People) against them (the elites).
6 | Bill Boman | 202 | 10154749364541336_10154749412726336 | Bola Muyis, please watch this lady speak about the Double Standards between her Son and Hillary Clinton.  That's what I was telling you the other day WHY I believe she is guilty. This lady's Son is in Jail and Hillary is NOT! And they both committed the same crime, classified information on an unsecure devise.
7 | Wayne Merryman | 173 | 10154749364541336_10154749379866336 | If hilLIARy is PUT in office and America doesn't stand up to this blatant power grab, I predict domestic terrorism will skyrocket, IF we don't break out in a civil war.
8 | TerriAnn Clidence Arrington | 124 | 10154749364541336_10154749422621336 | Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:‚Äú(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.‚ÄùYes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.CC/PASTED
9 | Raelyn Bowers | 142 | 10154749364541336_10154749388021336 | What happened to the Rule of Law in this country? If this service member was sent to prison for mishandling classified information, then Hillary should go too! Tired of the Clintons who are above the law and the double standard that they have!
10 | Arlene Viamontes | 59 | 10154749364541336_10154749406791336 | What happened to fair is fair. I don't care who you are if you missed handle our Classified information should be punish. Money should not matter and she should not be allowed to buy her way out of corruption.
11 | Dave Jennings | 34 | 10154749364541336_10154749467071336 | To Obama and the DNC Hillary can do no wrong, remember that Obama has released known terrorist from Gitmo, Hillary has accepted money from known terrorist harbouring countries. Obama chose to keep playing golf while Louisiana was under water. Hillary thinks it's OK to suck stem cells out of a unborn child who's heart is beating. And both ignored pleas for help for our soldiers and ambassador in Benghazi. So if you want 4 to 8 more years of nonsense like this then vote for Hillary, but remember what ever evil comes from it you own it.
12 | Kelli Henderson | 35 | 10154749364541336_10154749381021336 | You can not expect the media to produce unbiased newsworthy material. Most have already been bought and paid for by either Clinton herself or her DNC puppeteers prior to her announcement of running for President. People must do their own research in order to make a sound vote, but that is even laughable.
13 | Mike Lynn Hosler | 44 | 10154749364541336_10154749530691336 | 39 times Hillary told the FBI that she could not remember information about her e-mails, 5 members of the Clinton team took the 5th to avoid criminal action, and now Huma Abedin can not remember how 650,000 e-mails got on her computer...... we have to drain the swamp in Washington.....or we will lose our country.... walk-up America before its to late.......
14 | Amanda E. Connelly | 39 | 10154749364541336_10154749395861336 | Her supporters believe this is OK. They are 100% accepting of Hilary being treated as royalty because in their mind, she is royalty. They were never taught the Constitution and therefor have no idea why this is such a "big deal".
15 | Hugo Duenas | 23 | 10154749364541336_1634446236853660 | Emails blah blah blah blah, the real crook ripped off small business, students in a fake university, investors in never built condo and don't wanna show his taxes and real medical record .But besides that he sexual assaulted a bunch women , cheated on his wife's and taxes . The choice is clear , only one transparent person Hillary Clinton for POTUS! .....
16 | Cam Fleishman | 26 | 10154749364541336_10154749455801336 | Sorry for the double standard, but her son broke the law and should be punished. Now, we just have to get Hillary Clinton and her Minions behind bars.
17 | Richard Reeves | 26 | 10154749364541336_10154749505571336 | I had a security clearance for 40 plus years & would have lost my job or much worst if I had been careless with classified data.  How can anyone with an ounce of common sense vote for Killary????  Every time I see her on TV or hear her voice I fear for the future of America!
18 | Christina M VanGinkel | 24 | 10154749364541336_10154749418246336 | The reason FBI Director James Comey came forward so late? he needed a subpoena to look at the emails and no one would authorize one (probably all afraid of  becoming one of the Clinton Dead)...he had to push their hand by going public!
19 | Pattie Blecha Holter | 23 | 10154749364541336_10154749441416336 | I hold the MSM accountable for creating this monster named Hillary Clinton. They let her and the Obama administration get away with anything and now we have this mess. They did not do their job.
20 | Lisa Willis | 15 | 10154749364541336_10154749438796336 | The "Clinton Cartel" will get away with every scandal imaginable as long as they have a corrupt government and the crappy media backing them up!!!!!  js
21 | Dennis Newhouse | 20 | 10154749364541336_10154749430651336 | Clinton's don't play the same rules as us normal people!Usually someone else will get blamed and do any prison time!Drain the swamp!Start with the Clinton's! Then take the Obama's and Loretta Lynch!Their all apart of money laundering, fraud and other criminal crimes against the United States!
22 | Charley Helvy | 10 | 10154749364541336_10154749494531336 | As a retired military member that is my primary gripe among many against HRC. I will never vote for anyone who put service members lives in danger, risked s nsitive information, lied to everyone about it, got caught and got away Scott free with something that would have landed me in jail a very long time.  And that is just one controversy she is wrapped up in.
23 | Linda Lemos | 10 | 10154749364541336_10154749552226336 | That goes for many involved...how about DOJ head Loretta Lynch, James Comey, Huma Abedin...and more; are these people above the law because of their titles...what is this saying to the American people we have laws for certain group of society then we have laws for the rest of the citizenery!
24 | Bob Sullivan | 14 | 10154749364541336_10154749428046336 | I was in the Air Force for 24 years, worked Cheyenne Mountain for 18 months (most stressful job I have ever had) if someone worked with me did just 1 percent of what Hillary did, 10 years minimum and a BCD.
25 | Margarie Greenwell | 3 | 10154749364541336_1634615780170039 | Classified information on a unsecured server she should go to jail.she shouldn't be receiving classified briefings about American secrets.this soldier didn't do anything wrong that he knew, she knew what she was doing was wrong that showed intent
