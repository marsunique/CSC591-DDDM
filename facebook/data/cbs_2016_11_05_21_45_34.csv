3 | Aaron M. Norton | 37 | 10154046817900950_10154046827935950 | This is crazy. You might not like a candidate but you sure as hell aren't going to get away with trying to instill terror. Then again, could it be more rockstar type antics? A publicity stunt perhaps?
4 | Tino Mayo | 40 | 10154046817900950_10154046829500950 | Probably another one of those "tolerant" liberals. They are only tolerant so long as you agree with them, lick their boots and say Hillary should be anointed Queen and never questioned....Besides that they arent so tolerant.

He should tell the crowd to calm down and let law enforcement to take care of it.

5 | James Kuloloio | 36 | 10154046792950950_10154046810975950 | When Hillary had a loud and boisterous Trump supporter just steps from her she didn't run but  kept on with her speech.  One is confident while the other runs with his tail tucked between his legs.  Too funny!
6 | Barbara Ann Watson | 7 | 10154046792950950_10154046831215950 | I wish no harm to anyone but this is very suspicious to me. If there was a gun or a threat they would NOT allow him back out that quickly. I would not put it past the campaign that this was staged. At this point anything is possible.
7 | Joey Keenan | 39 | 10154046792950950_10154046797570950 | As bad as this election has been, I don't want to see anyone get hurt or worse.

20 | Cindy Lee | 0 | 10154046792950950_10154046859890950 | Trump displays the tell-tale signs of an authoritarian, signs which he observed firsthand in countries where authoritarian leaders had risen to power and usurped the liberties of the people. The parallels to Trump were troubling.Evan said that Trump‚Äôs tell-tale signs of authoritarianism included the following:Promising that he‚Äîand he alone‚Äîcan provide security to the nation (often later used as a justification to strip away the civil liberties of the people).Scapegoating minorities for the woes of the nation.Intimidating and attacking the press and voicing an intent to limit its freedom.Trying to rule by stirring up division based on race and religion.Advocating for a national ‚Äústop and frisk‚Äù policy for African-Americans.Voicing repeated admiration for authoritarian leaders throughout the world, including some of the most brutal dictators.

22 | Joyce Johnson | 0 | 10154046792950950_10154046843225950 | The following letter addressed to Donald Trump I am sharing with you was written by a lady on another page. She asked readers to share it... feel free to do so... My open letter to Trump supporters. I know it is long but please read and take a second to think about it. The future of this country depends on it. Feel free to share! So You Want Someone To ‚ÄòTell It Like It Is‚Äô? OK, Here You Go. 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin's puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals.3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade's cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said ‚Äú I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks.‚Äù Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person.4. You say you're patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution's limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin...etc5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton's history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can't ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional.8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem?9. I agree 100% if she's elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people‚Äôs money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home?11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin's little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right's anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country?12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said "Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,‚Äù and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillary's reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as "super-predators" in 1996? I don't agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don't care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.

11 | Claudio Torres | 7 | 10154046768745950_10154046788545950 | Even in the face of death, Trump supporters will talk about Trump instead of the people that solved the situation aka THE SECRET SERVICE
12 | Cody Carter | 28 | 10154046768745950_10154046771850950 | Nothing can stop the TRUMP TRAIN ... Not even the DNC who paid people $1,500 to disrupt his rallies violently.. Scumbag DNC
13 | Manuel Santiago | 2 | 10154046768745950_10154046833165950 | Complete BS fabricated by trump and his Republican liars. there was never a threat, never an issue, never anything... this was just made up to give him sympathy and make it seem people were trying to stop him. If there was a real threat against him they would have evacuated him from the venue, be on the plane and on their way back to trump tower in New York City, not letting him back on stage... This was BS.
14 | Kimberly Seman | 9 | 10154046768745950_10154046819270950 | Thank the Secret Service for protecting you and laying down their lives for you while you pay ZERO OF THEIR SALARIES BECAUSE YOU DO NOT PAY ANY TAXES. Entitled hypocrite.
15 | George Pales | 6 | 10154046768745950_10154046793775950 | Don't care for him, but threats to life will not be tolerated.  HIs hateful talk. Will no doubt cause more of this however!

Trump will sell us all out in a heart beat if he thinks it will save himself. Can you imagine if he pushes the nuke button? He will be hiding like a little bitch while we all burn.
18 | Lubna Arikat | 0 | 10154046768745950_10154046843955950 | Donald Trump staged fake assassination attempt to blame Hillary supporters & gain sympathy! This guy never runs out of BS & drama!

I am not saying that CBS is distributing malware or spyware, would not put it past them either...But fair is fair, this is the second post about it with no explanation and CBS might not even be aware....
22 | Carmen Mely Guzman | 11 | 10154046768745950_10154046782920950 | Chicken shit running, take it like a man, oh that's right he isn't a real man.
23 | Tommy Cook | 8 | 10154046768745950_10154046788530950 | LOL! Trump is SO desperate... A MAN WITH A GUN GOT THROUGH SECRET SERVICE? NO! Trump is grasping... He KNOWS he lost! What a fucking joke!!! The place would be put on LOCK DOWN! He walked back on stage after TWO MINUTES!!! LOL! I CALL BULLSHIT! FUCKING BULLSHIT!

It's not easy to believe someone who is always crying wolf. Supposedly a man with a gun, not confirmed. Uhmmm.....cry wolf.......
7 | Ed O'Farrell | 167 | 10154046757040950_10154046772340950 | a fight broke out in the audience between people who love Trump and those who love him more... Instead of standing pat, As Hillary has done in the past, Trump ran like a rabbit...

Thank God he has the guts to make true changes and make us all great again. Nobody deserves to be hurt or threatened period no matter who it is.
10 | Don Darkman | 242 | 10154046757040950_10154046769215950 | When Trump sends you his people.. He's not sending you his best people. He's sending white trash, rednecks, inbred hillbillies, kkk lovers, neo nazis...and some of them are good I guess??
11 | Michelle Fitchett | 71 | 10154046757040950_10154046776170950 | Why do people have to be so stupid. I hope trump is ok. If you don't like trump that is your choice but no one has the right to hurt anyone

14 | Kristen Miller Cirigliano | 21 | 10154046757040950_1209897415740106 | Wow. Some of the comments on here reflect only what YOU have in your own twisted head that you wish to project upon Trump and his supporters. Truly disgusting. Thank God he's okay, and back out there delivering his message.
15 | Traci Cape | 55 | 10154046757040950_10154046784980950 | Bunch of morons commenting. He was grabbed and rushed off stage... People will turn anything around even when its in front of them. Would it be funny if it was Obama? People have no respect for life.

She's already sold so many military secrets and put us in harm's way and will weaken the military and strip us of our second amendment right. After that we won't be able to defend ourselves and the rest of our rights are GONE! She is fighting for control Trump is fighting for the nation.
21 | LaShona Chera | 22 | 10154046757040950_10154046788135950 | Wow what happened?? I don't like this man at all but I don't wish harm on him. I do believe if he becomes the President, someone will try to kill him. He will probably need alot more security than any other president in office

25 | Lara Ann Notes | 0 | 10154046717095950_10154046741030950 | We've had 8 years of a "Historic President" that hasn't been able to work across the isle because it's his way or the highway. He hasn't accomplished much, and things he has done he's used tricks to accomplish and those "accomplishments" have severely damaged this country (ObamaCare, amnesty, etc). Enter Hillary, who wants to be  the next "Historic President", who Obama endorses and campaigns for, saying her election is about HIS legacy. This only supports what Clinton has been saying - she will be Obama's third term. Another 4 years of not working with people, not negotiating, of using tricks to get thing done. We can't afford back to back failing historic presidents. But Clinton will be even less effective than Obama, because not even Obama was the subject of three FBI investigations when entering office. And we all know the drip of bad news about Clinton wont stop if she's elected. So, there is no way she can be an effective president. Acting like Obama, and then being shackled by her own drama, will make the WH a laughing stock worse than when Bill was impeached. She will never be trusted as president - by our government or others. I mean, can you imagine a situation where Clinton pardons herself?  We don't need that folks. We can't afford that folks. We need to make some real progress - real change.  Clinton can't give that to us. The third party candidates can't give that to us. Like it or not, that only leaves one candidate - Trump. You may vote for him grudgingly, as I did, but he's the only real choice and chance for this country to make progress that matters. I voted Trump / Pence. And not that anyone cares, but I'm white with a BBA in CIS and an MBA in Marketing. I am an informed voter.

10 | Bill McKetrick | 20 | 10154046698135950_10154046712205950 | Sorry Donald‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but, the only person running for President who is actually under indictment, is YOU !!To recap, Donald Trump will go on trial in November for racketeering, and again in December accused of child rape. He is a sexual predator, hasn‚Äôt released his tax returns, and has used money from his charitable foundation to pay his legal fees and bribe a state Attorney General not to pursue charges against him. He has abused the family of a war hero, and openly mocked women and a disabled reporter‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..but, let‚Äôs instead talk about some emails Hillary didn‚Äôt send, that are on someone else‚Äôs computer‚Ä¶..that weren‚Äôt a crime anyway. But, you know what‚Ä¶‚Ä¶? Even if Hillary Clinton was trading oral sex and state secrets in the back seat of a stolen Subaru for crack cocaine in a 7-11 parking lot in the Middle East that doubles as an illegal abortion clinic‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I would still vote for her over ‚ÄòDonnie Douchbag‚Äô !!

1 | Kim Williams | 129 | 10154046687175950_10154046690165950 | So let's get this straight, the wife of a sexting pedophile works as the right hand person of the wife of a rapist. Both wives have a long history of standing behind their mans actions. One wife actually defended a pedophile rapist and set a guilty man free, destroyed the victims of her husband‚Äôs sexual assaults, And her campaign cries for women's rights? You got to be joking...
2 | Joe Goodman | 30 | 10154046687175950_10154046689065950 | For all the negative things the Trumpetts say/think about Hillary.......it must really irk you Trump supporters that your candidate sucks sooooooo much, that he can't even beat her. :-) :-)

4 | Chris Holly | 16 | 10154046687175950_10154046705220950 | the dumbing down of America continues - if you want to vote for a woman this year vote Jill Stein, she's a better role model for your daughters than Hillary Clinton.

"In 1972, Shirley Chisholm became the first major-party black candidate for President of the United States, and the first woman ever to run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination""Jill Stein was on the presidential ballot in 2012 and is the presidential candidate of the Green Party for 2016."https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_female_United_States_presidential_and_vice-presidential_candidatesSomebody please read and research.

12 | Gregory Uccello | 0 | 10154046687175950_10154046719165950 | I have a different way of thinking, and I see manipulation and distraction, as well as negative, I feel.the clintons and Obama's are manipulators as well as the democratic party, I personally am am independent, we need to think clearly and not fall for the insults that the democratic party and many of the media to insult our intellect, by acting like a victim.  THEY do not care about us,.all they want is TO stay in power.  All these distractions and negatives toward trump is actually them being negative and manipulating us to get emotional.  The :nasty woman: comment, if you actually watched the contact was when hillary made a flippant remark about Trump, attempting to avoid taxes, which, is Hillary's way of being rude, since she is passive aggressive, do the party spins it as if he meant all woman. Sometimes we gotta use out brain and consider context. Not just trust the media and commercials spinning things. trump is not an actor or politician, basically an actor, since most speeches are written out for them by professionals.  Do lets ignore the drama! And not let these people avoid the issues and go personal.  Lets not forget Obama said very simular negatives as Trump and bernie has since 2008. Because this whole election is just a bad reality show, choreographed by the democratic party since they control most of the entertainment business as well... Be smart... Think deeper...

LOL
15 | Linda Kellstrom | 1 | 10154046687175950_10154046745125950 | By Summer Marie - I really hope you do not become the first female president.I write this not because I am some crazy, right-wing, anti-feminist conspirator; I hope you are not our first female president because it would be a disgrace to that title and a disgrace to all of the young women in our country who aspire to actually do some good for our nation.Many people believe you are the best candidate for the position because you have been doing this political thing for a while‚Äîbut when was the last time that you were able to relate to the common American?You grew up in the rich white suburbs of Chicago as a young child and attended Yale. You then went on to ride Bill‚Äôs coattails all the way to your Senate seat as a former First Lady. Any true feminist would look at you and see that you are a fraud.You get on your soapbox and claim that every woman who is a victim of sexual assault should be heard‚Äîbut what about Juanita Broaddrick? Carolyn Moffet? Paula Corbin? Sara Allen-James? Christy Zercher? Kathleen Willey? Monica Lewinsky? All women who were sexually harassed or exploited by your husband.Yet you stand by him continuously, defending him and helping clean up his messes. If you ask me, that‚Äôs not very appealing to me as a woman. You also stood by him after he openly admitted to having ‚Äúsexual relations‚Äù with Monica. That sounds like a very conservative stand by my man move if you ask me.If you were as independent as you portray yourself to be, why didn‚Äôt you just leave Bill? Because you needed his political access to get your foot in the door.All of that aside, the sheer fact that you allowed four Americans to perish in Benghazi and then proceeded to later ask, ‚Äúwhat difference does it make?‚Äù proves to me that you don‚Äôt care about American lives. Those were four American men who died. Four families in our country that suffered a loss. Four mothers that had to bury their sons.‚ÄúWhat difference does it make?‚Äù‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs not just a detail if it‚Äôs your kid, if it‚Äôs your family. It‚Äôs a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president, too.‚ÄùA detail to you, former Secretary‚Äîbut to those families, a huge difference.Not to mention you want to allow all of these refugees in. Don‚Äôt get me wrong: I am a humanitarian. However, I, as an American citizen, am guaranteed safety as well as the safety of my future children and grandchildren in the Preamble of the Constitution of the United States.The one thing, if nothing else, that you as someone running for President of the United States should uphold. I understand that we should help people, but at the end of the day, would Syria do the same for us? In our time of crisis it is our job first and foremost, and yours, to ensure our own citizen‚Äôs safety.You use your platform of charitable humanitarian but now we are learning the extent to which your foundation is a fraud. It‚Äôs nothing but a money-laundering business that you can catch a tax break from.Which, by the way, is a wee bit illegal.You took up monetary donations after the Haiti earthquake and, yes, you did build a textile factory‚Äîon the opposite side of Haiti that wasn‚Äôt even affected by the earthquake. You also conveniently signed off Uranium to be given to Russia just after Uranium One shareholders deposited $145 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. How thoughtful of them.You also claim to be against big business and fight all the big bad business bullies, but you‚Äôre in bed with them!Your daughter is, too. Your daughter married a former investor for Goldman Sachs. Your family managed to help spend some odd $3 million on their wedding. Wonder where that money really came from.You claim to be a friend of the black community and that you‚Äôre going to help bring them out of poverty. Look around! You are a part of the administration that has left them where they are and you have no intentions of changing that. You want control. Your mentor Saul Alinsky taught you that.You don‚Äôt know any struggle or strife. You are the epitome of ‚Äúwhite privilege.‚Äù You traipse around in heinous $12,000 suits and preach about how you are for the people‚Äîhow you are going to pull them out of poverty as you attend events where you give 20-minute speeches to the tune of $500,000 and eat $800 plates of food on your private plane.You have never faced financial strife. What makes you think you can help fix our national debt crisis?Above all things, if nothing else, the reason why I hope you don‚Äôt become the first female president is because you are a criminal. It does not matter if you didn‚Äôt intentionally use a server that was not secure. I may not intentionally go 55 in a 40 but the police officer is going to give me a ticket. I may not intentionally kill someone in a car accident; however, I can still go down for manslaughter. People don‚Äôt intentionally become drug addicts but you bet they still end up in prison for possession.You think you are above the law. You manipulate the system, which is not what a leader does. It‚Äôs not right.I am not some right-wing conspiracy theorist lunatic. I simply look at the facts.These facts tell me that I wouldn‚Äôt let you look after my pet rock, much less this nation.

17 | Maria Perez | 2 | 10154046687175950_10154046751760950 | I was asked how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste from a fellow deplorable Trumpian.

1 | Israel Oren | 0 | 10154046680100950_10154046773195950 | Obama said your health insurance will save you $2,500 through Obamacare. He was right, you know. Let's do the math.A person that once paid $385 a month now pays 789$ a month. As per the new rates, you will pay $1824 a month. Can't pay it? OK, pay the fine, that comes out to $2175. So if you were paying $385 a month, that's $4296 a year.So $4296 - $2175 = $2121 savings.Get it?
2 | Kelly Duffy Sage | 11 | 10154046680100950_10154046700410950 | Obama spent 9 TRILLION dollars for this anemic recovery, 9 Trillion without rebuilding our infrastructure, without taking care of our American Hero's, while depleting our military, destroying our decent health care, to make way for single payer, socialized medicine, while lying to us about it, our first african american president left his brothers and sisters to suffer in the inner cities without relief, and with the help of Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, created Chaos and death in the middle east, in Libya, in Syria, and allowed ISIS to rise in Iraq, the death toll is in the hundreds of thousands, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, and they call it a success.The United states is closer to war with Russia than we have been since the cold war, the Philippines, our protectorate and friend for generations has cut ties with us and is looking to join with china and russia, north Korea is launching medium range ballistic missiles into the south china sea, China has stolen our stealth technology and is using it to build their war machines, That is just the tip of the iceberg, we wont find out in truth, for decades, how much damage they have done, to this great nation.It is time for a change, Go Trump.

25 | Henrik Ahlm | 0 | 10154046680100950_10154046761070950 | Trump is scared shitless if he becomes President.  So much in fact that he wears a diaper when in public.Talking with his communication advisor on the phone I said I knew all along that he really never wanted to be President.A bit later the same day Trump was briefly on the line saying in a very tired soft voice "Mr. Ahlm thank, thank you so much!" He was very emotional so in order to calm him down I explained that he should vote for Hillary on Tuesday cause people from the future have of course already analyzied the outcome. Once again he uttered "Thank you, oh thank you Mr. Ahlm.Fact is that Hillary will become the 45th President of the United States of America and America will slowly but surely regain her greatness. God bless.

1 | Judy Kay | 8 | 10154046631060950_10154046655735950 | Network Blackout of Report of Likely Clinton Foundation Indictment Is Beyond the PaleBy Michael W. Chapman | November 3, 2016 | MRC President L. Brent Bozell III. Commenting on the fact that at least two FBI sources have disclosed that a criminal indictment of the Clinton Foundation is likely and yet the networks ABC, CBS, and NBC are not reporting this news confirms there is a "media cover-up," a network "blackout," said Media Research Center Brent Bozell in a statement on Thursday.‚ÄúThe networks‚Äô blackout of the news that two FBI sources said there will ‚Äòlikely‚Äô be indictments related to the Clinton Foundation is beyond the pale," said Bozell."If there was a report about likely indictments related to the Trump Foundation, there would be an immediate flash mob of reporters camped in front of Trump Tower breaking away from regularly scheduled programming and offering play-by-play commentary," he said.  "No one in the so-called ‚Äònews‚Äô media can deny this without lying through his/her teeth," said Bozell, whose media watchdog group has been documenting, exposing, and neutralizing liberal media bias for 29-plus years."The stench of corruption between the Justice Department, the State Department and the Clinton Foundation machine and now the leftist ‚Äònews‚Äô media is overpowering," he said.  "This is a media cover-up."

7 | Ronnie Pecinovsky | 9 | 10154046631060950_10154046640225950 | AMERICANS it is like a CORPORATE SELL OFF. America has become a country of consumers. I drive an AMERICAN brand car...made in MEXICO...my shirt made in EGYPT, my pants from CHINA, my underwear from JAPAN!! BUT ALL AMERICAN BRANDS. If I actually wore ALL'AMERICAN...I would be naked!!! Because only myself is fully made in AMERICA. ARE YOU MAD?NOW YOU NEED TO KNOW WHY. Politicians have sold America to other countries, NAFTA, TPP, other trade deals have made some politicians filthy rich and Americans poor. Chinese steel...NOT AMERICAN STEEL...builds todays sky scrapers,  Amercan acreage for food is sold to foreign investment groups, AMERICAN COMPANIES WILL NOT PAY AMERICAN WAGES TO REAL AMERICAN WORKERS BUT instead sell out employees to MOVE THE ENTIRE BUSINESS TO A FOREIGN NATION FOR 15% ON THE DOLLAR PROFIT!!! INSTEAD OF BUILDING A NEW FACTORY HERE they are about to leave families without income to have to rely on government agencies for assistance. SO IF THAT IS NOT UN-AMERICAN ...THEN WHAT IS? Are you mad yet? ARE YOU MAD YET?1/3 of AMERICANS are out of work! NOT 5% like OBAMA likes to tell you. 90 million AMERICANS have given up on finding a job! That statistic does not change because it looks nice on a piece of paper...REAL PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING STILL AND ARE DESPARATE TO WORK!!! It is the giving up part that makes me mad. The OBAMA ADMINISTRATION did this...not TRUMP HUMPING WOMEN OR SAYING BAD WORDS...AND CERTAINLY NOT HAVING TO NOT PAY TAXES BECAUSE HE IS SMART ENOUGH TO USE THE TAX CODES TO SAVE BILLIONS!!! OBAMA AND HIS POLICIES THAT HILLARY CLINTON ENDORSES HAVE CAUSED THE PROBLEMS AMERICA IS IN...SELLING AMERICA IN PIECES BECAUSE IT IS WORTH MORE THAN AS A WHOLE NATION!! EVERYTHING ELSE IS CRAP!!! ARE YOU MAD YET? ARE YOU MAD...YET?So until politicians, policy, and government change and quit selling AMERICAS IDENTITY for profit...THIS NATIONAL DISGRACE WILL CONTINUE IN A CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. Public servants selling democracy, influence and making our political system a FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION for the political elite...this corporate sell off of AMERICA for the benefit of the FEW will continue. ARE YOU MAD YET? ARE YOU MAD...YET?SOME PATRIOTS BELIEVE A NATION AS A WHOLE IS WORTH MORE THAN SELLING IT OFF INTO PIECES.THERE IS A MOVEMENT...IT WAS STARTED BY THE PEOPLE...EMBRACED BY ONE and only one person, GROWN TO ENRAGE A NATION, AND WILL NOT STOP, UNTIL GOVERNMENT, POLITICIANS, MEDIA, AND THE ENTIRE WORLD LISTENS!!!AMERICANS WANT OUR NATION, OUR HERITAGE, AND OUR FUTURE FIRST!!! AND DAMNIT TO HELL...WE DO NOT CARE...IF IT IS...POLITICALLY CORRECT!!! ARE YOU MAD YET? ARE YOU MAD...YET?I AM VOTING DONALD TRUMP not because he is without faults... I AM VOTING BECAUSE HE HAS HIS FAULTS...BUT LOVES MY COUNTRY BEYOND OUR COUNTRIES...FAULTS!!!VOTE FOR CHANGE!! BECAUSE YOU ARE MAD ...NOW!!!

This computer was found to have top secrete US information, which has been hacked into by no less then five different foreign intelligence agencies, putting America in jeopardy for a terrorist attack. "FBI Sources say,an indictment is more than likely for Hillary Clinton".#5 Fact: 675,000 additional US emails have been found on the computer of Huma Abedin's huband Anthony Weiner.Anthony is currently under an FBI investigation for sexting under aged girls. Leaked information also reveals that Hillary Clinton and Huma both knew of his illegal behaviors for (over 5 years) and did nothing to stop him.#6 Fact: The Clinton Foundation is also under an FBI investigation for money laundering & fraud as well as several other felony charges.#7 Fact: Hillary Clinton's campaign & The Clinton Foundation have been receiving 10's of thousand's of dollar from the very same foreign leaders who funded the Sept 11th attack America.#8 Fact: Hillary Clinton supports late term/partial birth abortion. For those who do not know what that means I will explain: Late term/partial birth abortion means should a female change her mind about giving birth (for any reason) at (any point of her pregnancy) she can have what is called a partial birth abortion. This act results in delivering the child just far enough that the base of the head is exposed. Then surgical scissors are rammed into the back of the neck, cutting into the spinal cord. The scissors are then opened to cut the spinal cord completely, this resulting in the death of a baby that could in fact live outside the womb.#9 Fact: In leaked emails it has been found that several members of the Clinton campaign has mocked the idea that "conservative Catholics would have their children baptized in the same river where John the Baptist baptized Jesus," They have also said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an amazing bastardization of the faith., that Catholics must be attracted to the systematic thought and severely backwards gender relations and must be totally unaware of Christian democracy.‚ÄùHilary Clinton herself has said, " Christians must deny their Faith through the enforcement of laws, by stating that the Christian belief in being pro-life, and anti-abortion, must change, and that this should be done through laws and ‚Äúpolitical will.‚Äù#10 Fact: Leaked emails have proven that some of the mainstream media news stations have been colluding with the Clinton campaign and in fact have been reporting untrue story about Donald Trump.(CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC just to name a few)#11 Fact: There's a undercover video going around shows that Hillary Clinton & the DNC has paid off thugs to cause riots at Trump rallies, paying the protester cash money as well as a new cellphone.#12 Fact: President Obama has not only lied to America about knowing that Hillary Clinton had an unprotected server but he is also working overtime to protect her from being properly prosecuted for no other reason but to preserve his presidential legacy.#13 Fact: Hillary Clinton has signed over 20% percent of America‚Äôs uranium to Russia.**Uranium is used to make atoms bombs**#14 Fact: Hillary Clinton had to return $200,000 worth of furniture, china and artwork she had taken from The White House National Archives that never belonged to her.#15 Fact: Leaked emails show that the top campaign staff of Hillary Clinton has called Hispanic American's "Needy Latino & The Taco Bowl Vote", yet Hillary refuses to denounce theses comments and continues to have theses top campaign staffers on her payroll.#16 Fact: Leaked Emails prove that Hillary Clinton was given the questions in advance for two different debates by the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee Donna Brazile, who just so happened to also be a paid employee of CNN at the time.#17 Fact: Hillary Clinton wants a ‚Äò500% Increase of Syrian Refugees‚Äô to inter America, after top Military Advisers warn that ISIS will in fact infiltrate the Syrian Refugees population and there is no way to have them properly vetted, therefor America is in great danger of a massive attack. "Not a matter of (if) but it's a matter of (when)#18 Fact: Leaked emails shows that U.S. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs "Peter Kadzik" gave Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign a ‚Äúheads up‚Äù about what would be discussed during the oversight hearing on Clinton‚Äôs email scandal.** This is yet another illegal act**#19 Fact: Hillary Clinton has deleted 33,000 emails, she had least 13 phones smashed with hammers and her unprotected computer server had BleachBit software used on it to prevent recovery of files requested by The House Select Committee on the Benghazi attack.#20 Fact: Out of billions of dollars collected by The Clinton Foundation over the years, only a very small percent goes to charity.Meanwhile Clinton's & their friends are receiving high payments for their jobs within the foundation.Our former president Bill Clinton as well as Hillary Clinton, were heavily involved in distributing Haiti earthquake reconstruction funds,Yet years later, news reports reveal that a large number of Haitians still live in deplorable, shanty town, tented cities and an ongoing epidemic of cholera has claimed thousands of lives.Dear Fellow American's,Yes you are in fact possessively, absolutely entitled to our own opinions regarding who you wish to vote for in this or any other election and I am (not) in any way shape or form trying to "demand" for you or any one else to vote a certain way.** Particularly to just appease my own out coming**However, with that said I can not begin to tell you just how truly (shocked) I am to learn that so many American's are unwilling to seek the (facts) regarding this "Historical Election".An election that (will) change the direction of America for the next 30 to 50 years.My words can not begin to convey to you just how sadden I am to learn that so many are willing to cast a vote for a woman who has had a (long history) of evil & questionable behaviors, as the above list is just a very small example of who is she truly is and what she has been known to surround herself with.**A quote from Hillary Clinton**"When Someone Shows You Who They Are, Believe Them".„ÄÄ <3 May God continue to Bless America <3

So much in fact that he wears a diaper when in public.Talking with his communication advisor on the phone I said I knew all along that he really never wanted to be President.A bit later the same day Trump was briefly on the line saying in a very tired soft voice "Mr. Ahlm thank, thank you so much!" He was very emotional so in order to calm him down I explained that he should vote for Hillary on Tuesday cause people from the future have of course already analyzied the outcome. Once again he uttered "Thank you, oh thank you Mr. Ahlm.Fact is that Hillary will become the 45th President of the United States of America and America will slowly but surely regain her greatness. God bless.

Anthony Weiner was spotted riding a horse at a rehab facility that offers equine therapy for sex addiction.

So i hope riding the horse helps those missing moments he will not see for awhile, until he get's his life together and move on. Say a prayer people, he needs it!

19 | Guerrero Espiritual | 0 | 10154046289705950_10154046302645950 | BREAKING: Comey Mandates All FBI Agents Report to D.C. Offices; Prep for Raids, Possible Arrests in Clinton ProbesPosted on November 4, 2016 by adminFBI Director James Comey issued a mandate late Thursday instructing all available special agents from the Washington D.C. field office and Hoover Building headquarters to report to work immediately, federal law enforcement sources told True Pundit.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre preparing for many arrests from the top down,‚Äù the FBI source said. ‚ÄúI cannot elaborate beyond that.‚ÄùWhen pressed to better define what ‚Äúfrom the top down‚Äù meant in terms of possible suspects, the source refused to elaborate.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a smart guy; read between the lines,‚Äù the source said.Based on case protocol, the FBI is either preparing to conduct sweeping search warrants in the Clinton Foundation investigation or ready to start arresting suspects. Or both. If a grand jury has been convened by the Justice Department since Comey‚Äôs decision to re-open the Hillary Clinton case last week, then the FBI could make arrests if indictments were handed down by Thursday (yesterday). If not, it is more likely FBI agents are being amassed for multiple simultaneous raids on suspects‚Äô homes and businesses to secure warrant-backed evidence.Will search warrants be served on Friday? Based on FBI protocol, Friday raids are unorthodox in cases not involving kidnappings or investigations where human lives are at risk. Preparation for wide-scale raids can take 48 hours or more, depending on how many targets are in play.The Clinton investigation has reached a fever pitch this week fueled by alarming new allegations first unveiled on Wednesday by True Pundit. New revelations from newly-recovered Clinton emails, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources linked to the probe said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to:Money launderingChild exploitationSex crimes with minors (children)PerjuryPay to play through Clinton FoundationObstruction of justiceOther felony crimesDocuments and emails released late Thursday by Wikileaks substantiated certain allegations of child exploitation linked to the Clinton Foundation; with Hillary as secretary of state and President Bill Clinton acting as a United Nation‚Äôs special envoy to Haiti after its devastating 2010 earthquake.

I drive an AMERICAN brand car...made in MEXICO...my shirt made in EGYPT, my pants from CHINA, my underwear from JAPAN!! BUT ALL AMERICAN BRANDS. If I actually wore ALL'AMERICAN...I would be naked!!! Because only myself is fully made in AMERICA. ARE YOU MAD?NOW YOU NEED TO KNOW WHY. Politicians have sold America to other countries, NAFTA, TPP, other trade deals have made some politicians filthy rich and Americans poor. Chinese steel...NOT AMERICAN STEEL...builds todays sky scrapers,  Amercan acreage for food is sold to foreign investment groups, AMERICAN COMPANIES WILL NOT PAY AMERICAN WAGES TO REAL AMERICAN WORKERS BUT instead sell out employees to MOVE THE ENTIRE BUSINESS TO A FOREIGN NATION FOR 15% ON THE DOLLAR PROFIT!!! INSTEAD OF BUILDING A NEW FACTORY HERE they are about to leave families without income to have to rely on government agencies for assistance. SO IF THAT IS NOT UN-AMERICAN ...THEN WHAT IS? Are you mad yet? ARE YOU MAD YET?1/3 of AMERICANS are out of work! NOT 5% like OBAMA likes to tell you. 90 million AMERICANS have given up on finding a job! That statistic does not change because it looks nice on a piece of paper...REAL PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING STILL AND ARE DESPARATE TO WORK!!! It is the giving up part that makes me mad. The OBAMA ADMINISTRATION did this...not TRUMP HUMPING WOMEN OR SAYING BAD WORDS...AND CERTAINLY NOT HAVING TO NOT PAY TAXES BECAUSE HE IS SMART ENOUGH TO USE THE TAX CODES TO SAVE BILLIONS!!! OBAMA AND HIS POLICIES THAT HILLARY CLINTON ENDORSES HAVE CAUSED THE PROBLEMS AMERICA IS IN...EVERYTHING ELSE IS CRAP!!! ARE YOU MAD YET? ARE YOU MAD...YET?So until politicians, policy, and government change and quit selling AMERICAS IDENTITY for profit...THIS NATIONAL DISGRACE WILL CONTINUE IN A CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. Public servants selling democracy, influence and making our political system a FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION for the political elite...this corporate sell off of AMERICA for the benefit of the FEW will continue. ARE YOU MAD YET? ARE YOU MAD...YET?THERE IS A MOVEMENT...IT WAS STARTED BY THE PEOPLE...EMBRACED BY ONE and only one person, GROWN TO ENRAGE A NATION, AND WILL NOT STOP, UNTIL GOVERNMENT, POLITICIANS, MEDIA, AND THE ENTIRE WORLD LISTENS!!!AMERICANS WANT OUR NATION, OUR HERITAGE, AND OUR FUTURE FIRST!!! AND DAMNIT TO HELL...WE DO NOT CARE...IF IT IS...POLITICALLY CORRECT!!! ARE YOU MAD YET? ARE YOU MAD...YET?I AM VOTING DONALD TRUMP not because he is without faults... I AM VOTING BECAUSE HE HAS HIS FAULTS...BUT LOVES MY COUNTRY BEYOND OUR COUNTRIES...FAULTS!!!VOTE FOR CHANGE!! BECAUSE YOU ARE MAD ...NOW!!!

Just like she supports TPP! NAFTA has enabled thousands of companies to leave this country and with them our good paying jobs and avoid paying taxes, and then bring their products back into this country without paying taxes! These companies are not paying taxes, their fired employees are not paying taxes other jobs and companies that were generated from them are gone and are not paying taxes! We are talking Trillions and Trillions of taxes not paid here anymore! Sounds like the national debt don't it? hil-liar-y will raise big business taxes, which will only cause big businesses to run from this country! Then who will be left to pay taxes? Us,We, You, I...

It is so embarrassing, as a woman, to think persons would want her as a role model, let alone, the leader of this nation.  Her daughter should feel disgraced to have these 2 people, her parents.

And they want to complain about their staffers and their laptops? They probably want them back because they have e-mails on them that the FBI are looking for.

Like great they saved that kitten do you really think that's the first time she did that? What about the other kittens! A stray cat problem is not an excuse for letting an abuser get off free
2 | Jen Dopson | 51 | 10154046134530950_10154046154340950 | Not having her charged was so totally the wrong thing to do. They are just as guilty, claiming "well we have a stray cat problem ". Sickening.

As American hispanics, we are tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the fantastic Trump Strong t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/trumpstrong .And let's Make America Great Again! Thank you.

There‚Äôs a path to victory for either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, though just a few days out from the election, Trump‚Äôs path is more difficult than Clinton‚Äôs.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Gregg C Jones | 61 | 10154046008275950_10154046024485950 | CBS,,,, Trump's path is more difficult?  Yesterday was Walter Cronkite's 100th anniversary. He was voted the "Most Trusted Man in America". You will never have anyone win that title again. If Trump wins, AND as you say his path is more difficult, then you all the stuff you have smeared him with will not have worked despite your "best efforts"
2 | Steve Barkowsky | 35 | 10154046008275950_10154046029055950 | Congratulations, CBS.  Perhaps you have suppressed enough Trump votes with your phony polls and never-ending 24/7 negative Trump stories to give Hillary the victory.  What do you get out of it?
3 | Cheri K Campbell | 20 | 10154046008275950_10154046043710950 | Come on CBS we know he has the most difficult task. Republicans always do!! But he sure has you all scurrying around to get her elected! He has a dedicated movement not a I deserve this position attitude like Hillary! Trump has actually showed that he will work FOR the people!
4 | Jack Rougeaux | 12 | 10154046008275950_10154046043790950 | Finally CBS gets something right. The path to winning the election is much harder for Donald Trump thanks to the gutless Republican establishment that's more concerned with being politically correct then winning the election.Then the news media with their anti-Trump propaganda plus all the lies from the liberal Democrats and yes some of Trump's own statements. But the finish line is coming up an he's in the running.
5 | Eric Douglas Jr. | 0 | 10154046008275950_10154046133950950 | I haven't heard Mrs Clinton or Mr trump talk about education. And even if they have its been a small part of this whole thing, I don't even remember seeing anything on the ballots about education maybe I should go check again. Everything about this election is about emails, sexual assault, allegations taxes, and race. It's sickening and quite frankly I'm tired of hearing about it.
6 | Peter Geedman | 6 | 10154046008275950_10154046043160950 | How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.  I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"By Bill Snow Jr.

14 | David Halahmy | 2 | 10154046008275950_10154046126500950 | In just a few days our nation will take a another step back. Regardless of who is our next president. We have endured 8 years of rising debt (from 10 -20 trillion), growing Islamic radicalism, massive increases to our heath care and sadly a more divided nation then I have ever seen in my life. And neither of the two folks who will be sitting in the white house will do much about those issues. But I still have hope that one day our nation will find its path again. Neither Hilary or Trump will make your life better. That is up to you. I suggest a heavy dose of individual responsibility for the next stage of American History. If you work hard, be a good husband, wife, neighbor you will hopefully stay on your feet. It will be a historic day, we will elect a reality t.v. star celebrity to be president, or a person under FBI investigation who should be indicted.

You call this qualified? Clinton cannot follow basic laws. A lifetime of controversy. Distorted so called Trump's issues are petty compared to Clinton's actions. Clinton has become a multi millionaire through unethical, shady, and maybe illegal means.Trump has become a multi billionaire through ethical and legal means. (any significant wrong doing or finding against Trump would be front page news 24/7. Most of the minor accusations of wrong doing are false, spun or made up, or settled. Anti Trump people are desperate for dirt). Trump, a Global Business Leader (whether you have an appreciation for what that is or not) has a history of mostly success. Clinton, a career politician has a history of mostly failure. I look at accomplishments and performance, not rhetoric. Business leaders compete daily. Politicians compete at election time. Seek truth. The self serving government cartel needs to end. Our country is desperate for a real leader that will serve the people.

"So, he used every word in the book. I won‚Äôt even use the initials because I‚Äôll get in trouble,‚Äù Trump said of Jay Z's language at the Clinton rally.

2 | Teri Easton | 121 | 10154045927510950_10154045968665950 | Trump complains about language when I heard the chanting at his rallies, as he cheered them on, saying about Clinton,  "f*** that C**t" and now little Donny is offended. Oh my, stop the presses.
3 | Alan Faulkner | 40 | 10154045927510950_10154046048905950 | Don't worry about Donald Trump winning Nevada because with 70%of all votes being cast during early voting it's been reported on local tv that Donald Trump and the Republicans will loose Nevada,so now we have to hope the rest of America follows in our foot steps and keep Donald Trump out of the WHITE H.OUSE.

6 | Philip Cross | 78 | 10154045927510950_10154045944660950 | Beyonc√© shakes her ass, shows her boobies, and JayZ is as foul-mouthed as ever but the Democrats think that loose women, foul mouthed racist singing boys are okay at a Hillary event - but they think locker room language is "bad"
7 | Raymond Lavine | 30 | 10154045927510950_10154045958630950 | Elections are about policy. The Don talks about other people's words. Review the language and ideas of the Don. I do not read valid ideas where America will be better with him as president.
8 | Mike Blanchard | 24 | 10154045927510950_10154045969620950 | Almost, every thing Trump has been saying reminds me of high school, when I learned more about someone saying some of the same things,, his name was Hitler,, think about it!
9 | Kelly Duffy Sage | 45 | 10154045927510950_10154045935060950 | Someone asked me how could I support Trump, a ‚Äúmisogynist, a racist and a bigot‚Äù.Here is why...Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think. Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist. Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.Because the Obama/Hillary regime have pissed up countries like China and Russia and thanks to their incompetence we are closer than never before to a global confrontation which could likely lead to nuclear war. Meanwhile Trump wants to work with Russia and find compromise unlike Obama and Hillary who stupidly and foolishly believe that they can bully Russia into submission..Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist. Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right. Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe? Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers. Because I fear for my family‚Äôs safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues ‚Äì which is a threat to our way of life. Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them. Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it. Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries. Because, unlike Hillary, he has actually created jobs, worked hard and achieved success. And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.

5 | Patricia Jeffries | 7 | 10154045866790950_10154045875620950 | WE BETTER REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT THIS ELECTION IS RIGHT NOW OR "HILLARY CLINTON WILL DRAG US INTO A WAR WITH RUSSIA THAT WILL COST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES.Hillary Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama are the founders of ISIS.Clinton and Obama did not just create ISIS, they micro-managed them for years. This was part of their master plan in 2012, and they are now being exposed for it.In a WikiLeaks email, a memo was created by Obama‚Äôs top military advisers that made its way to all of our federal agencies, including Hillary Clinton at the State DepartmentTheir Hidden Agenda Is Now Being ExposedHillary and Obama were well aware that ISIS was forming and they knew exactly where they wanted to take control‚Äìso why did they not eliminate this terrorist group right then and there?Obama and Hillary are both globalists that dream of a hemispheric common market, with open borders and open trade. In order to accomplish their goal of doing so, they needed a major player to do the dirty work for them. That is why they allowed ISIS to form, metastasize, grow, and take control of the Middle East.Obama and Hillary‚Äôs Globalist Dictatorship RevealedOn top of allowing ISIS to wreck havoc, they needed someone very wealthy to finance the operation and push the agenda in a way that could not be traced back to either of them and the United States government. That is where George Soros comes into play.Soros, a wealthy crony, has long financed open borders, global agendas, silencing the people, and dictators. This master-plan plays perfectly into what he has been wanting to do for years.In this video, breaks down all of the documents and emails, proving that not only did Obama and Hillary create ISIS, they did it deliberately in a way that would allow them to remain in power.By allowing ISIS to remain a major force in the Middle East, it gives the United States power to dictate terms with neighboring nations. Furthermore, it also allows the refugee crisis to occur, which gives the United States direct control of policy decisions in European countries.In order for Obama and Hillary to carry out their globalist agenda, they needed three things to happen.First, they needed to establish partnerships and deals with all Muslim nations (claiming to be) fighting ISIS. This is where massive cases of quid-pro-quo came into play.While Secretary of State, Hillary approved massive weapon deals to Muslim nations, that also fund terrorism, in exchange for millions of dollars into her own pockets.When Hillary supplied nations like Saudi Arabia and many others with weapons, she knew they would filter them down to ISIS, and that is exactly what happened. While Hillary supplied ISIS, she also found a way to collect more than $100,000,000 in ‚Äúdonations‚Äù from these terrorist nations.Why else would they be donating this much money to her? It was ‚Äúhush‚Äù money.Second, the United States needed to create an ‚Äúexplosion,‚Äù of sorts, in the Middle East that would expand the chaos into other nations.When the refugee crisis occurred, it gave Obama and Hillary the perfect way to profit more and expand their agenda even further in early 2015They Now Have Many Partners In Their Master PlanWhile Obama and Hillary allowed ISIS to expand into Europe, they knew that it would ruin weaker Nations. The fear of terrorism has taken over Europe while Islam is running rampant has forced weaker nations in asking the United States for help. That has allowed the United States to step in and meddle wherever the choose now.With that, we have our third point.There is only one country not listed above that poses the biggest threat to the United States: Russia.As all of this unfolded, Russia was the only world power that stood up and challenged the Clinton/Obama agenda.Take note of what Obama and Hillary created. Europe, including nations surrounding Russia, are amassed with refugees, terrorism, and countries that have been brainwashed by Obama and Hillary to hate Putin.http://newsworldpaper.com/index.php/2016/10/20/putin-blows-obama-blaming-emails-releases-proof-obama-head-isis/

Obama's Department of Justice, the Mass Media, the DNC and Hillary Clinton have almost succeeded, by attacking Trump. Their defense, was to go on offense and they flooded the media, with claims of violence, even rape. The violence was found to be planned and instigated by paid Team Hillary goons, who even rehearsed before hand. Their offense was all staged and fake. It‚Äôs all fake, the fake rape lawsuit was even dropped the week before the election. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt, dishonest politician to ever run for office.

Look what happen in France, German and Sweden. Now they are trying to figure out how to get them out of their country. The FBI, CIA, and NSA said there is no way to vet them. Your will put our country, are family and friends at risk. She will destroy our country.
23 | Helen Vizcarrondo | 0 | 10154045866790950_10154045943465950 | #1 Fact: Hillary Clinton ignored (600) calls for help from our United States Ambassador to Libya "John Christopher Stevens", resulting in his brutal death along with 3 other America's on September 11, 2012 in Benghazi. **John Stevens was a "friend" of Hillary Clinton's or so he thought**#2 Fact: When questioned about her lack of response to the Benghazi attack, Hillary Clinton's reply was "We have 4 dead American's and at this point what difference does it make?!"#3 Fact: Hillary Clinton's vice chairwoman, Huma Abedin has direct connections to the terrorist group Isis, for both her mother & brother oversee one of the magazines used to recruit new members.#4 Fact: Hillary Clinton is under an FBI investigation for having an unprotected computer server hidden in the bathroom of her home basement's. This computer was found to have top secrete US information, which has been hacked into by no less then five different foreign intelligence agencies, putting America in jeopardy for a terrorist attack. "FBI Sources say,an indictment is more than likely for Hillary Clinton".#5 Fact: 675,000 additional US emails have been found on the computer of Huma Abedin's huband Anthony Weiner.Anthony is currently under an FBI investigation for sexting under aged girls. Leaked information also reveals that Hillary Clinton and Huma both knew of his illegal behaviors for (over 5 years) and did nothing to stop him.#6 Fact: The Clinton Foundation is also under an FBI investigation for money laundering & fraud as well as several other felony charges.#7 Fact: Hillary Clinton's campaign & The Clinton Foundation have been receiving 10's of thousand's of dollar from the very same foreign leaders who funded the Sept 11th attack America.#8 Fact: Hillary Clinton supports late term/partial birth abortion. For those who do not know what that means I will explain: Late term/partial birth abortion means should a female change her mind about giving birth (for any reason) at (any point of her pregnancy) she can have what is called a partial birth abortion. This act results in delivering the child just far enough that the base of the head is exposed. Then surgical scissors are rammed into the back of the neck, cutting into the spinal cord. The scissors are then opened to cut the spinal cord completely, this resulting in the death of a baby that could in fact live outside the womb.#9 Fact: In leaked emails it has been found that several members of the Clinton campaign has mocked the idea that "conservative Catholics would have their children baptized in the same river where John the Baptist baptized Jesus," They have also said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an amazing bastardization of the faith., that Catholics must be attracted to the systematic thought and severely backwards gender relations and must be totally unaware of Christian democracy.‚ÄùHilary Clinton herself has said, " Christians must deny their Faith through the enforcement of laws, by stating that the Christian belief in being pro-life, and anti-abortion, must change, and that this should be done through laws and ‚Äúpolitical will.‚Äù#10 Fact: Leaked emails have proven that some of the mainstream media news stations have been colluding with the Clinton campaign and in fact have been reporting untrue story about Donald Trump.(CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC just to name a few)#11 Fact: There's a undercover video going around shows that Hillary Clinton & the DNC has paid off thugs to cause riots at Trump rallies, paying the protester cash money as well as a new cellphone.#12 Fact: President Obama has not only lied to America about knowing that Hillary Clinton had an unprotected server but he is also working overtime to protect her from being properly prosecuted for no other reason but to preserve his presidential legacy.#13 Fact: Hillary Clinton has signed over 20% percent of America‚Äôs uranium to Russia.**Uranium is used to make atoms bombs**#14 Fact: Hillary Clinton had to return $200,000 worth of furniture, china and artwork she had taken from The White House National Archives that never belonged to her.#15 Fact: Leaked emails show that the top campaign staff of Hillary Clinton has called Hispanic American's "Needy Latino & The Taco Bowl Vote", yet Hillary refuses to denounce theses comments and continues to have theses top campaign staffers on her payroll.#16 Fact: Leaked Emails prove that Hillary Clinton was given the questions in advance for two different debates by the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee Donna Brazile, who just so happened to also be a paid employee of CNN at the time.#17 Fact: Hillary Clinton wants a ‚Äò500% Increase of Syrian Refugees‚Äô to inter America, after top Military Advisers warn that ISIS will in fact infiltrate the Syrian Refugees population and there is no way to have them properly vetted, therefor America is in great danger of a massive attack. "Not a matter of (if) but it's a matter of (when)#18 Fact: Leaked emails shows that U.S. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs "Peter Kadzik" gave Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign a ‚Äúheads up‚Äù about what would be discussed during the oversight hearing on Clinton‚Äôs email scandal.** This is yet another illegal act**#19 Fact: Hillary Clinton has deleted 33,000 emails, she had least 13 phones smashed with hammers and her unprotected computer server had BleachBit software used on it to prevent recovery of files requested by The House Select Committee on the Benghazi attack.#20 Fact: Out of billions of dollars collected by The Clinton Foundation over the years, only a very small percent goes to charity.Meanwhile Clinton's & their friends are receiving high payments for their jobs within the foundation.Our former president Bill Clinton as well as Hillary Clinton, were heavily involved in distributing Haiti earthquake reconstruction funds,Yet years later, news reports reveal that a large number of Haitians still live in deplorable, shanty town, tented cities and an ongoing epidemic of cholera has claimed thousands of lives.Dear Fellow American's,Yes you are in fact possessively, absolutely entitled to our own opinions regarding who you wish to vote for in this or any other election and I am (not) in any way shape or form trying to "demand" for you or any one else to vote a certain way.** Particularly to just appease my own out coming**However, with that said I can not begin to tell you just how truly (shocked) I am to learn that so many American's are unwilling to seek the (facts) regarding this "Historical Election".An election that (will) change the direction of America for the next 30 to 50 years.My words can not begin to convey to you just how sadden I am to learn that so many are willing to cast a vote for a woman who has had a (long history) of evil & questionable behaviors, as the above list is just a very small example of who is she truly is and what she has been known to surround herself with.**A quote from Hillary Clinton**"When Someone Shows You Who They Are, Believe Them".„ÄÄ <3 May God continue to Bless America <3

She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleading the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovereignty of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump. Ask yourself who is helping Hillery with the cover up and why...We want our country back!How many more premium hikes in Obamacare no one can afford??? How many more violent crimes in the streets??? This is Hillary's America. Hillary=a most dangerous TYRANT.Breaking!!! LIARY's Clinton security clearance is revoked AND Huma is under house arrest for suspicion of espionage. Be aware people, Hillary is an enemy of the state!At any rate, Killery will be impeached as planned by Congress. She is guilty of EVERY despicable trick to deny deny deny. Be careful of this evil woman who will bring poverty to America. Be careful of what you hear on main stream media. They are all sponsored by shadow government.Obama sure has a lot to lie for Hillary because he is tied on all her scams and frauds. Worse off, he bankrupt the American people by forcing an unaffordable healthcare rip off system that makes us hard working people pay for all the illegals and criminals in this country. Citizens of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Michigan: PLEASE do not let the country fall under the TOTALITARIAN regime of SCARY CORRUPT MURDEROUS KILLERY.Please, I am beseeching of you, my fellow citizens. It's our only and last chance to clean the swamp and get rid of the filthy politics as usual. It does not matter if you are Republican or Democrat or Independent, you must vote for Trump to STOP the global oligarchy that chose Billery and Kain as puppets. I am not paid by anyone! I love my country so much and I am so afraid of losing it to sinister powers. We have already lost so much by the dirty tricks of the establishment. America belongs to its people, not the weathly elite that wants to enslave us all. Please, we have one last chance to get it right, before scenarios that are taken from Orwell's 1984 will become reality her. God Bless the USA and Donald Trump. ONLY PAPER BALLOT.Do not let Wall Street and foreign groups take over America, my home sweet home! Vote Trump to ensure a future for the next generations!Vote Trump to ensure America remains FREE and SAFE. Fight for Our Constitution! Watch the Hillary's America movie and find out the truth for yourself!Government that controls the main stream media is really a dictatorship! Let's fix the "error" of Obama in the White House! Let's NOT let Killery and him hide the TRUTH from the American People. Let's stop the conspiracies to cancel the Second Amendment, Cash, Gold and private cars. Let's make sure our banks remain all American. Let's breathe fresh air into the economy. HC will anyway have to be impeached and many years of prison await her. Do not let election fraud happen. See something? SAY SOMETHING. Open Eyes people...This is a fight against the DEVIL. If you love America, DO NOT VOTE for KILLERY!!! Billery are buying illegal votes. Fight for America, for real freedom, before we become a dictatorship like North Korea. That's what you will be getting with LIARY!!!CNN=such hypocrites. Anderson not looking too smug tonight. Hope Trump finds out you are not a saint. Hope there will be new laws concerning REAL NEWS REPORTING and not reporting biased BS and if any harm done by reporting filthy rumors there will be JAIL TIME. Why did you try to silence Rudy Giuliani when he spoke of the criminal charges against Billary? You think America wants a criminal in the White House? And to the traitors who want to buy a flight ticket out of here if Trump is elected-go right ahead, leave already do us all a huge favor and don't let the door get in your way! Please, the country needs real patriots! ALERT: CNN AKA CLINTON/CORRUPTION NEWS NETWORK ARE IN COLLUSION WITH BILLERY. SO ARE OTHER NEWS NETWORKS WHO HAVE ALREADY PRONOUNCED BILLERY A WINNER.DO NOT TRUST MAIN STREAM MEDIA. THEY HAVE A VERY DARK ANTI DEMOCRATIC AGENDA. BTW, won't matter how much make up and hair extensions Beyonce puts on-STILL UGLY.Say NO to Billery's Mafia. BTW, the rock star as a campaign strategy was pathetic!!!

This election most heavily depends on voter turnout. Here are the groups that could make the biggest difference.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Anthony Thomas | 17 | 10154045803425950_10154045826730950 | BLM protests against police brutality and corrupted cops. Yet, will vote for a corrupted President under FBI investigation. Do you see why it's hard to take you serious now?
2 | Dylan Marmolejos | 13 | 10154045803425950_10154045805820950 | Hey ladies. Imagine you thought your husband or boyfriend was having an affair. You ask to see his phone. He immediately leaves the house and goes to see his lawyer. He comes back three hours later, (three months for Hillary,)and gives you the phone after deleting 33,000 emails, texts and contacts. You then find out he used the bleach bit app so that they could not be recovered. When you ask him what was deleted, he tells you it was workout routines and recipes. Then you find out he has 11 more cell phones that he never told you about. When you ask to see them he tells you he cannot give them to you because he smashed them all with a hammer after you asked to see the first one. Would you ever trust him again? I would rather have a president who is unpolished and says mean things then one who will sell my country to the highest bidder. We need to take our country back. Our jobs are being taken away. Our healthcare is too expensive. Mine is $600/month now (AND RISING!). My car insurance is still $25 per month (from Insurance Panda), but who knows when our increasingly socialist government will come in and muddle that up? Things are getting more and more expensive as it is. Can we really afford to support the world‚Äôs homeless?Hillary is not a champion of the people. She is an elitist, who believes she is above the law. She is a champion of the Democrat-Republican-Monied Establishment.VOTE TRUMP.
3 | James Nelson | 1 | 10154045803425950_10154045960000950 | You know in your guts that trump is nutsSay what you will but, stop and listen to you're heart.That's why I'm with herPS. The red team has been in charge of congress for the past 6 years
4 | Steve Lancaster | 2 | 10154045803425950_10154045851435950 | What a disgusting choice of celebrities, but wait, Hillary is disgusting  go figure, ugly Language...would you allow your Children to listen to this ?????
5 | Stephen Mckiernan | 0 | 10154045803425950_10154046336800950 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

7 | Bill Simmens | 0 | 10154045803425950_10154046787845950 | Four preventable American deaths in Benghazi, failed policies in Libya, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia, rise of ISIS (how many deaths has ISIS committed), illegal server, unsecured classified and top secret State Department emails, subpoenaed emails destruction, Clinton Foundation connections, scandals, investigations. You call this qualified? Clinton cannot follow basic laws. A lifetime of controversy. Distorted so called Trump's issues are petty compared to Clinton's actions. Clinton has become a multi millionaire through unethical, shady, and maybe illegal means.Trump has become a multi billionaire through ethical and legal means. (any significant wrong doing or finding against Trump would be front page news 24/7. Most of the minor accusations of wrong doing are false, spun or made up, or settled. Anti Trump people are desperate for dirt). Trump, a Global Business Leader (whether you have an appreciation for what that is or not) has a history of mostly success. Clinton, a career politician has a history of mostly failure. I look at accomplishments and performance, not rhetoric. Business leaders compete daily. Politicians compete at election time. Seek truth. The self serving government cartel needs to end. Our country is desperate for a real leader that will serve the people.
8 | Rick Friedman | 1 | 10154045803425950_10154045825555950 | If your thinking of voting for the Reality TV Star:Trump is charismatic and gets great TV coverage. But his Doublespeak message (for the everyday guy, but will bring back trickle down economics and give tax breaks to big corporations and huge breaks to the top 1%) is opposite of how he has acted for his adult life.There's little TV coverage of his 4 bankruptcies on the backs of the little guy,chinese steel,outsourcing,use of illegal immigrants, and all the latest legal issues and assault allegations (See that "liberal" Murdoch paper, the Wall Street Journal, today). Seems hypocritical to what he says he believes in, no? But let's see what KellyAnne says: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cjPfljy0BzQ

10 | Chris Dellheim | 0 | 10154045803425950_10154046569305950 | The group that is going to make the difference will be: those that vote, and those that don't vote! If you don't get out to vote, it is your own fault if your candidate doesn't win! That simple!
11 | Lynn Taylor | 3 | 10154045803425950_10154045830580950 | WHY ARE THERE SO MANY DEPLORABLES???(I am not the author)That is a question many are asking.  This is one of the main reasons. ......I know a lot of people who are planning to vote for Trump & they don't necessarily like him that much, they don't necessarily agree with him on everything, they are not racist or rednecks but are actually pretty decent people.After talking to many of them I wanted to write this.    Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club & he stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives & said, "if you close these factories as you are planning to do & reopen them in Mexico, I'm going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back & nobody is going to buy them."  It was an amazing thing to see, NO politician, Republican or Democrat had ever said ANYTHING like that to executives such as these & it was music to the ears of the people.  He's saying these things for people who are hurting. It's why the beaten down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump. HE is the human malitaf cocktail  they have been waiting for. The human handgranade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them.  On Nov. 8th, election day, although they lost their jobs, although they've been foreclosure on by the bank, next came the divorce and now the wife & kids are gone, the cars been repo'd, they haven't had a real vacation in years, they are stuck with the s#!+¬• Obamacare bronze plan where you can't even get a f%=#¬£*@ percocet.They essentially lost everything they have......except one thing. The one thing that doesn't cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution,  the right to vote. They might be pennyless, they might be homeless, they might be F'd over & F'd up but it doesn't matter because it's equal on that day. The Millionaire has the same number of votes as the person without a job......ONE, & there's more of the middle class than the millionaire class. So on Nov. 8th the dispossessed will walk into a voting booth, close the curtain & put a BIG F'ing X by the name of the man who has threatened to upend & overturn the very system that has ruined their very lives.......DONALD J. TRUMP.  They see that the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump, Corporate America hates Trump, Wallstreet hates Trump, career politicians hate Trump, the media hates Trump.......after they loved him & created him, and now they hate him. Thank you media. The ENEMY OF MY ENEMY is who I'm voting for on Nov. 8th.  Yes, on Nov 8th you, Joe Blow, Steve Blow, Bob Blow, Betty Blow, Billy Bob Blow......all of the Blows get to go & BLOW UP the whole @$!#@‚Ç©¬• system BECAUSE it's their right.  TRUMPS election is going to be the BIGGEST F YOU EVER RECORDED IN HUMAN HISTORY........AND IT WILL FEEL G.O.O.D!!.............by Michael Moore
12 | Lu EG | 0 | 10154045803425950_10154045846605950 | History will ask:  What did you do to stop woefully unprepared, dangerous demagogue, who is according to legal documents, has been accused of raping a 13-year-old child, raping his ex-wife, and attempting to rape a former business associate. What did you do to stop a man who normalizes sexual violence and the objectification of women. What did you do to stop a disgusting piece of garbage who bragged about sexually assaulting women in the 2005 tape, then multiple women came forward to talk about how he did exactly what he bragged about doing on that tape. What did you do to stop a Racist, Xenophobic, Islamophobic and Misogynistic disgusting pig who is enthusiastically endorsed by Neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and Other Extremist Leaders. What did you do to stop a bully who run a fact free, conspiracy theories driven Alt-Right ideologies, insult- driven cynical campaign of hate and fear. What did you do to stop a man who is a unique threat to American democracy and is a great threat to world peace. What did you do to stop Putin's little bitch who is unpatriotic and scary- a puppet for a dangerous man who was a KGB foreign intelligence officer. What did you do?? You better believe I will be asking the same questions anytime I vote for a candidate for any public office until the day I die. Ask yourself if you're doing everything you can in these last days of this historic election cycle to stop a narcissistic sociopath who is temperamentally, emotionally, intellectually unfit to hold the highest office in the land. Are you doing your part to stop a man who is one of the greatest treats of our time- a man whose presidency would be a danger for the entire world.

Electing her could very well lead to a constitutional crisis that could paralyze the federal government and make us vulnerable. Aside from criminality, Hillary is the most corrupt and flawed candidate ever to run on a major party ticket for President. Americans are sick of the corruption and scandal that continually surrounds the Clintons. Four more years would distract us from tackling the serious challenges facing the American people. She is the poster child for ‚Äúpolitics as usual‚Äù at a time when we need change.Here are the 11 federal laws that Hillary Clinton and her associates have been accused of violating -U.S. Code ¬ß 798 ‚Äì Disclosure of classified informationU.S. Code ¬ß 1031 ‚Äî Major fraud against the United StatesU.S. Code ¬ß 371 ‚Äì Conspiracy to commit a federal offenseU.S. Code ¬ß 1924 ‚Äì Unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or materialU.S. Code ¬ß 2071(b) ‚Äî Concealment, removal, or mutilation generallyU.S. Code ¬ß 1346 ‚Äî Definition of ‚Äúscheme or artifice to defraud‚ÄùU.S. Code ¬ß 641 ‚Äì Public money, property or recordsU.S. Code ¬ß 1343 ‚Äì Fraud by wire, radio or televisionU.S. Code ¬ß 1505 ‚Äì Obstruction of proceedings before departments, agencies, and committeesU.S. Code ¬ß 1519 ‚Äî Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in federal investigations18 U.S. Code ¬ß 793 ‚Äî Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information

18 | Michael Ervin | 0 | 10154045803425950_10154046558170950 | Please get the word out. Copy and paste...  Share, share, share before it's too late.#1 Fact: Hillary Clinton ignored (600) calls for help from our United States Ambassador to Libya "John Christopher Stevens", resulting in his brutal death along with 3 other America's on September 11, 2012 in Benghazi. **John Stevens was a "friend" of Hillary Clinton's or so he thought**#2 Fact: When questioned about her lack of response to the Benghazi attack, Hillary Clinton's reply was "We have 4 dead American's and at this point what difference does it make?!"#3 Fact: Hillary Clinton's vice chairwoman, Huma Abedin has direct connections to the terrorist group Isis, for both her mother & brother oversee one of the magazines used to recruit new members.#4 Fact: Hillary Clinton is under an FBI investigation for having an unprotected computer server hidden in the bathroom of her home basement's. This computer was found to have top secrete US information, which has been hacked into by no less then five different foreign intelligence agencies, putting America in jeopardy for a terrorist attack. "FBI Sources say,an indictment is more than likely for Hillary Clinton".#5 Fact: 675,000 additional US emails have been found on the computer of Huma Abedin's huband Anthony Weiner.Anthony is currently under an FBI investigation for sexting under aged girls. Leaked information also reveals that Hillary Clinton and Huma both knew of his illegal behaviors for (over 5 years) and did nothing to stop him.#6 Fact: The Clinton Foundation is also under an FBI investigation for money laundering & fraud as well as several other felony charges.#7 Fact: Hillary Clinton's campaign & The Clinton Foundation have been receiving 10's of thousand's of dollar from the very same foreign leaders who funded the Sept 11th attack America.#8 Fact: Hillary Clinton supports late term/partial birth abortion. For those who do not know what that means I will explain: Late term/partial birth abortion means should a female change her mind about giving birth (for any reason) at (any point of her pregnancy) she can have what is called a partial birth abortion. This act results in delivering the child just far enough that the base of the head is exposed. Then surgical scissors are rammed into the back of the neck, cutting into the spinal cord. The scissors are then opened to cut the spinal cord completely, this resulting in the death of a baby that could in fact live outside the womb.#9 Fact: In leaked emails it has been found that several members of the Clinton campaign has mocked the idea that "conservative Catholics would have their children baptized in the same river where John the Baptist baptized Jesus," They have also said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an amazing bastardization of the faith., that Catholics must be attracted to the systematic thought and severely backwards gender relations and must be totally unaware of Christian democracy.‚ÄùHilary Clinton herself has said, " Christians must deny their Faith through the enforcement of laws, by stating that the Christian belief in being pro-life, and anti-abortion, must change, and that this should be done through laws and ‚Äúpolitical will.‚Äù#10 Fact: Leaked emails have proven that some of the mainstream media news stations have been colluding with the Clinton campaign and in fact have been reporting untrue story about Donald Trump.(CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC just to name a few)#11 Fact: There's a undercover video going around shows that Hillary Clinton & the DNC has paid off thugs to cause riots at Trump rallies, paying the protester cash money as well as a new cellphone.#12 Fact: President Obama has not only lied to America about knowing that Hillary Clinton had an unprotected server but he is also working overtime to protect her from being properly prosecuted for no other reason but to preserve his presidential legacy.#13 Fact: Hillary Clinton has signed over 20% percent of America‚Äôs uranium to Russia.**Uranium is used to make atoms bombs**#14 Fact: Hillary Clinton had to return $200,000 worth of furniture, china and artwork she had taken from The White House National Archives that never belonged to her.#15 Fact: Leaked emails show that the top campaign staff of Hillary Clinton has called Hispanic American's "Needy Latino & The Taco Bowl Vote", yet Hillary refuses to denounce theses comments and continues to have theses top campaign staffers on her payroll.#16 Fact: Leaked Emails prove that Hillary Clinton was given the questions in advance for two different debates by the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee Donna Brazile, who just so happened to also be a paid employee of CNN at the time.#17 Fact: Hillary Clinton wants a ‚Äò500% Increase of Syrian Refugees‚Äô to inter America, after top Military Advisers warn that ISIS will in fact infiltrate the Syrian Refugees population and there is no way to have them properly vetted, therefor America is in great danger of a massive attack. "Not a matter of (if) but it's a matter of (when)#18 Fact: Leaked emails shows that U.S. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs "Peter Kadzik" gave Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign a ‚Äúheads up‚Äù about what would be discussed during the oversight hearing on Clinton‚Äôs email scandal.** This is yet another illegal act**#19 Fact: Hillary Clinton has deleted 33,000 emails, she had least 13 phones smashed with hammers and her unprotected computer server had BleachBit software used on it to prevent recovery of files requested by The House Select Committee on the Benghazi attack.#20 Fact: Out of billions of dollars collected by The Clinton Foundation over the years, only a very small percent goes to charity.Meanwhile Clinton's & their friends are receiving high payments for their jobs within the foundation.Our former president Bill Clinton as well as Hillary Clinton, were heavily involved in distributing Haiti earthquake reconstruction funds,Yet years later, news reports reveal that a large number of Haitians still live in deplorable, shanty town, tented cities and an ongoing epidemic of cholera has claimed thousands of lives.Dear Fellow American's,Yes you are in fact possessively, absolutely entitled to our own opinions regarding who you wish to vote for in this or any other election and I am (not) in any way shape or form trying to "demand" for you or any one else to vote a certain way.** Particularly to just appease my own out coming**However, with that said I can not begin to tell you just how truly (shocked) I am to learn that so many American's are unwilling to seek the (facts) regarding this "Historical Election".An election that (will) change the direction of America for the next 30 to 50 years.My words can not begin to convey to you just how sadden I am to learn that so many are willing to cast a vote for a woman who has had a (long history) of evil & questionable behaviors, as the above list is just a very small example of who is she truly is and what she has been known to surround herself with.**A quote from Hillary Clinton**"When Someone Shows You Who They Are, Believe Them".„ÄÄ <3 May God continue to Bless America <3

4 | Constantin Pavel | 79 | 10154045732375950_10154045756895950 | When the German residents found the corpses of the Jews after the Soviet invaded Germany, they were astounded and shocked and crying not understanding how it'd come to that. Yet, they didn't realize they voted for a dictatorship over Germany 12 years before that, because they didn't trust their democratic system anymore. Also, they voted for human rights to be taken away from those deemed as "the other". Today, these supporters repeat the mistake of allowing dictatorial speech and supporting the rise of democratic suppression.

10 | Mike Doyle | 20 | 10154045732375950_10154045958970950 | I wouldn't believe a word from Trump's mouth. He has no credibility as a honest speaker.When it's discovered he's been lying or otherwise misleading the America people, he or his spokespeople say, he misspoke, his words were misinterpreted, he didn't actually mean what he said or the latest and most puzzling, the words used were 'inartful.'

12 | Russ Duncan | 4 | 10154045732375950_10154046197050950 | That's how fascists operate, they declare someone a criminal, then they find a crime.  "I love the poorly educated".  When fascism arrives it will be wrapped in the national flag.  "I love the poorly educated, so poorly, poorly educated, nobody loves the poorly educated more than me."  When hitler came to power he had the government gathered in their main bldg., then he called out names of the people he declared were criminals (opposition members of course) and those poor souls were led out and never seen again.  Needless to say nobody spoke against him from then forward.  Heil mein fuhrer..........it didn't end well for their country.

18 | Thad Cardine | 11 | 10154045732375950_10154045755110950 | üá∫üá∏I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump.

25 | Mario Arroyo | 5 | 10154045732375950_10154045923730950 | You know how you Trump supporters are always saying, ‚ÄúHe tells it like it is‚Äù? Let me remind you of something. Racism is not new. Xenophobia (the dislike or suspicion of anyone not from your country) is not new, either. These things have been around for centuries. We all have them inside us, but we keep them under wraps. You know why? Because we are civilized! Civil-ized! We know not to walk around mouthing obscenities or insults or racial slurs‚Ä¶we know we have to live together on this one planet; there is nowhere else to go. In the past, when we let those racial insults enter into our daily interactions with other human beings, wars happened‚Ä¶people were killed or maimed; horrors of ferocious magnitudes were unleashed upon ourselves. So we learned to keep our mouths shut and be civilized toward each other. There is no other way! Those suspicions and disdain will always be with us; what keeps us as decent civilized people is we keep them under control. Under control! Donald Trump urges you to let those racial and xenophobic emotions loose, and you have forgotten why you kept them under control originally. He is not, ‚Äútelling it like it is‚Äù; he is telling it like it isn‚Äôt! And like it should not be! We have come a long way toward being a civilized society; and the rest of the countries in the world all participate in the maintaining of a civilized society. Why would you even consider letting Donald Trump undo that? Don‚Äôt regress into the cave-man anarchy where everything is uncivilized. Get yourself under control‚Ä¶and vote blue.

HAPPENING NOW: Donald Trump speaks in North Carolina, where the presidential race is virtually tied: http://cbsn.ws/2ezPvCf
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mark Bray | 70 | 10154045715325950_10154045717485950 | What disgusts me about Trump and his positions is not that I haven't read or listened to them; I have. What disgusts me is that he is anti-Constitution in his desperation to throw groups of people who are not the majority away in the scrap heap in order to gain power (violates Father of the Constitution James Madison Federalist Number 10 who said no tyranny of the majority). He also uses simplistic explanations of complex issues that simply do not work and are red herrings to help propel him to power--he says build a wall--no wall in the history of humanity has worked--ask the people who built the Great Wall or the Maginot Line Wall and all the others. He says have Mexico pay for it. How and why? Use trade surplus money--that is not money of the Mexican Government but corporations and people--so he is advocating appropriating private property which is against the "life, liberty and pursuit of property (happiness) key fundamentals of the American Journey. He says to undo trade agreements but the reality is that they help our Economy more than they hurt us and Nobel Laureates agree--or if you don't believe in experts let a high school student be a general commanding troops then or a Biology student in anatomy do your open heart surgery. I can go on and on--and the Trump positions would not help America or the World, and they will hurt the people who support him more than they would possibly help, and therefore he is a net negative on the American and global equation and needs to be sent on his way to the hinterlands where he belongs.
2 | Lu EG | 57 | 10154045715325950_10154045722660950 | History will ask:  What did you do to stop woefully unprepared, dangerous demagogue, who is according to legal documents, has been accused of raping a 13-year-old child, raping his ex-wife, and attempting to rape a former business associate. What did you do to stop a man who normalizes sexual violence and the objectification of women. What did you do to stop a disgusting piece of garbage who bragged about sexually assaulting women in the 2005 tape, then multiple women came forward to talk about how he did exactly what he bragged about doing on that tape. What did you do to stop a Racist, Xenophobic, Islamophobic and Misogynistic disgusting pig who is enthusiastically endorsed by Neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and Other Extremist Leaders. What did you do to stop a bully who run a fact free, conspiracy theories driven Alt-Right ideologies, insult- driven cynical campaign of hate and fear. What did you do to stop a man who is a unique threat to American democracy and is a great threat to world peace. What did you do to stop Putin's little bitch who is unpatriotic and scary- a puppet for a dangerous man who was a KGB foreign intelligence officer. What did you do?? You better believe I will be asking the same questions anytime I vote for a candidate for any public office until the day I die. Ask yourself if you're doing everything you can in these last days of this historic election cycle to stop a narcissistic sociopath who is temperamentally, emotionally, intellectually unfit to hold the highest office in the land. Are you doing your part to stop a man who is one of the greatest treats of our time- a man whose presidency would be a danger for the entire world.

Yet, they didn't realize they voted for a dictatorship over Germany 12 years before that, because they didn't trust their democratic system anymore. Also, they voted for human rights to be taken away from those deemed as "the other". Today, these supporters repeat the mistake of allowing dictatorial speech and supporting the rise of democratic suppression.

19 | Lynn Taylor | 2 | 10154045715325950_10154045736930950 | WHY ARE THERE SO MANY DEPLORABLES???(I am not the author)That is a question many are asking.  This is one of the main reasons. ......I know a lot of people who are planning to vote for Trump & they don't necessarily like him that much, they don't necessarily agree with him on everything, they are not racist or rednecks but are actually pretty decent people.After talking to many of them I wanted to write this.    Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club & he stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives & said, "if you close these factories as you are planning to do & reopen them in Mexico, I'm going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back & nobody is going to buy them."  It was an amazing thing to see, NO politician, Republican or Democrat had ever said ANYTHING like that to executives such as these & it was music to the ears of the people.  He's saying these things for people who are hurting. It's why the beaten down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump. HE is the human malitaf cocktail  they have been waiting for. The human handgranade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them.  On Nov. 8th, election day, although they lost their jobs, although they've been foreclosure on by the bank, next came the divorce and now the wife & kids are gone, the cars been repo'd, they haven't had a real vacation in years, they are stuck with the s#!+¬• Obamacare bronze plan where you can't even get a f%=#¬£*@ percocet.They essentially lost everything they have......except one thing. The one thing that doesn't cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution,  the right to vote. They might be pennyless, they might be homeless, they might be F'd over & F'd up but it doesn't matter because it's equal on that day. The Millionaire has the same number of votes as the person without a job......ONE, & there's more of the middle class than the millionaire class. So on Nov. 8th the dispossessed will walk into a voting booth, close the curtain & put a BIG F'ing X by the name of the man who has threatened to upend & overturn the very system that has ruined their very lives.......DONALD J. TRUMP.  They see that the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump, Corporate America hates Trump, Wallstreet hates Trump, career politicians hate Trump, the media hates Trump.......after they loved him & created him, and now they hate him. Thank you media. The ENEMY OF MY ENEMY is who I'm voting for on Nov. 8th.  Yes, on Nov 8th you, Joe Blow, Steve Blow, Bob Blow, Betty Blow, Billy Bob Blow......all of the Blows get to go & BLOW UP the whole @$!#@‚Ç©¬• system BECAUSE it's their right.  TRUMPS election is going to be the BIGGEST F YOU EVER RECORDED IN HUMAN HISTORY........AND IT WILL FEEL G.O.O.D!!.............by Michael Moore

HAPPENING NOW: Hillary is speaking in Florida days before the election. Her favorite part of Beyonce and Jay Z's performances last night? "Beyonce had her backup singers and dancers in pantsuits!" http://cbsn.ws/2fsjWYy

1 | Janet Sanzenbacker | 341 | 10154045702790950_10154045705720950 | Hillary, remember the ad you ran against Trump, "our children are watching" ? What a disgusting choice of celebrities, but wait, you are disgusting yourself, go figure
2 | Stephanie Ker | 148 | 10154045702790950_10154045740940950 | You mean the Jay Z whose lyrics and music is riddled with profanity,  lewdness and complete degradation of women?  Or Beyonce who preformed at the superbowl and clearly supported the Black Panthers and also sings about "pu**y" among other disgusting themes.  Yeah, they're quite the representatives of the Democratic candidate.
3 | Gary Allen | 171 | 10154045702790950_10154045714460950 | People came for the concert then left before she spoke. LOL Trump doesn't need celebrities to get people to show up to his rallies.
4 | Gary D Totusek | 82 | 10154045702790950_10154045707940950 | The new leaks being released this weekend will provide documents in the form of emails, pictures, and videos. Within these will be evidence of Bill Clinton, as well as at least 6 other Government officials, taking part in acts with minors. As well as evidence of Human trafficking that also included minors.
5 | Lorna Blaco | 62 | 10154045702790950_10154045721065950 | Stick a fork in Hillary! She's done! Who cares what Beyonc√©'s backup singers and dancers were wearing! The biased Clinton News Network reporting something that isn't actually news!üòÜ
6 | Tom Beatty | 51 | 10154045702790950_10154045724690950 | My favorite part was the majority of the crowd left after the concert before she spoke. I'm guessing she might "open" for Katy Perry tonight!! lol
7 | Michael Bell | 34 | 10154045702790950_10154045791585950 | The same Jay Z who has been insulting and degrading women for years? The same Jay Z who has been promoting racism, violence and murder for years? What a fantasist role model! Read the disgusting lyrics from Jay Zs newest song "Monster" where he talks about raping and pillaging women and children and murdering niggas. And this is who Hillary wants at her rallies and who she's proud to have support from. Hillary Clinton is a pathetic disgrace to this country.
8 | Rose Miceli Burke | 29 | 10154045702790950_10154045736715950 | Oh wow back up singers in pant suits. I guess that's more important than the issues the regular American people are experiencing such as astronomical health premiums, stagnant wages as well as terrorism we face.

10 | Jodie Featherston Moss | 15 | 10154045702790950_10154045709100950 | I don't like either candidate. However, presentation is important. The president is a representative, if you will, of our country. People from all over the world, our allies & enemies, judge us in large part, by the demeanor of our leader as he/she speaks. Trump has no filter. He cannot handle criticism. He cannot handle opposing views. He cannot handle a tough situation. He throws a fit like a belligerent, childish man, even during speeches. He makes the most obscure, immature, irresponsible remarks. All for the world to see. Hillary, is able to maintain her composure, at least act professional & has a filter when on camera. These qualities are very important when the world is watching.I had originally planned to vote third party. Now I've decided this election, isn't the election to do that. I'll be giving Hillary my vote to help keep sociopathic Trump, out.

Why is she even still able to run in this election? The American people have fallen to an all time low. This is our country.....we run it. We put people on those positions. We will all be slaves and have nothing.....no freedom of choice no money...we will be told what we have to have just like Obama has done and if we don't they will take more of our money. They will continue to tell us what to say and not because some idiot gets offended. Really? Just fricken leave then...please. Our people and government have become pathetic and other countries laugh at us.....can't blame them sadly. Idiots idiots idiots!!!!

Sullivan also wrote that someone named Bill was ‚Äútrying to make sure Chris Stevens gets into E.

Regarding his location and travel plans, the email said, ‚ÄúThe current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage off shore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days.‚ÄùApril 8, 2011: An email among State Department employees that was later forwarded to Clinton said, ‚ÄúSecurity situation in Benghazi remains quiet. Chris Stevens & team are in the hotel, moving only for meetings as required.‚ÄùApril 10, 2011: Another email among State Department employees later forwarded to Clinton marked said, ‚ÄúThe situation in Ajdabiyah has worsened to the point where Stevens is considering departure from Benghazi. The envoy‚Äôs delegation is currently doing a phased checkout.April 24, 2011: A final email among State Department employees later forwarded to Clinton: ‚ÄúStevens will be meeting with MFA in one hour and will make a written request for better security at the hotel and for better security-related coordination. He still feels comfortable in the hotel. They are looking into the idea of moving into a villa, but that is some way off.‚Äù
