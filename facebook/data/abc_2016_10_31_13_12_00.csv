It‚Äôs still too early to say whether any of the newly-discovered emails are truly ‚Äúnew‚Äù to FBI agents who have been investigating the matter for more than a year.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Svetlana Borowka | 30 | 10154962474048812_10154962489873812 | I have now as well the feeling that this election is rigged. Trump is right. If Hilary looses and he wins, than only because of the actions of his republican party friend.
2 | John McAuliffe | 41 | 10154962474048812_10154962476388812 | It doesn't matter how new or old they are. Comey realises he was wrong to take the unprecedented move by unilaterally shutting down the case in the first place, and is now trying to save his own reputation and that of the FBI
3 | Michael Rodriguez | 36 | 10154962474048812_10154962479663812 | People worried about these BS emails that have still not shown any real damning evidence against Hillary. While trump hasn't released his taxes and he has multiple law suits against him and he rapes women.
4 | Ralph LaVerne Bowers Jr. | 9 | 10154962474048812_10154962485578812 | It now appears with other reports coming out that the AG and the DOJ was stifling the FBI in its duty to investigate. And Comey with trying to be transparent was only left with forcing their hand by reporting to congress with this letter he has sent to them.
5 | Franky Ramirez | 10 | 10154962474048812_10154962482458812 | Let them do their job because the FBI is neither Rep or Dem. They have an incredibly difficult job and they have some of the worlds smartest men and women who do it effectively. This is not about politics, this is about if Hillary committed a crime. Legally. That's not partisan, that's just a fact. And yet, people are hurt over words than what Hillary Clinton did. That's just fact.
6 | Cameron Ghafoor | 17 | 10154962474048812_10154962476708812 | If it was to early, why the hell would you try to throw a candidate under the bus?
7 | James Davis | 7 | 10154962474048812_10154962493793812 | She's corrupt so why is she still in the race and still talking about her she should be out of the election period this is a disgrace to America
8 | Jorge Briones | 4 | 10154962474048812_10154962497713812 | Well let's see here, she turned over 30,000 emails and deleted 33,000 the FBI just found more than 650,000 emails in Huma Abedin's lap top, what are the chances that maybe just a few of them are new to the FBI? Does the media really think that the people of the United States üá∫üá∏ are that stupid? GIVE ME A BREAK!!!
9 | Kris Miranda | 0 | 10154962474048812_10154962513878812 | Republican Director Comey for any potential violations of the Hatch Act. The timing of this Director Comey was making a political move, and not a professional one.‚Äù What is the purpose of the Hatch Act?A. Passed in 1939, the Hatch Act (Act) is the law that restricts the partisan political activity of civilian executive branch employees of the Federal Government, District of Columbia Government, and some state and local employees who work in connection with federally funded programs.

11 | Al Franklin | 0 | 10154962474048812_10154962530108812 | Comey already answered everyone's questions.He testified to Congress when democrats were saying his ethics were unquestionable, four things that would reopen this investigation.Evidence of:IntentLying to investigatorsObstructing justice Sending government documents to foreign governments Pick your poison
12 | Gregory L King | 0 | 10154962474048812_10154962507323812 | Frist abc you should report what you know not what you want people to think the point is are there emails or not not how new or old they are and second if there is a crime then it needs to be taken care of like any other crime would be no matter if they are running for President or not , what we do not need is elected then impeached.

14 | David Villafuerte | 1 | 10154962474048812_10154962507768812 | LOL yeah, try to distract ABC. Pretend that FBI reopened it for the lulz. Whether you vote for Hillary or not, you know she's crooked and part of the establishment.
15 | Douglas H Darter | 1 | 10154962474048812_10154962497093812 | What to know is the Director of the FBI should be fired. He is too easily politically motivated. Or maybe he could manage the office in Nome Alaska.
16 | Vivien Cheung | 1 | 10154962474048812_10154962507033812 | Why No Trump:Trump has upcoming FRAUD and child RAPE in Nov, Dec.Trump tried to do business in Cuba during an embargo. Trump used his charity's money to buy a portrait of himself and pay fines. Trump lied about donating to veterans and 9/11 charities. Trump stiffed sub-contractors out of payment. Trump used illegal Polish immigrants to build Trump Tower. Trump was sued for not renting to black people.

Trump has been repeatedly fined for breaking rules related to his operation of casinos. Trump was fined $750,000 by the FTC for failing to disclose his purchases of stock in two companies.The hypocrisy of Trump supporters is too funny and too sad at the same time.
17 | Vivien Cheung | 1 | 10154962474048812_10154962508513812 | Republican Comey is intentionally breaking election guidelines and abusing his power to influence the election in Trump favor...by releasing vague info about Weiner not Hillary. Its unprecedented and unethical.

20 | Richard Burke | 18 | 10154962474048812_10154962476408812 | Anyone voting for a criminal under FBI investigation for high crimes, should be openly shamed.

25 | Luis Alberto Vega | 8 | 10154962474048812_10154962476918812 | Let this sink in: Hillary's crimes are so bad, she is literally running for president in order to stay out of jail.

The only person not in on the fix was Donald Trump, and yet he held his own. We can't even have a fair and impartial presidential debate in this country because the media and the democrats are in bed together. That is thoroughly disgusting. Thoroughly undemocratic, and thoroughly UnAmerican.  And of course it's much worse than that. Think about this. What kind of presidential candidate would go along with the rigging? What type of person would say, "Oh good... you got the questions... let's have those?"Hillary should have announced that questions were offered to her in advance and here's the people doing it, and I want a fair debate and I won't be a part of this.But what did she do? She covered up the crime. She accepted the rigging, kept her mouth shut, studied hard to try and make her answers look spontaneous. What kind of president would she make.... I ask you?#DrainTheSwamp

It was sent on March 5, the day before Clinton debated Bernie Sanders in Flint, Michigan.‚ÄúHer family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint,‚Äù reads the body of the email.According to debate commission rules, no candidate is supposed to be given any questions in advance of a debate.This is not the first time that Wikileaks emails have revealed how Brazile tipped off Hillary‚Äôs campaign with debate questions in advance.A previous email entitled, ‚ÄúFrom time to time I get the questions in advance,‚Äù gave Clinton the nod that a question would be asked about the death penalty.The latest email completely demolishes Brazile‚Äôs claim, made during a fiery exchange with Megyn Kelly, that she didn‚Äôt receive debate questions in advance.During the interview, Brazile appeared rattled, at one point suggesting that the email was fake or doctored, with no evidence.This latest revelation provides yet more bombshell evidence of collusion between the media, specifically CNN, and the Clinton campaign.

Very sad Trump tactics keeping the POOREST poor and unhealthy.However, the Supreme Court ruling on the ACA effectively made the Medicaid expansion optional for states. For those that expand, the federal government will pay 100 percent of Medicaid costs of those newly eligible from 2014 to 2016.5 The federal share gradually phases down to 90 percent in 2020 and remains at that level thereafter. #trumptape #trump #bigothttp://kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-how-does-it-work-and-what-are-the-implications/

5 | Jamian Isaacs | 20 | 10154962222743812_10154962258998812 | And the city government there seems more concerned and offended by the factual statements made by Donald Trump than admitting they have major issues and doing something to resolve them. Game one is appreciating the potential president shining a light on the blight of your area. Bunch of idiots, they are.
6 | Shalia Heugatter | 23 | 10154962222743812_10154962325063812 | This has nothing to do with democrat or republican leadership - this is all due to the lack of parents being present and a no respect for authority or rules attitude. Government will not change this nor will the police - it has to come from the people themselves. Until the community comes together and makes it clear to the thugs that have taken over you will not put up with it anymore it's just going to get worse.
7 | Robert Infranco | 15 | 10154962222743812_10154962319983812 | Perhaps Colin kapernick would like to spend some quality time in Chicago than disrespecting our flag that many have given their lives to defend.....
8 | Brandon Webster | 20 | 10154962222743812_10154962279328812 | Chicago is on the fast track to becoming the new Detroit. You can thank your non working government for their dedication of destroying a city.The primary thing that kills a popular city is lack of tourism. Once your tourism fails, everything else will crumble.Keep restricting those gun laws though! Its working fantastic!
9 | DaChon Adair | 3 | 10154962222743812_10154962428938812 | It is a way of life here. We are becoming numb to the death as we see no one is doing anything to stop it. No one includes the community,  the Mayor, elected officials,  the Governor, or the police. I strongly believe this is how the Democrats, who are the majority political power in this State, want it! As long as the violence doesn't interfere with the money that goes to people in power they see no need to do anything to change the violence.
10 | Charly Sullivan | 10 | 10154962222743812_10154962252813812 | you know, how about you cordon off the inner city, add a couple of blocks extra, just to be sure, and give everyone a handgun! Problem solved
11 | Dennis Lam | 5 | 10154962222743812_10154962274598812 | The toughest Gun Control, but still ... "There's been a spike in street violence this year with over 600 homicides already." Demoncrats used wrong solutions for the problems. In purpose or incompetence?
12 | William Haase | 4 | 10154962222743812_10154962291188812 | Don't worry Barry's got this right after his mean tweet appearance on the Kimmel show, watching Michelle dance on Helen's show and a quick stop to a Hillary campaign rally.
13 | Kim Pham | 6 | 10154962222743812_10154962268103812 | The LAPD faced similar numbers and created a task force with multiple divisions to combat Gang violence. They have had some success with this, and Chicago would do well to adopt their model. There's no easy answer, but it's a start. http://www.lapdonline.org/south_bureau/content_basic_view/47122
14 | Joan Stewart Kerr | 6 | 10154962222743812_10154962276368812 | none of us would want to live there and we most likely have no idea how awful it is, all about drugs and who controls what areas, even trump cannot solve this, feel sorry for all the good people caught up in it
15 | Adam Baum | 8 | 10154962222743812_10154962247308812 | Ridiculous. I keep hearing it's confined to a small part of the city. If that's true, shouldn't that make it easier to clean up? Why does the city admin accept this?
16 | Jon Laye | 1 | 10154962222743812_10154962339368812 | Why is the federal government not sending in military reserves to weed out the terrorists killing Americans in Chicago? We're safer in Afghanistan
17 | Stephen Wuest | 0 | 10154962222743812_10154962440663812 | This is a spiraling syndrome. Welfare poverty, gang violence, illegal drug and weapons trade -- the dysfunction of the pipeline that could get someone out of this poverty, which is education and a decent job. ...  This is the same categorical failure as thinking that bringing Syrian refugees into a first world economy, when they don't know the language of business, and don't have marketable skills in a first world economy, would succeed. Obama's theory on solving persistent urban poverty, and integrating 2nd or third world refugees into a first world economy, are the same failure. No one is dealing with the dysfunctional values of subcultures in urban poverty, that continue to accurately predict the inability to get and work jobs that would change the spiral. It's much easier to call the crushing economic realities of not knowing the language of business (university English), and not having marketable skills, racism and bigotry. America hasn't effectively begun to deal with the core problems. Nothing will change, until it does.
18 | Chris Cos | 4 | 10154962222743812_10154962311078812 | But the mayor and others were highly offended when Trump pointed out how bad Chicago was, they even took down his street sign.  Why not focus on fixing it instead of worrying about people pointing out the obvious ??
19 | Leslie Hunter | 0 | 10154962222743812_10154962302888812 | Was in wrigleyville this weekend. About 30 minutes after Fridays game, police loaded up into TWO  city busses and left.Made no sense to me. Bars were letting drunks out, etc. The cops literally left. TWO busses!
20 | Marlene Kurilla | 0 | 10154962222743812_10154962438118812 | We have to improve the lives of people living in these neighborhoods. It's going to expensive and it's going to take time but as a City, State and Country, we have try. More money for police is not the only answer. It's may well be part of the answers but. only part
21 | Kason Whitten | 0 | 10154962222743812_10154962380043812 | This is just sad/bad for all involved (victims and perpetrators). Both families will feel the negative effects of lifelong hurt and consequences. Prayers need to go up for the hearts of all at this time.
22 | David Morel | 1 | 10154962222743812_10154962509818812 | They should just give every Thug in Chicago a gun.. within a week one half of the thugs would kill the other half.  So you would have one bad week for crime. Then the thugs would be gone..that would automatically cut your crime rate in half.
23 | Junior Estrada | 2 | 10154962222743812_10154962296423812 | Give all the gang members that get arrested gang injunctions like they do here in California. Which means that if you have any gang tattoos or are a known gang member you get 10years of federal time just for that plus the time for the crime that you where arrested for that should help
24 | Jeanie Miller | 1 | 10154962222743812_10154962339478812 | Philly is like that 2!!!!   & Camden.   It's not about the color it's the deseparation that peeps feel.   Drug use 2 Maybe.

Geez!!!   Stay safe America.   They need to do something about guns & mental illness.   Geez!!!
25 | Dennis P. Miller | 0 | 10154962222743812_10154962410563812 | Michelle Obama should make a speech about how this has shook her to her core! Both Republicans and Democrats should be ashamed that this is going on!!!

Halloween spending is expected to reach a record $8.4 billion this year, with $2.7 billion spent on candy alone!
Happy Halloween! http://abcn.ws/2eTVQX6

1 | Lynn McCarty | 1 | 10154962084783812_10154962248643812 | We have to spend around $100 on candy in our neighborhood because people bus the kids into ours we see hundreds of kids every single year. There cute but dang way too many.  :-(. ps we love each and everyone of the kids btw.

3 | Sasha Bens | 2 | 10154962084783812_10154962135808812 | We moved into a neighbourhood close to the schools that's almost all kids...it's great except at Halloween...last year we had over 300 kids trick or treating. I love seeing all the kids dressed up...but I hate spending the money on candy :(
4 | Ciera Huffman | 0 | 10154962084783812_10154962426758812 | Only spent $5 this yearüòÇ Daughter wanted to be a zombie. I have the make up to fake it. Bought a little fake blood and we are tearing up an old robe and clothes to complete the look. Not passing out candy because it's just me this year to take her trick or treating since daddy is overseas. Feeling good about that $5 lol
5 | Oramajama Deb | 1 | 10154962084783812_10154962239398812 | The problem is, I have to re-buy the candy 3 times if I buy it too early as we eat it all before then.  I just bought two more bags today, lol
6 | Tommy Charles | 2 | 10154962084783812_10154962202093812 | Where is the coverage of Standing Rock? Where is President Obama? Stand up with Standing Rock and protect our clean water. Our children don't want to drink Flint Michigan water. We don't need and cant afford another Exxon Valdez or BP Gulf Horizon. We don't need or want more pipelines, we need less. We need less gas and oil consumption. Without clean water we die.

3 | Sternlicht BJen | 9 | 10154961949573812_10154962001568812 | Let's give a great big congratulations to the highly intelligent people making useless political comments on an uplifting, heartwarming story about NICU nurses trying to bring some happiness into a place where there are a lot of tears.I'm an OBGYN, and the NICU is the last place parents want to be. The nurses who work there are in a league of their own...literally angels sent from heaven. Their job isn't only taking care of babies, they are there for the parents too. I think what these nurses have taken the time to do is beyond kind. If those little adorable costumes bring a smile to a parents face, it's well worth it. You have no idea how hard it is to be there.Petty political arguments have no place on this comment thread, and every single one of you should be ashamed of yourselves! You are the definition of terrible human beings! These are infants...have some compassion and respect for heavens sake.

13 | Marc Langsam | 0 | 10154961949573812_10154962040203812 | I have noticed one thing about most Clinton supporters and their reactions to all of the recent revelations. They are angry, very angry, and so am I. Where we differ is on WHAT we are angry about.They are angry at Wikileaks. They are angry at Assange. They are angry at Comey. They are angry at the Russians. They are angry at Weiner. They are angry at the FBI in general.For what? Having the alleged audacity of affecting Hillary's chances of winning by putting all the corruption surrounding her in the spotlight.Never once do they blame Hillary or her subordinates for the mess she's in. Pathetic.

Bernie Sanders said "HRC has poor judgement," in truth he was actually being kind. HRC is arrogant, reckless to the nth degree and completely lacking in common sense. You and Robby Mook are calling Trump supporters and anyone else who hasn't bought into the HRC BS, deplorables - HRC is NO DIFFERENT FROM HITLER. He referred to Jews as undesirables. HRC is an embarrassment to Americans and America.

Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.)'s perverse sexting habits, Comey was hit by harsh criticism by some of those who initially praised him.Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Benghazi Committee and a staunch Clinton supporter, said in July that he was "proud" of Comey for "doing the right thing", calling him the "epitome of... a public servant", according to Politico.Shortly after the FBI's July decision, President Obama said he would not comment too thoroughly on the topic, but praised Comey for his "exhaustive" investigation.House Minority Leader Nancy D. Pelosi (D-Calif.) called Comey a "great man" for his original decision not to suggest charges against Clinton.

It was sent on March 5, the day before Clinton debated Bernie Sanders in Flint, Michigan.‚ÄúHer family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint,‚Äù reads the body of the email.According to debate commission rules, no candidate is supposed to be given any questions in advance of a debate.This is not the first time that Wikileaks emails have revealed how Brazile tipped off Hillary‚Äôs campaign with debate questions in advance.A previous email entitled, ‚ÄúFrom time to time I get the questions in advance,‚Äù gave Clinton the nod that a question would be asked about the death penalty.The latest email completely demolishes Brazile‚Äôs claim, made during a fiery exchange with Megyn Kelly, that she didn‚Äôt receive debate questions in advance.During the interview, Brazile appeared rattled, at one point suggesting that the email was fake or doctored, with no evidence.This latest revelation provides yet more bombshell evidence of collusion between the media, specifically CNN, and the Clinton campaign.

1 | Rachel Holmes | 3 | 10154961835938812_10154961938388812 | Before you take your children out there to the demons read this to the end!!!! PLEASE SHARE Halloween is not of God!!!!!!The Origins of Halloween‚ÄîWhat Does the Bible Say About HALLOWEEN!!!!!The Bible‚Äôs answerThe Bible does not mention Halloween. However, both the ancient origins of Halloween and its modern customs show it to be a celebration based on false beliefs about the dead and invisible spirits, or demons.‚ÄîSee  ‚ÄúHalloween history and customs.‚ÄùThe Bible warns: ‚ÄúThere must never be anyone among you who . . . consults ghosts or spirits, or calls up the dead.‚Äù (Deuteronomy 18:10-12, The Jerusalem Bible) While some view Halloween as harmless fun, the Bible indicates that the practices associated with it are not. At 1 Corinthians 10:20, 21, the Bible says: ‚ÄúI do not want you to be participants with demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too.‚Äù‚ÄîNew International Version. Halloween history and customsSamhain: The origin of Halloween can be traced to this ‚Äúancient pagan festival celebrated by Celtic people over 2,000 years ago,‚Äù states The World Book Encyclopedia. ‚ÄúThe Celts believed that the dead could walk among the living at this time. During Samhain, the living could visit with the dead.‚Äù However, the Bible clearly teaches that the dead ‚Äúare conscious of nothing at all.‚Äù (Ecclesiastes 9:5) Thus, they cannot contact the living.Halloween costumes, candy, and trick or treat: According to the book Halloween‚ÄîAn American Holiday, An American History, some of the Celts wore ghoulish costumes so that wandering spirits would mistake them for one of their own and leave them alone. Others offered sweets to the spirits to appease them. In medieval Europe, the Catholic clergy adopted local pagan customs and had their adherents go from house to house wearing costumes and requesting small gifts. The Bible, on the other hand, does not permit merging false religious practices with the worship of God.‚Äî2 Corinthians 6:17.Ghosts, vampires, werewolves, witches, and zombies: These have long been associated with the evil spirit world. (Halloween Trivia) The Bible clearly states that we should oppose wicked spirit forces, not celebrate with them.‚ÄîEphesians 6:12.Halloween pumpkins, or jack-o‚Äô-lanterns: In medieval Britain, ‚Äúsupplicants moved from door to door asking for food in return for a prayer for the dead,‚Äù and they would carry ‚Äúhollowed-out turnip lanterns, whose candle connoted a soul trapped in purgatory.‚Äù (Halloween‚ÄîFrom Pagan Ritual to Party Night) Others say that the lanterns were used to ward off evil spirits. During the 1800‚Äôs in North America, pumpkins replaced turnips because they were plentiful as well as easy to hollow out and carve. The beliefs behind this custom‚Äîthe immortality of the soul, purgatory, and prayers for the dead‚Äîare not based on the Bible.‚ÄîEzekiel 18:4.

In a fresh assault on the ISIS stronghold of Mosul, Iraqi special forces fought their way into the city at daybreak this morning under heavy fire.

1 | Lee Maynus | 4 | 10154961729123812_10154961870008812 | ISIS is falling faster than expected. Perhaps the Iraq military has matured a bit since they were humiliated there in 2014.
2 | John Hurley | 3 | 10154961729123812_10154961751468812 | There is nothing special about their forces! Last I checked ISIS is there because those special forces tucked tail and ran...js
3 | Karen Bonsant | 4 | 10154961729123812_10154961783218812 | Clinton and Obama tops the ISIS donor list!! Obama and Clinton both need to prosecuted then hang the lying scum bags! Clinton needs to drop out the race she no longer matters to people with morals. Too bad for the scum bags that supported Clinton's lies! Game over Trump 2016!

9 | John Smith | 0 | 10154961729123812_10154961835158812 | ...........Hillary Clinton criminal investigation UPDATE:FBI already did a meta search on the emails and there are emails from the State Department and from Clinton .

10 | Brian Jong | 0 | 10154961729123812_10154961797853812 | Clinton is the worst candidate in history. The corruption has gotten to the point of complete madness. She is a lying criminal and needs to be indicted and put in prison for life. Mr.Trump will be the most beloved president of the USA. This man knows how to turn this country around folks.
11 | Mable Jean Cook Page | 0 | 10154961729123812_10154962412483812 | Janet Wilson Carter shared this Most people are not aware of the facts stated below, therefore I am sharing this with all of you. *Here is something to think about**, and why so many Americans support Donald Trump !!* (This information has all been checked, then double checked... it is 100% Correct. That's why there is such an alarm within US government, since Trump's statement about temporary suspension of migration of Muslims to US till US authorities make sure there is a proper concept of safe penetration of US territory. People are stunned to learn that the head of the U.S. CIA is a Muslim! Do hope this wakes up some! You mean until it hits you like a ton of bricks read it again, until you understand! We now have a Muslim government. John Brennan, current head of the CIA converted to Islam while stationed in Saudi Arabia. Obama's top adviser, Valerie Jarrett, is a Muslim who was born in Iran where her parents still live. Hillary Clinton's top adviser, Huma Abedin is a Muslim, whose mother and brother are involved in the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Assistant Secretary for Policy Development for Homeland Security, Arif Aikhan, is a Muslim. Homeland Security Adviser, Mohammed Elibiary, is a Muslim. Obama adviser and founder of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, Salam al-Marayati, is a Muslim. Obama's Sharia Czar, Imam Mohamed Magid, of the Islamic Society of North America is a Muslim.. Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships, Eboo Patel, is  Muslim. 1/13/15:?? Nancy Pelosi announced she will appoint Rep Andre Carson, D-Ind, as the first Muslim lawmaker on the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. It would make Carson the first Muslim to serve on the committee that receives intelligence on the threat of Islamic militants in the Middle East! He has suggested that U.S. schools should be modeled after Islamic madrassas, where education is based on the Quran!!! And last but not least, our closet Muslim himself, Barack Hussein Obama. It's questionable if Obama ever officially took the oath of office when he was sworn in. He didn't repeat the oath properly to defend ournation and our Constitution. Later the Democrats claimed he was given the oath again in private. CIA director John Brennan took his oath on a copy of the Constitution, not a Bible..?? Valarie Jarret wrote her college thesis on how she wanted to change America into a Muslim friendly nation and she is a Obama top advisor. Congressman, Keith Ellison took his oath on a copy of the Qur'an. Congresswoman Michele Bachman was vilified and verbally tarred and feathered by Democrats when she voiced her concern about Muslims taking  over our government. Considering all these appointments, it would explain why Obama and his minions are systematically destroying our nation, supporting radical Muslim groups worldwide, opening our southern border, and turning a blind eye to the genocide being perpetrated on Christians all over Africa and the Middle East. The more damage Obama does, the more arrogant he's become! Our nation and our government has been infiltrated by people who want to destroy us. It can only get worse! If you fail to pass this one on, there's something wrong.. Somewhere! In his book he said, "if it comes down to it, I would side with the Muslims". (And still, somen insist he isn‚Äôt Muslim!)n Common sense doesn't grow in everyone's garden

Likely voters see Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump equally unfavorably, with a nearly complete partisan split in views of the two‚Äîtestament both to the unprecedented unpopularity of the candidates and the level of division between their opposing camps.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Emmanuel Nnaji | 331 | 10154961469113812_10154961493583812 | Nice work ABC. I see how you totally ignore the fact that Trump is surging while Hillary, your candidate of choice, is going down. This post should be about how Trump moved from an insurmountable 15 point gap from Clinton to just one point. But you like to talk about how unpopular both candidates are to remove attention from what is happening now. Trump has the momentum and he's winning.
2 | Ryan Cecconi | 360 | 10154961469113812_10154961488083812 | A vote for Hillary Clinton is telling your children it's okay to lie, cheat and be corrupt with zero morality to get ahead in life.
3 | Timothy Mullins | 147 | 10154961469113812_10154961478318812 | These polls are much like Hillary....lies lies and more lies. Trump 2016.
4 | Daniel Mochrie | 128 | 10154961469113812_10154961481503812 | Trump has the Momentum and good on his side. He wants to help all Americans not just the wall street and special interest groups. As a veteran he is my choice. He want to fix the corrupt VA. Get them Trump. Also he is not under an FBI investigation. We all know Hillary is guilty as sin. Drain that swamp Trump.
5 | Alejandra L Mallari | 75 | 10154961469113812_10154961489253812 | ..and the real crook is the one who didn't, doesn't pay income taxes but wants the American people to pay him with their taxes by being president of USA.#dumptrump!
6 | Jennifer Van Gorder | 25 | 10154961469113812_10154961615368812 | Riddled with investigations if she's elected what will that mean for our government, think about it, it would be entering very murky waters.  And what will she be able to get done for our country while consumed with investigations.  Her emails, which put national security at risk, and her foundation, investigation on top of investigation. Not good! She's already made history first presidential candidate under criminal federal investigation AGAIN
7 | Richard Banner | 14 | 10154961469113812_10154961521278812 | I will tell others again..popular vote does NOT matter!..electoral vote does!...having the majority in the right states of our union matters..you may not like the fact..but if not..work to change it..for now..popular vote does NOT matter!
8 | Torrence Moss | 22 | 10154961469113812_10154961495368812 | Who are the 4% with Johnson?  Johnson, nor his running mate could name a world leader. My 13 yr old can give you 6 off the top of his head.
9 | Patty Dunstan Sauve | 18 | 10154961469113812_10154961563958812 | A vote for Hillary Clinton is knowingly and willingly aiding and abetting the worst career criminal in US history to hold the highest office of President in the United States of America.
10 | Kevin Keller | 11 | 10154961469113812_10154961642283812 | The only people still voting for Killary and Co are the closed minded #Bluesheep that don't care about the law or facts and clearly for that matter the country. Say what you want about Trump but there is zero doubt he loves this country and will fight for it and for us non connected people. Hillary is the oppitomy of corruption so if your for a lying cheating murderer then by all means vote for Killary
11 | Sherry Young Johnson | 9 | 10154961469113812_10154961894698812 | If you care anything about our country please get out and vote Trump/Pence. Let's put a stop to the corruption of Hillary Clinton. She should be in jail. She is in this for power not to help the people

13 | Andrew Nickson | 32 | 10154961469113812_10154961485488812 | Trump will go back to his tower and sit on his gold toilet after he loses and will laugh at his peasant followers for falling for the biggest con he has ever pulled on American's yet .
14 | Pat Smith | 9 | 10154961469113812_10154961535738812 | Wasn't it strange when they put "George"  on GMA when they did, it was a political move then to have him for the Democrats in future elections... how deep and corrupt is he into all the drama..he is squirming right now.....
15 | Stephanie Aitchison Cundall | 12 | 10154961469113812_10154961794313812 | When I see people talk about Trump not paying taxes, it makes me wonder if they are really upset cause they are living off the government and worried that they might have to get a job. He did nothing illegal. He had write offs. Which the government you support put in place. Get educated!!!!
16 | Justin Fraioli | 2 | 10154961469113812_10154961810708812 | this poll could easily read Trump 47 Hillary 45 because of the margin of error. The media is misleading as always, even while Hillary is under investigation and most likely will be indicted

18 | John Krum | 4 | 10154961469113812_10154961834803812 | Actually the most Unpopular candidate is still the lying, corrupt, crimminal career politician Hillary clinton. America can do much better.

20 | Randy Moldenhauer | 0 | 10154961469113812_1029539857169073 | Hillary Clinton once said someone who was under FBI investigation shouldn't have been allowed to buy a gun. That's very true!!! Now someone who is also back under FBI investigation should not be allowed to run for President of the United States either. Hillary Clinton should drop out of the Presidential race immediately.
21 | Telly Jackson | 4 | 10154961469113812_10154961635843812 | It is so sad how they play politics and i'm talking the Republican...

It's so important for folks to think about if not now but in the future as well.
23 | Clarence Conner | 2 | 10154961469113812_10154961919053812 | One candidates popularity is based on perception and conjecture formed entirely by the media because he says mean things.The other candidates popularity is based on the actual lying (sniper fire in Bosnia, all started because of a video, etc.), ineptly handling classified information because she "didn't know what the (C) stood for", documented history of harassing and intimidating women who accuse her husband of rape and sexual assault, ineptly handling State Department funds (losing $6 billion), a history of pandering to various groups, and causes division and creates obstacles to the foundation that made this country great.The latter candidate should be avoided like the plague, but instead, we have at least 50% of the country fooled by the rhetoric and the collusive media.  These same people will be the folks that will look to point their finger elsewhere when as we spiral even further downward.  Perhaps, if they are remotely considering Clinton, they should start pointing that finger inward.
24 | Kristoffer Ganga | 1 | 10154961469113812_10154961793408812 | Unprecedented unpopularity. Yep, no matter who wins, we will be a devided nation.

Michael Phelps said he kept his marriage to Nicole Johnson Phelps a secret for months "just because." Now the Olympic swimmer and his bride seem comfortable opening up about their big day.

12 | Kyle Perron | 0 | 10154961387998812_10154962018558812 | Hillary and the media figured they are loosing in a land slide. The FBI director made his announcement fro them. They now have a excuse for loosing by a land slide after acting like they where so far ahead. On another part of this issue. Harry Reed from the senate floor announced Romney never paid taxes for twelve years. Eric Holder is the first AG to be held in contempt of congress for refusing to turn over evidence. The President and Eric Holder made prejudging statements many times in police shooting. They where wrong most of the time. If the president is actively campaigning against Trump he has know right to say Comey is in the wrong. Be careful here the adminastration is looking for a way to declare the election as tainted. He will bring in the UN. None of this is a joke. I Pray Trump stays alive and we get to the transition in peace.

In a change from recent elections, 2016 features no statewide initiatives seeking to expand gun rights.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Akoni Arnie | 36 | 10154961281298812_10154961305643812 | They should really concentrate on places like Chicago where's there's mass shootings on a daily basis. 19 shot 6 dead just over the weekend and it gets no coverage like it's a typical Tuesday night event. Oh wait, Chicago is already has the strictest gun laws in the nation. My bad.
2 | Travis Wampler | 15 | 10154961281298812_10154961415013812 | Becaue more gun laws will stop bad guys from getting them and harming people.... quit taking away law abiding citizen's rights to bare arms and protect themselves and those around them.
3 | John Butler | 6 | 10154961281298812_10154961445868812 | But when all said and done the criminals will still obtain weapons and the tax payers are stripped of another right! One block at a time till it all collapses!
4 | Daniel Williams | 0 | 10154961281298812_10154962339663812 | "The investigation hit a dead-end because the handgun used to kill her was bought without a background check from a seller who told police he did not know the buyer's name. Richardson said the Maine initiative would help reduce gun violence by making firearms harder to access and easier to trace."So they want to be able to trace them easier, but that would also be easier to target legal gun owners and force them to give up their weapons, in essence a violation of the 2nd Amendment. Pick your poison wisely, people.
5 | Scott Schwartz | 1 | 10154961281298812_10154962271163812 | Yeah... Sure. Because ALL the other countries that have far stricter gun laws are sending out fake news about the reductions in gun violence. Like Australia. Lying at us gullible Americans...Ammosexual freaks, stop being afraid of checks. I'm not. Check away. Nothing to hide. And before you say Hillary is going to "eliminate the 2nd", go take a civics class on the congressional and state approval.
6 | Kai Jones | 2 | 10154961281298812_10154961931298812 | No! No! No!We need guns man!It's like the movie 'Red Dawn.' Every American needs a gun in case of foreign invasion like the Russians or somebody else!!!Sick country that lives on fantasy and movies and historic wars.Sick mentally ill country.
7 | Matt Cordel | 0 | 10154961281298812_10154962341173812 | Gun control laws (at least in California) are only aimed at legal gun owners. Not one of the measures keeps criminals from getting guns because the penalties are nothing. The only law that made any sense was the one saying you can't leave a gun unsecured in the car. If you really want to stop illegal guns increase the penalty for carrying illegally to a significant prison sentence. When you only do six months it's not deterring criminals at all.
8 | John Millsaps | 5 | 10154961281298812_10154961330403812 | People are withdrawing their support for Hillary!!!! They cannot support the corruption any longer. Longtime Clinton supporter Doug Schoen is withdrawing his support, saying that if Hillary is elected there will be a constitutional crisis
9 | Pete Shaw | 0 | 10154961281298812_10154962100018812 | How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care.Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection.After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations.She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply.She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation.Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense.Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . .She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?)After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

13 | Freddie Miller Jr | 3 | 10154961281298812_10154961299823812 | Because street gangs, drug lords and other criminals always observe the gun laws.

15 | Tom Lacerte | 3 | 10154961281298812_10154961450363812 | Gun laws don't prevent criminals from getting guns. Criminals don't obey laws. That's what makes them criminals.

7 | Nathan Deplue | 2 | 10154961025823812_10154961077038812 | President Obama needs to be impeached as a traitor for breaking his oath of office to "PRESERVE, protect, and defend the United States Constitution" (Emphasis added), in unconstitutionally expanding his presidency, via Executive Orders, into a kingship. President Obama is also guilty of treason for adhering to, aiding and abetting the enemies of this country by using taxpayer money to finance the Muslim Brotherhood's global jihad and working to replace our Constitution with a Shariah-compliant, New World Order, Socialist/Communist agenda. Also and in the alternative, President Obama is not a natural born citizen (or even native born) and, according to the United States Constitution, he is not eligible to be the president. Please do your duty as a member of Congress and impeach Mr. Obama and his Administration and restore the United States Constitution as the supreme law of the land by repealing/striking down via legislation any and all government agency regulations, Executive Orders, and laws in opposition to the United States Constitution.

16 | Kyle Perron | 0 | 10154961025823812_10154962019503812 | Hillary and the media figured they are loosing in a land slide. The FBI director made his announcement fro them. They now have a excuse for loosing by a land slide after acting like they where so far ahead. On another part of this issue. Harry Reed from the senate floor announced Romney never paid taxes for twelve years. Eric Holder is the first AG to be held in contempt of congress for refusing to turn over evidence. The President and Eric Holder made prejudging statements many times in police shooting. They where wrong most of the time. If the president is actively campaigning against Trump he has know right to say Comey is in the wrong. Be careful here the adminastration is looking for a way to declare the election as tainted. He will bring in the UN. None of this is a joke. I Pray Trump stays alive and we get to the transition in peace.
17 | Nathan Deplue | 1 | 10154961025823812_10154961076433812 | When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn‚Äôt even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts. Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood ‚Äì both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno ‚Äì husband Bill described her selection as ‚Äúmy worst mistake.‚Äù Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovery of Ms. Guanier‚Äôs radical views, her name had to be withdrawn from consideration.Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations. She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.Many younger votes will have no knowledge of ‚ÄúTravelgate.‚Äù Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson ‚Äì and the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds. A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the scandal defense. Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were:She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary‚Äôs game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, ‚ÄúI do not recall,‚Äù ‚ÄúI have no recollection,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù a total of 56 times while under oath.After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen.Now we are exposed to the destruction of possibly incriminating emails while Hillary was Secretary of State and the ‚Äúpay to play‚Äù schemes of the Clinton Foundation ‚Äì we have no idea what shoe will fall next. But to her loyal fans (supporters) - I guess in her own words ‚Äúwhat difference does it make?‚Äù I guess being a female Democrat is all that matters. By the way, I'd post the same if she were a Republican. You see, she's already been in the White House, she has a record we can review.Hillary for prison 2016 would be a good start to help make America safe again.

Eight Fresno children who died without families got full burials this weekend in the city's Garden of Innocence in a ceremony that gave each child a new set of brothers and sisters.

2 | Dana Hartwell | 529 | 10154960918488812_10154961014073812 | The hospitals don't always ask or give a mother a choice about remains of a miss carried infant in the early stages.  I lost a baby at around 2 months, big enough to hold in the palm of my hand but not fully formed enough to know if it was a male or female. They never gave me any choice.  They sent it to a lab to find out what caused the miscarriage. Nothing was ever said about what they would do with the remains. I did name the baby. It broke my heart. My husband died in 2004. I would like to believe he is with our baby raising him or her there.

He had been dead a couple of days from what they could tell.Six little girls found him in a trash bag in a creek near some woods. Wally World donated an outfit. & teddy bear, a funeral home their services, someone a grave & someone a headstone. He was named by the girls---James Forest Green. Over 200 folks attended the service for him.By the way the girls were ages 6 thru 10.  I don't know what they went thru, finding him like that, but am sure they haven't forgotten him.As far as i know the parents were never found.God bless ALL the unknown & known children who hve died so young.

She's a LIAR about everything...and she's damn good at it. Her father, Satan is the master of all lies. Nuff said.3. She doesn't care about homosexual and women's rights....as a matter of fact, she doesn't care about anyone's rights, just hers and her global NWO buddies and it's a very small club. You're not invited.4. Her resume speaks for itself. Her whole career has been nothing but lies, corruption, criminal activity and SECRECY! That's how you know she's wicked, they do their dealings in darkness behind closed doors. Remember, she said she has TWO FACES....one in public....the other in private."Ye shall know them by their FRUITS!" ~ Jesus ChristWoe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

One miscommunication or lack of communication after the next,  no empathy or understanding or heightened level of customer service to the passengers. It was a nightmare! They lost all credibility with the whole flight tonight. They could've handled  much better. Extremely disappointed! And btw 6+ hours later we still haven't left yet.

19 | Matthew Byrne | 0 | 10154960819143812_10154961358673812 | The cause of terrorism is the United States' history of "greedy military interventions." It's the greed of trans-national corporations not the American people. We can end this war and actually prevent terrorism by changing our foreign policy and using more diplomacy. U.S. foreign trade policy currently focuses on business interests at the expense of workers rights. The low wages etc. cause the outsourcing of U.S. jobs and illegal immigration. We do not need to build a wall. The answer is to gradually increase wages and regulations there, not lowering our wages and regulations. The interest of big-business do not have to conflict with workers' rights and environment protection. Higher buying power will indeed increase business sales and expand the economy.Jill Stein For President and Down-Ballot "Berniecrats"

6 | Russell Parker | 15 | 10154960636298812_10154960639178812 | If Huma is forced to resign over this, it will be the 8th DNC operative that was fired or forced to resign this year. At what point does the FBI step in and say, "Enough is enough, we are indicting you under the RICO act"...?
7 | Lisa Davis | 0 | 10154960636298812_10154961195508812 | #SuperPredator ""But we also have to have an organized effort against gangs," Hillary Clinton  said in a C-SPAN video clip. "Just as in a previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on. They are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators ‚Äî no conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first, we have to bring them to heel."
8 | Jimmy Dula | 10 | 10154960636298812_10154960689913812 | I live in Oklahoma the ABC news outlet here was all over this while it was happening. The other news media not so much. Well done .

11 | Richard Maltese | 3 | 10154960636298812_10154961895068812 | A criminal was shot by police! We should riot and burn down our cities!!!

21 | Samantha Ray | 1 | 10154960636298812_10154961875303812 | It was scary! Many residents in the small town nearby heard every bit of that shootout. Such a quiet and calm place. üò≥
22 | Jennifer Hayes | 0 | 10154960636298812_10154961460813812 | I didn't see that going any other way. So glad this man can't terrorize anyone else.

24 | Anthony Mike | 1 | 10154960636298812_10154960642333812 | Wow, he looks a lot like Abraham who was also killed this past week except we will miss Abraham!

1 | Anthony Mike | 633 | 10154960613008812_10154960621528812 | If I was that dude I would have been all kinds of "cat avoiding the bathtub of water" doing all kinds of kicks, flips and dips...seems staged, edit- I do not know Kung Fu but I know a WHOLE lot of crazy! Saved my life at 14 from being abducted from a pedo. teach your kids- kick scream, fight and die on scene if necessary because if they take you to the second spot nobody will hear you or find you....
2 | Patty Sparks-Long | 237 | 10154960613008812_10154960637328812 | I've read if locked in the trunk look for the emergency release.  You might have to jump, but I'd take the odds on jumping in that scenario
3 | Krissy McKay | 253 | 10154960613008812_10154960634278812 | Hopefully this is one of those "kidnap for a bachelor party" kind of things...
4 | Alicia Gunnoe | 113 | 10154960613008812_10154960736693812 | That looks like a newer car. He would be able to open the trunk from the inside. Asked my mom to lock me in my trunk to see if i could get out. The handle glows in the dark! Its cool.
5 | John Anthony Lopez | 81 | 10154960613008812_10154960802308812 | I don't know. Looks staged. I mean why is the guy not fighting harder? Why isn't he making a big commotion with people walking around him. And he went into that trunk way too easy. Doesn't feel right. It looks to me like Halloween gag. Maybe acting as mobsters?
6 | Byrin Colliers | 99 | 10154960613008812_10154960678848812 | This right in front of the store. Why dude didn't run back inside the store? Where is the greeter in the yellow vest at? I have questions.
7 | Johnny Washika Gachago | 51 | 10154960613008812_10154960627838812 | Either staged to cause more fear by mainstream news or these guys knew that man and are mentally sick enough to kidnap out in the open
8 | Kevlar Perez | 44 | 10154960613008812_10154960706473812 | Looks fake... who the hell lets someone just throw them in the trunk. Our first natural instinct is to put our foot up to stop it. He dives right in like there's a million dollars in the trunk. No type of pulling back or anything.
9 | Jamie Beeler | 13 | 10154960613008812_10154960732093812 | If you're put in that situation, find where the break light is and kick as hard as you can until it gets burned out or thrown out of the car. Police will definitely pull the abductor over
10 | Alaura Shouse | 9 | 10154960613008812_10154961271508812 | Looks like a prank on a friend. Initiation or something . for one, he really doesn't fight them. Two, these kids parked right in front of the store totally unconcerned about the cameras. Three, has anyone been reported missing? Or was this just some crazy footage.
11 | Daniel W Martinez | 27 | 10154960613008812_10154960636103812 | I seen this before! it's just his friends trying to fake a kidnapping to get him away from his wife !
12 | Larry Messina | 5 | 10154960613008812_10154961764203812 | How come Walmart catches shoplifters quickly, but when a person is getting kidnapped in their doorsteps they seem helpless.... I don't understand, boycott Walmart now
13 | Damb Vue | 8 | 10154960613008812_10154960942808812 | I hate how witnesses just watch everything and not take any action but when the cops show up the make it seem as if they were about to do something
14 | Sam Werner | 1 | 10154960613008812_10154962013158812 | Check to make sure ALL of Hillarys advisors, aides, and "friends" are still with her .... the one that knows too much about her might be missing... but on a serious note Prayers for this person
15 | Jenna Reed | 5 | 10154960613008812_10154961107673812 | If you're going to kidnap someone, is a Walmart parking lot the best place? Especially right in front of the door? Cameras and people everywhere.
16 | M√°rio Lindbergh | 2 | 10154960613008812_10154961549688812 | Find the break light, kick it and put your arm or hand through it until someone sees you and call the police!
17 | Dianne Buck Ritner | 5 | 10154960613008812_10154961357803812 | License plate?? My wallet was stolen at our local Walmart, and they had multiple photos of the thief's plate.  And that was in a small town. Geez
18 | Rosalyn A Jarrett-Davis | 3 | 10154960613008812_10154961914338812 | No one bother to get the license plate number or write down the make and model of this car.  It's so sad people just sit and watch, what if that were you or one of your family members you would want someone to help.
19 | Yalanda Rodney | 1 | 10154960613008812_10154961709398812 | Okay this has to be staged A. This is not far from me and I go there often B. It too many people a steady flow of people 3.there is alway security near by it.4. It is in a crowded area of town the mall is within feet, so is Sam's and its in a lit area
20 | Matthew Rogers | 4 | 10154960613008812_10154960789413812 | Probable works for Wikileaks..   if not it's probably over money or revenge. Pretty much the only 2 reasons a man gets thrown in a trunk.
21 | Eponine Romo | 1 | 10154960613008812_10154960969008812 | Idk this kind of looks staged to me. Or like..... being kidnapped as part of a frat house rush or bachelor party or something?
22 | Jeff Sellers | 6 | 10154960613008812_10154960675388812 | Yeah its not real he broke away from one guy and easily could have pulled away from the other but he let the one guy grab him back.
23 | Vladimir Moreno | 0 | 10154960613008812_10154962475698812 | He could easily save his life by kicking the lights from inside the trunk!!!! Then wave his hand for help. And most new models of cars, you can open the trunk from inside too.  Hope he is ok!!! üôèüèæ
24 | MarySue Filtz | 0 | 10154960613008812_10154961943418812 | Didn't we just hear about a girl being kidnapped in the same manner, on video?    Is this the next clown sighting thing??    Hope so, better than if it is real.
25 | Pamela Anderson Harris | 0 | 10154960613008812_10154961614168812 | If other people saw it why didn't they jump in their car and follow them. I know I would. At least as far and long as you can why calling the police.
