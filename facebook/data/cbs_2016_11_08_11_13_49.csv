1 | Jan Payne | 8 | 10154054635390950_10154054653790950 | Clinton has 71.2 percent chance of winning the presidency. Clinton's path to 270 is pretty much easier than Trump's. Trump dug himself a huge hole from moment he announced his candidacy.
2 | –û–ª–µ–≥ –ë–∞–±—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á | 1 | 10154054635390950_10154054657885950 | Trump is Putins candidate. If he becomes president, then the whole world will be enslaved by Putin and ISIS. ISIS is russian organization created by former KGB USSR agents such as Muammar Gaddafi fighters.
3 | John Hebert | 11 | 10154054635390950_10154054647305950 | So, if you are ok with a stagnant economy, scandals, corruption, high taxes, job killing regulations, massive under employment, huge national debt, inner city crime, riots, cop killings, illegal immigrants, Syrian refugees, endless wars, terror attacks, late term abortions, massive black unemployment, Obamacare and Common Core...then you should vote for Hillary Clinton.

5 | Maura Nestor Haverly | 3 | 10154054635390950_10154054663135950 | tough choice - on rump's side you've got the folks who want to repeal the 19th amendment and the KKK...on Hillary's side you've got the smart folks..#votedforthesmartone

7 | Adam Kapps | 7 | 10154054635390950_10154054647680950 | Pretty sad when 90% of the map is red and they still show Killary winning. Liberal logic... common core math in play much?
8 | Joseph Grodis | 6 | 10154054635390950_10154054654425950 | DEPLORABLE VETERAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA HERE! JUST VOTED FOR TRUMP! #HillNo
9 | Dawna Martich | 3 | 10154054635390950_10154054644500950 | Why would I even think of watching CBS? Are you serious? MSM? never.
10 | Rich Luksza | 3 | 10154054635390950_10154054651270950 | Corrupt arrogant elites,Stop and think.country over politics.Tell DNC hate doesn't work we're united against corruption.FBI STILL INVESTIGATING CLINTON FOUNDATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'!!!'!!!!!Morons for government corruption, wake up smell the coffee, their SOCIALIST and we're loosing our democracy wake up!VOTE VOTE VOTE VOTE VOTE VOTE VOTEZOMBIES ARE AMONG US, VOTE VOTEOur democracy is at risk people, the writing is on the wall, Hillary's maid is copying, receiving and reading confidential information. Putting HRC into the Oval Office, with her judgment is a disgrace to the American people she has taken millions and millions of dollars from countries and peoples that sponsor TERRORISM!!! Why would the same countries that sponsor TERRORISM sponsor HRC, do you think it may have something to do with her stance on letting 3/4 million refugees from Syria which we can not vet properly, their whole goal is to get people in positions where they can commit Jihad, that's what they invest in they want to hasten the coming of their messiah, if you care about your country and its not racist to put America first, it's just common sense.
11 | Mike Johnson | 6 | 10154054635390950_10154054648595950 | When you cast a vote for a proven corrupt candidate; YOU become an intimate part of that corruption.How about making our justice system great again by ensuring our laws apply to everyone, including the Clintons . VOTE TRUMP.
12 | Michael Angelo de Castro | 2 | 10154054635390950_10154054644450950 | One thing Trump has proven is that unconditional love, being nonjudgmental, and moral relativism really does not exist for the left. Of course many of us already knew this. Watching it play out bigly is comical. Enjoy!

21 | Jim Gavin | 1 | 10154054635390950_10154054657505950 | Because we already know Hiliary called Blacks "Super Predators", Latinos "needy" , Catholics "backwards" . She has put national security at risk to hide her corruption in the "Clinton Foundation" Which has paid for her daughters wedding and living expenses for the past 10 years. She is married to a convicted rapist. She's not qualified to be POTUS. She hasn't done anything to earn the job within even the political world, other than be married to a guy who has achieved as president but still was disgraced with sexual scandals.
22 | Avery Vonblon | 0 | 10154054635390950_10154054659440950 | Rather than a path to Trump' s victory wouldn't a path to America's destruction be more accurate.

They get paid to rig the system. They have no term limits. They are the real disease. THIS IS the political revolution. Without a corrupt congress, a corrupt president has no power.

Bob Schieffer has covered 14 presidential elections over the course of his career, but he said he‚Äôs never seen one quite like this: ‚ÄúIt is as if the nation is enduring some kind of curse."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Christopher CJ Stolte | 17 | 10154054561915950_10154054599295950 | As Election Day is upon us, I find myself more worried than I've ever been. I realize that no matter what happens today, this country is in trouble. The people spoke months ago, and it seems somehow we ventured into infinite ignorance of the electorate. We had choices, good choices, possibly solid choices, and instead, we picked two of the worst, by far, candidates to run this country. Maybe it's a sign of the times, of where, as a society, we truly have our heads at. We gave this country the choice between Celebrity vs Gender, rather than substance. I can't help but wonder how we'd look if we had chosen Cruz vs Sanders. In the wake of it all, so much divisiveness in this country. So much hatred, bigotry, and fear, and it may only get worse, no matter who wins today. Honestly, no matter what, the real loser is America, and we've got only ourselves to blame.
2 | Linda Summers | 18 | 10154054561915950_10154054590590950 | So you cover Hillary and point out all her good points and now you cover Trump and pull up all the things to make him wrong, instead of focusing on his good points....shame on you.  Maybe focus on how he is going to change our system to a better country because he doesn't accept shabby work.  Stop poking fun of him...shame on you....
3 | Ida J Petty-Nutter | 4 | 10154054561915950_10154054613090950 | Watching the morning show. Just saw Donald J. Trump and Hillary recap. They put only good up on her and only the derogatory on him. Shows me where they stand. What ever happened to news, they have all gone for op-eds. The only reason I am staying on this channel is, it is a timer for what I need to do during the day.
4 | Daniel Wornica | 14 | 10154054561915950_10154054571805950 | Curse of a two party system there needs to be a third maybe even a fourth legit option. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein should have been allowed to debate but the royal houses and puppet media won't allow anyone to penetrate their den of corruption.
5 | Kendra Sisneros | 2 | 10154054561915950_10154054613400950 | When will the media be the unbiased stage they say they are?  I am so tired of all media outlets that don't just deliver the news but spout their owners personal opinions and bias.  CBS is among the worst.
6 | Holly Bailey | 1 | 10154054561915950_10154054597955950 | Not exactly intentional voter fraud but local polling location attendant stupidity. I went to vote and the gentleman in front of me (behind the curtain) selected a write-in but apparently hit the wrong button so he called for the attendant who did not know how to correct the situation so she called over to the other attendants and the man (in his best Nancy Pelosi voice) said push the button and "see what happens." Really? That's the level of competence at the polling location here. Well what happened was it registered part of his voting selections but they had no idea to to correct it and couldn't figure out whether to let him vote again or allow his partial selections. Not one attendant there knew how to handle the situation which was unfortunately not a surprise. Run Forrest Run!
7 | Lou Kief | 0 | 10154054561915950_10154054614325950 | This is ELECTION DAY. All of us out here are sick to death of political spin, and for you to host Eric Trump on the morning show is more than a little disturbing. The polls are OPEN in case you haven't noticed. Shut the hell up with statements and interviews that can influence people's decisions. Your reporting today should be on getting people out to the polls everywhere. We've seen quite enough of ALL the politicians and can't stand another second of political ads or spin. Do your damn job and stay neutral and QUIET today and let America, not media, decide who will lead this country.
8 | Ronald Mallow | 1 | 10154054561915950_10154054664245950 | Not a curse... Gods wrath. Our nation is being ran and voted on by almost all who haven't fought for it, and minorities. It won't last much longer at this rate. Unless God intervenes and saves us, we are about to become a bankrupt country, morally and financially
9 | Sharon DelBrocco | 0 | 10154054561915950_10154054638640950 | It's like The Devil has invaded the political scene and it seems to be a product of these times that is only 'out to destroy' instead of coming together for the good of all. You say: Oh, you are a dreamer and it is not real...but if you surrender to all that is bad that is all you get and the 'devil' has won. You have a choice. You can decide where you want to go.
10 | John Woodard | 0 | 10154054561915950_10154054627195950 | I pray that once this is over we as people, as a nation, can recover from this the most divisive and hate filled campaign in history. I pray that we can come back together, united peacefully for the good of   humanity and live in harmony.
11 | Sue Horine | 0 | 10154054561915950_10154054628615950 | Congratulations, you just produced the most biased piece of media bullshit I have ever witnessed in my life. Your bias toward Clinton has reached its peak this morning.

13 | Ashur DeKelaita | 2 | 10154054561915950_10154054578840950 | Not a curse, not aliens, not ghosts... Just a flawed system which is entirely within our reach to change and mold a better future for ourselves if only corrupt corporations and greedy leaders, and yes, our mass media which is disloyal to the public, were willing to make admonitions and enact real change to make the lives of ALL Americans unanimously better.
14 | Linda Summers | 0 | 10154054561915950_10154054603740950 | Why should I watch CBS when it only covers what it wants in favor of who CBS wants as President.  Let me find another station that sees that without Trump thins will stay the same....30 years is enough.
15 | Carol Krantz Webb | 0 | 10154054561915950_10154054618100950 | Its called corruption Bob - and we are not going to take it anymore. It's not just government corruption it's corruption on journalists being in bed with politicians. The people are going to make journalists do their job.
16 | Bob Hunter | 4 | 10154054561915950_10154054577145950 | The nation IS enduring a curse because it has abandoned morality and rejected God's order of things. Many have decided to live without God and they are reaping the consequences.

19 | Jim Spedden | 0 | 10154054561915950_10154054634745950 | The curse is deception. When evil is applauded, promoted and glorified, our nation is enduring a curse.

22 | Chepo Team | 13 | 10154054561915950_10154054563190950 | As American hispanics, we are tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. Celebrate Trump's victory by getting the fantastic Trump Strong t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/trumpstrong .And let's Make America Great Again! Thank you.

1 | James Bushart | 41 | 10154054527890950_10154054551875950 | When the election is over, will CBS News be moved to Comedy Central where their liberal entertainment bias is more relevant?

3 | Bonnie Hamilton Strickland | 1 | 10154054527890950_10154054670845950 | To CBS (better known as Clinton Broadcasting Station): Is there any possible way that you could enlist reporters that keep their opinions and emotions out of their reporting? In particular, I am quite weary of hearing Major Garrett pontificating. It is as bad as listening to the candidates. Whose's brilliant idea was it to assign someone to follow DJT, who is so obviously biased?? (P.S. I vote Independent).
4 | Rob Kelley | 1 | 10154054527890950_10154054671090950 | A bit far from the syrupy verbal glop dribbled like caramel syrup on the Hillary Clinton votes for herself story earlier in the day. Major Garrett or Major Tool. You decide.

6 | Darrin Richards | 2 | 10154054527890950_10154054580935950 | Wikileaks provided the proof that Hillary Clinton's campaign hired radicals to incite violence at Trump rallies across the nation where Hillary's hired thugs drew blood from innocent people.

17 | Ron Capobianco | 1 | 10154054527890950_10154054590435950 | Donald Trump: "Hillary Clinton I think is a terrific woman," he said. "I am biased because I have known her for years. I live in New York. She lives in New York. I really like her and her husband both a lot. I think she really works hard. And I think, again, she's given an agenda, it is not all of her, but I think she really works hard and I think she does a good job. I like her."    "I just like her," Trump remarked, adding the same of the former president. "I like her husband. Her husband made a speech on Monday and was very well received. He is ‚Äî he is a really good guy, and she's a really good person and woman."http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/donald-trump-hillary-bill-clinton-relationship-217191
18 | Ken Licau | 4 | 10154054527890950_10154054533265950 | As an independant, the choice came down to this. If I had more legitmate/viable choices I would choose someone other than these two. For whatever reason, we the people and especially the mainstream media hold republicans to a higher standard and would NEVER allow Trump to get away with even half Hillary's corruption and or incompetence (it has to be one or the other or a combo). In addition, although I would love to see a woman POTUS, Hillary as POTUS would dishonor the sex and probably embarrass it as well.

Clinton and Trump have the worst election-eve images of any presidential candidates dating back to 1956.

2 | Tony Stanfill | 3 | 10154054499445950_10154054525590950 | They're both complete morons. What would anyone expect!? Hillary Clinton is as corrupt as it gets. Donald Trump is an expert of dealing bullshit. No matter who wins this election, America will lose.
3 | Erik Kruck | 6 | 10154054499445950_10154054505435950 | I want to hear about the key battleground state of Michigan.. you know that one state that the polls were completely wrong in the primaries.. had Clinton up 21 points when she lost to Sanders
4 | Ken Licau | 9 | 10154054499445950_10154054510260950 | As an independant, the choice came down to this. If I had more legitmate/viable choices I would choose someone other than these two. For whatever reason, we the people and especially the mainstream media hold republicans to a higher standard and would NEVER allow Trump to get away with even half Hillary's corruption and or incompetence (it has to be one or the other or a combo). In addition, although I would love to see a woman POTUS, Hillary as POTUS would dishonor the sex and probably embarrass it as well.
5 | Kathleen Hanratty | 0 | 10154054499445950_10154054570745950 | Trump has had several rally's in New Mexico and has not provided an interpreter for the deaf.... doesn't he know about the American with Disabilities Act?... it is a Federal Law to provide accessibility to EVERYONE
6 | Philip Wayne | 2 | 10154054499445950_10154054524580950 | And that is a total lie about Clinton, which the media has perpetuated. She has been found guilty of nothing during more than 30 years of public service. Dishonest? Many of us don't agree. Trump is a vile, immoral human being supported by facts.
7 | Grace Olstenger | 0 | 10154054499445950_10154054651980950 | Yes, with the massive, overflowing crowds that Trump has had over the last few weeks especially, his image appears to be completely tarnished!  LMAO!!!!!!!!
8 | Heine Inge Graawe | 0 | 10154054499445950_10154054651885950 | We believe Trump is a grave threat to democracy, freedom, human rights, equality, and the welfare of our country and all our people.We have witnessed Trump inciting hatred against Muslims, immigrants, women, the disabled. We have seen him evidencing dangerous tendencies that threaten the bedrock of democracy: unleashing a lynch mob mentality against protestors, calling for the expulsion of Muslims from the country, bullying, and fear-mongering.History has shown us what happens when people refuse to stand against hate-filled leaders.We pledge ourselves to speak out in every way possible against the politics of hate and exclusion he represents.
9 | Laura Coleman | 0 | 10154054499445950_10154054582480950 | I'm so sick of her and Obama telling the average American's what kind of country we are. They have no idea who the average American is. And the average American is sick to death of their lies, and corruption. All their shit about the middle class, and the poor is just that Bullshit. After 8 years of Obama, the rich like the Corrupt Clintons have gotten richer, while the average American tries to figure out how to pay their bills. The greedy Clintons with all their money, cheated those who contributed to the Clinton Foundation, using their money to pay for their spoiled daughters wedding, and 10 million dollars apartment. Hell Chelsea wouldn't even campagin for her money without a pay check from the Clinton Foundation. Oh but it does good work, my ass! Just imagine if the Trump Foundation had done that. Rag news outlets like this one would be all over him!
10 | Donald Cozzi | 1 | 10154054499445950_10154054529715950 | CBS thinks the Democrats own the Hispanic votes, and they have done this to African Americans for decades, I hope at the end of the day, CBS looks like a bunch of fools

17 | Judith Mike Cook | 3 | 10154054499445950_10154054503850950 | Hillary admitted to deleting over 30K government documents, which is a federal crime.

21 | Leo Decaj | 4 | 10154054499445950_10154054509440950 | Keep this in mind before you Vote please .Donald Trump did not steal your money. Donald Trump did not raise your taxes. Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food. Trump is not stirring a race war. Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims. Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda. Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East. Trump did not betray Israel. Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. Trump did not cripple our economy. Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars. Trump did not ruin our credit, twice. Trump did not double African American unemployment. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans. Trump did not set free all of terrorists in Guantanamo bay. Trump did not steal your rights, violate US Constitutional law, or commit treason, hundreds of times. Yet Trump is being ripped apart in the news, non stop. Barrack Hussein Obama, Hillary Clinton and the criminals occupying our government, are not. The media is the Democratic Party. Save our culture. Stop listening to them..!!
22 | Mike Wright | 3 | 10154054499445950_10154054504455950 | Even a corrupt president has no power without a corrupt congress. Time to vote out all these old scumbag parasites who have no term limits. This is Bernie's Sanders plan. A political revolution. All incumbents must go. Vote for Berniecrats and green and third party. The corrupt status quo two,(one) party system must change today.
23 | Tom Lacerte | 0 | 10154054499445950_10154054590400950 | All the evil things Donald Trump did, he did while he was a Democrat. Trump has changed and he has become a better man. Trump has become a Republican.
24 | Nickolas DeNuzzio | 2 | 10154054499445950_10154054509430950 | Wouldn't have been like this is we didn't have Crooked Clinton as the Democratic nominate. Nobody should be running for president under federal investigation.
25 | Chepo Team | 4 | 10154054499445950_10154054507455950 | As American hispanics, we are tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. Celebrate Trump's victory by getting the fantastic Trump Strong t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/trumpstrong .And let's Make America Great Again! Thank you.

1 | Micheal Rogers | 53 | 10154054425585950_10154054464090950 | I can't wait to see who the deplorables blame for their defeat today. I'm sure it will be the blacks, Islam, Hispanics, liberals, emails, the Fbi, George Soros, the media, Miss America, Trumps small hands,  basically everyone but themselves for nominating a guy that was simply in it, to boost his ego, and promote his hotel.
2 | Bomi Smile Adeyemi | 23 | 10154054425585950_10154054432700950 | what a pity, the US election has turn to a big reality show, where anyone have a say and predict... what a joke
3 | Laura Kline | 18 | 10154054425585950_10154054484705950 | He says Hillary has no yard signs. That's because his supporters are stealing them! My local Dem headquarters office has a steady stream of people needing replacements. In another state a frustrated friend finally posted a note next to her third sign: "every time you steal a sign we donate $100 to the Hillary campaign and $100 to Planned Parenthood." Seems to be working.
4 | Oystein Heimstad | 22 | 10154054425585950_10154054440065950 | Doing amazing in the most illiterate, red neck and racist areas indeed.

6 | Sharon Hunter Allen | 2 | 10154054425585950_10154054482810950 | I just heard a comment on CNN that I believe is a lie!!!  A woman reporter just said that there are many women out there that have started different groups because they don't want to say who they are voting for or are ashamed of their choice. I do not believe that. They have created these groups to get away from the NASTY harassment they receive if they voice their opinions not because they are ashamed. What a thing to assume.
7 | Chris Dessources | 16 | 10154054425585950_10154054452135950 | He looks like a lizard in a human costume. I'm not lying here.
8 | Catherine Day Sonenberg | 2 | 10154054425585950_10154054470350950 | Let the games begin!!This post is for the 'undecided' out there as well as to those that are saying, "I'm writing in", "I'm not voting" and "I'm picking someone other than the Top 2". This is a YUUUGE Election. We are forced to pick the 'lesser of two evils'. This is due to the fact that we didn't get to hear from the Libertarian and Green Party candidates in the Debates. We might actually have found compelling candidates to vote for, if the American people spoke up (if it wasn't for their low support %'s) If Trump ran as an Independent as I wish he had done, then maybe there could have been a Republican, 3rd option. Though I've said it many times and I still stand by it,  our next President has already been selected and for ALL the WRONG reasons. I'll leave it at that but I'm hoping that there was a chance that I'm wrong about our Political System. I'm voting for my life. I'm voting for my money. I'm voting for the benefit and the well-being for my Family. This is why YOU should do the same and vote for Donald J. Trump!!!!- "LOCK HER UP" Hillary Clinton DESERVES to go to jail and should NOT have been able to run for the Presidency for the simple fact of being caught LYING; aside from having SO many other questionable charges against her. When you have someone who has a track record of behaving with an "I'm above the law" mentality and then make her President, what message does it send to the rest of the country? How should we trust a woman (person) who doesn't even deserve to have a security clearance as President?- Another thing to know about Hillary Clinton---- she is corrupt to the core!!!! If she becomes President, the US government will be controlled by the corrupt, "Pay-to-Play", money laundering Clinton Foundation. She started this when Bill was in office and continued on as Secretary of State. Do you really think these people really wanted to hear Bill speak? Please.... They paid him by giving ENORMOUS sums of money and large gifts to the Foundation. That's UNETHICAL by every meaning of the word which further proves that the Clinton's were receiving outright BRIBES. But again, Hillary is untouchable!!- Since the death of Scalia, Obama has been unable to select his replacement. Thank You SJC. It will be considered after the election. This bodes well because 3 of the current judges are 'up there in age' and Ginsburg has once stated that she would retire. She has since taken it back. But what if, WHAT IF, I said, she's waiting for Hillary to WIN? Well, if she retires, that can be another 2 open seats for the Democrats to fill. If that happens, well.... Just imagine. SCARY!!!!- There were more than 600 emailed requests for HELP, military support and added Security for Benghazi. 4 Americans are dead because ALL those requests had been ignored. Hillary has also helped create the Iranian nuclear deal, in which we gave $1.7 Billion to an anti-American nation to get nuclear weapons. Despite the fact that we are a nation it's most likely to use them on, the fun fact that it will create a new nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Was this a "penalty/fine" for the Drone that crashed in Iran not too long ago??? After all, it's interesting that they too are a terrorist supporting nation.- Hillary wants to reward illegal immigrants by granting them American citizenship because she feels that our borders are secure. She is also promising an amnesty Bill within her first 100 days of office. How can you have a candidate that 'thumbs her nose' to the American people, for people who are literally running across the border expecting to enjoy the benefits of our system, is absolutely crazy!!! I guess we should just open the gates and open up our checkbooks. Maybe, we can take care of the people trying to sneak in that are purposely trying to harm us too. There's a strong likelihood that ISIS is already slipping agents into the Syrian refugees that Obama is taking in. And the fact that somewhere around 90% of them will end up on government assistance, Hillary wants to increase that number by 500%. My question is::: How much did she really sell the US of A for?????If you want to read up anymore on Hillary before placing your 'vote' and you want the truth, then Wikileaks explains her position best. Stay away from CNN, WaPo, Huffington..... basically ANY MEDIA!!! Again, I HOPE that I'm wrong then we can finally move forward and make America Great Again. GOD BLESS US ALL!!!#HILLARYMUSTNOTWIN#notogary#notojill#donaldtrumpforprez#makeamericagreatagain#orangeisthenewblack ;)

I am wholeheartedly disappointed at how biased the news really is these days. Yet that is something y'all are supposed to NOT be. I've never seen a more unfair process of running for president in my entire life & it's mostly because of news stations/media like you manipulating the information people receive! The coverage of Hillary was basically highlights - a glimmer of grace all over it. You could've been fair & done the same for Donald, but NOT at all, you had to show your BIASED opinions by showing all the worst lowlights you could show. I am so fed up with the news these days....I may just stop watching altogether. Especially CBS This Morning. I am a 48 yr old wife & mother of 4, one having special needs & have come even come through Stage 2 breast cancer victoriously - doing my best to contribute to our society & have hardly said a word to the news about anything because I'm not a fan of complaints. Just wanted to let you how truly blatant & obvious the bias is nowadays. ~Dusti in Frisco, TX

All that we have so far is polling, which shows likely voters to favor Hillary Clinton by six or seven percent, nationwide.  That means that in  the popular vote, he can't win. In the electoral vote, there is no path to 270. He can't win. Eric Trump is just trying to get in some recognition-time for his own political aspirations after this is done.

1 | Jerry Stewart | 41 | 10154054370670950_10154054377065950 | These stories are so planted by a corrupt media. As for the Clinton's, You can't destroy evidence while under investigation. That alone is criminal, moreover it's circumstantial that she did that, do lawyers would have field day. It should have gone to trial. Theres no crime because she's being protected and the government won't press charges or send this to trial. Dont be na√Øve.
2 | Brandi Whitford-Turnage | 35 | 10154054370670950_10154054393480950 | Wake up America, Christians!! Not that I'm Trumps #1 fan but it's a sad day in America that we even have to worry about who will win this election. I stand firm on my morals, character and religious beliefs and although I don't approve of all of Trumps comments, etc. I still choose HIM! My brain can't even process everything Hillary stands for and never will! No one is perfect by any means and definitely not him, but IF we want America back, we MUST VOTE TRUMP! Praying for our country. üôèüèºüá∫üá∏We will be voting for Trump today. Our number ONE reason is because he is the only person running who seems to value the life of an unborn child and to me, that is enough in itself.However, besides pro life, he is pro police, pro 2nd amendment, pro military, and pro business. All of which I support. I will not debate anyone on this so if you do not agree, it is a free country (so far). If you do not plan to vote or are undecided then please take a minute to read this.....Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald J. Trump for President

I grew up seeing honest ,open news, you have gone down to a new low. We do not care who you are for or against ,you have no right to be that bias!!!
4 | Catherine Day Sonenberg | 0 | 10154054370670950_10154054478520950 | Let the games begin!!This post is for the 'undecided' out there as well as to those that are saying, "I'm writing in", "I'm not voting" and "I'm picking someone other than the Top 2". This is a YUUUGE Election. We are forced to pick the 'lesser of two evils'. This is due to the fact that we didn't get to hear from the Libertarian and Green Party candidates in the Debates. We might actually have found compelling candidates to vote for, if the American people spoke up (if it wasn't for their low support %'s) If Trump ran as an Independent as I wish he had done, then maybe there could have been a Republican, 3rd option. Though I've said it many times and I still stand by it,  our next President has already been selected and for ALL the WRONG reasons. I'll leave it at that but I'm hoping that there was a chance that I'm wrong about our Political System. I'm voting for my life. I'm voting for my money. I'm voting for the benefit and the well-being for my Family. This is why YOU should do the same and vote for Donald J. Trump!!!!- "LOCK HER UP" Hillary Clinton DESERVES to go to jail and should NOT have been able to run for the Presidency for the simple fact of being caught LYING; aside from having SO many other questionable charges against her. When you have someone who has a track record of behaving with an "I'm above the law" mentality and then make her President, what message does it send to the rest of the country? How should we trust a woman (person) who doesn't even deserve to have a security clearance as President?- Another thing to know about Hillary Clinton---- she is corrupt to the core!!!! If she becomes President, the US government will be controlled by the corrupt, "Pay-to-Play", money laundering Clinton Foundation. She started this when Bill was in office and continued on as Secretary of State. Do you really think these people really wanted to hear Bill speak? Please.... They paid him by giving ENORMOUS sums of money and large gifts to the Foundation. That's UNETHICAL by every meaning of the word which further proves that the Clinton's were receiving outright BRIBES. But again, Hillary is untouchable!!- Since the death of Scalia, Obama has been unable to select his replacement. Thank You SJC. It will be considered after the election. This bodes well because 3 of the current judges are 'up there in age' and Ginsburg has once stated that she would retire. She has since taken it back. But what if, WHAT IF, I said, she's waiting for Hillary to WIN? Well, if she retires, that can be another 2 open seats for the Democrats to fill. If that happens, well.... Just imagine. SCARY!!!!- There were more than 600 emailed requests for HELP, military support and added Security for Benghazi. 4 Americans are dead because ALL those requests had been ignored. Hillary has also helped create the Iranian nuclear deal, in which we gave $1.7 Billion to an anti-American nation to get nuclear weapons. Despite the fact that we are a nation it's most likely to use them on, the fun fact that it will create a new nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Was this a "penalty/fine" for the Drone that crashed in Iran not too long ago??? After all, it's interesting that they too are a terrorist supporting nation.- Hillary wants to reward illegal immigrants by granting them American citizenship because she feels that our borders are secure. She is also promising an amnesty Bill within her first 100 days of office. How can you have a candidate that 'thumbs her nose' to the American people, for people who are literally running across the border expecting to enjoy the benefits of our system, is absolutely crazy!!! I guess we should just open the gates and open up our checkbooks. Maybe, we can take care of the people trying to sneak in that are purposely trying to harm us too. There's a strong likelihood that ISIS is already slipping agents into the Syrian refugees that Obama is taking in. And the fact that somewhere around 90% of them will end up on government assistance, Hillary wants to increase that number by 500%. My question is::: How much did she really sell the US of A for?????If you want to read up anymore on Hillary before placing your 'vote' and you want the truth, then Wikileaks explains her position best. Stay away from CNN, WaPo, Huffington..... basically ANY MEDIA!!! Again, I HOPE that I'm wrong then we can finally move forward and make America Great Again. GOD BLESS US ALL!!!#HILLARYMUSTNOTWIN#notogary#notojill#donaldtrumpforprez#makeamericagreatagain#orangeisthenewblack ;)

REMEMBER BREXIT..The USA is about to see a repeat tonight..:-)
7 | Dee Turner | 2 | 10154054370670950_10154054546805950 | SHE is a lying treacherous traitorous manipulative rape enabling UN American criminal career politician who after 30+ years riding Bills ?tails has achieved nothing except to become wealth illegally on the backs of the poor.
8 | Nikki Boatright-Scott | 2 | 10154054370670950_10154054414715950 | How about that. She's human and has a sense of humor. Meanwhile the Republican nominee has a court case for fraud and a court case for child rape coming up. If his shoes were on her feet you people would crucify her, but for him it's OK. smh.....
9 | Maria Perez | 4 | 10154054370670950_10154054372135950 | I'm all about live and let live. But this is getting crazy! For example, I have a friend who gets about $800 a month in social security. Her spouse can't work at this time, and his monthly insurance premium is jumping from @ $230 per month to about $750 per month. If she didn't take on a part time job, that would leave them with less than $50 a month to live on. So while the wealthy celebrities are stumping for Clinton, and the people on subsidized health care are voting for Clinton, the people who have worked all of their lives, and those of us in the middle class are getting screwed. I've seen people's names changed because they bought a new social security card illegally, I've been to the richest cities in the country with people sleeping on the sidewalks, I've been called racist because I don't agree with this administration, I've seen towers fall, and I've seen my hometown county turn into the 2nd most affected by meth and heroin in NY state, (of which Clinton was a Senator). I've watched videos of Clinton saying she was against gay marriage, that she was for a border wall, called young black men "super predators" and her outright lies about a little place called Benghazi. As I've said before, I don't know if Trump is the answer, but this woman, with all of the opportunity she has had to affect change, is definitely not the answer. She walked into Washington 40 plus years ago with the sole purpose to gain the Presidency. It's been about her the entire time. Kicked off the Watergate case for taking home documents, lying under oath, and the most recent admission of accepting an unreported gift of 1 million dollars from a foreign nation (that which you need to report). They left Haiti, still in ruins. This woman can't even wear an American flag pin, as to not offend her foreign counterparts. This is not the America my ancestors came here for. Scared to speak your mind, less control over your children's upbringing, and a new database with your private healthcare information going straight to the government. All true. All evidence based in fact. When Tuesday is over, one way or another it's gonna be scary. I just hope. I don't know what I hope. But I'm gonna have a back up plan.Trump 2016
10 | Nancy Sieleman | 1 | 10154054370670950_10154054376790950 | Today is the day ... not even sure if there is really a winner, many are voting for the lesser of the evil's, not because it was the best person out of millions of Americans. The nuke codes were brought up like candy, lots of fear. We were feared about war with Russia, yet neither mentioned Russia is our PERMANENT ally in UN Security Council. The more I heard they were going to create massive jobs for Americans, the more I thought they were telling us war, which is a massive job creator, but over the decades ... also breaking down our family structures. I will continue my silent protest by voting by not voting, which is not a vote for Hillary or Trump. Hopefully our kids will forgive the political parties for becoming an absurd reality show, seen around the world, part comedy, part horror show.
11 | David H Craig | 2 | 10154054370670950_10154054533210950 | Start reporting the truth, Hillary has no credibility, Regardless of what Hillary Clinton says she is still under investigation by the FBI, one by the Public Corruption Group the other by the National Security Group.

Hillary Clinton is corrupted along with president Obama . These people do not have good judgement. America is suffering because of these kind of people. These  people are Career politicians. That's all they know what to do. They have been in politics all their lives. They don't know what you need for your family and your family's future and the future of America.They don't know what you need to be happy and the happiness of your family. They love to be in power. Hillary got rich by being in politics. I believe these people never had a real job. My fellow Americans don't vote for this kind of people. I love you, may God bless you and may God bless The United States of America.

23 | Leo Decaj | 2 | 10154054370670950_10154054382895950 | Keep this in mind before you Vote please .Donald Trump did not steal your money. Donald Trump did not raise your taxes. Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food. Trump is not stirring a race war. Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims. Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda. Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East. Trump did not betray Israel. Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. Trump did not cripple our economy. Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars. Trump did not ruin our credit, twice. Trump did not double African American unemployment. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans. Trump did not set free all of terrorists in Guantanamo bay. Trump did not steal your rights, violate US Constitutional law, or commit treason, hundreds of times. Yet Trump is being ripped apart in the news, non stop. Barrack Hussein Obama, Hillary Clinton and the criminals occupying our government, are not. The media is the Democratic Party. Save our culture. Stop listening to them..!!

5 | Victor Bare II | 2 | 10154054318015950_10154054365845950 | There is a big difference in Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Clinton wants to flood America hundreds of thousands (550,000+) of the same barbaric shariah law believing savages currently destroying EVERY host county gracious and ignorant enough to try and help these satan worshipers - oops, I mean their 'god' allah worshipers.  Why do you think that these same muslim savages will come here to America - The Great Western Devil - and follow our laws and constitution when they have never done it anywhere else on earth?? They set up barbaric shariah law in every host country when they get large numbers. There are muslim shariah law areas in every host country around the world where the host country's own police and other law enforcement will not go because of the brutal savage behaviors of the muslims and their 'religion of peace' which is nothing more than an evil social and government  ideology.  It's a Trojan horse slow invasion of America so they can destroy us from the inside. Vote for open borders where hundreds of thousand of immigrants and illegals can come and go as they please driving down the American worker's wages and taking jobs from Americans which will destroy businesses like yours when no one can afford to buy anything you are selling. Trying to claim some 'moral high ground' and saying "I'm voting for Johnson or Stein because I'm not voting for Donald Trump my conscience just won't let me" is an absurd delusion. A vote for any candidate other than Trump is a vote for Hillary Clinton - period. So all of you sad safe space PC people out there who think your little 'moral stance' or this meme means something, don't worry the rest of America with a brain and who aren't so blinded by our own prejudices and hate will vote for Trump and save America from the destructive policies and corruption of Hillary Clinton. Just go back into your safe space so Trump's mean politically incorrect WORDS won't hurt you anymore. Pop a nerve pill, smoke a joint, drink a beer or 10 or have a bottle of wine to numb the bitterness of your hate and curl up in your crybaby safe space and watch the bed hoping, adulterous, lying characters of  Grey's Anatomy, Scandal or whatever soap opera floats your boat and hang on to the 'moral outrage' you spew out in your blissful ignorance of the fact this is no ordinary election. This is good vs evil. The rest of America will stop Hillary Clinton from destroying the 2nd Amendment taking away our right to defend ourselves and our families and communities and our country and we will stop her from filing the Supreme Court with more Godless immoral justices and we will stop her from legalizing the murderous practice of Late Term Abortion and we will stop her from her dreams of open borders and a one world government - you know all the things any real sane legal American should want to protect and stop - esp. anyone claiming to be a Christian. God doesn't need a perfect person to do His Will - just a willing one. God used Cyrus to free the Jews from slavery and the Bible clearly states that Cyrus did not acknowledge God, but God knew Cyrus was a good fair leader and businessman who would set His people free and lead them back to Christ and rebuild Israel to her former glory.  God is going to use baby Christian President Donald Trump and his faithful, unapologetic Christian Vice President Mike Pence to turn America and the world around for His good and His will. #TRUMP2016

Why would the same countries that sponsor TERRORISM sponsor HRC, do you think it may have something to do with her stance on letting 3/4 million refugees from Syria which we can not vet properly, their whole goal is to get people in positions where they can commit Jihad, that's what they invest in they want to hasten the coming of their messiah, if you care about your country and its not racist to put America first, it's just common sense.
16 | Bryan Dale | 0 | 10154054318015950_10154054498935950 | It's just amazing to me as I've read numerous comments over the past year or so about today's presidential election, how so many people are cavalierly treating this like a sporting event. Like they're only rooting for their favorite team or athlete, instead of voting on many very important issues that will change millions of people's lives. Remember folks, it's not about individuals and their personalities you may like or dislike. This presidential election is about the course this country will take for the next 4 years. It's serious business if we do not turn this country back to the God given values that made her special to begin with.Forget for a moment if you will about this charismatic leader or that person that's rough around the edges. What's important is not how polished their speeches are or how many times they misspoke. We need to be focused on the issues they're acually supporting or opposing, for we've been counseled to vote on issues, not personalities. We should be doing our part to elect Godly servants that will uphold and promote His priorities, not our own, for those are the everlasting values this great nation was founded upon.

17 | Lena Persson | 0 | 10154054318015950_10154054402970950 | I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump.

1 | Derrick Obeng Benson | 17 | 10154054301965950_10154054307850950 | Obama played his race card, Hillary's playing her woman card, so Americans are now playing their Trump card.The mainstream media & the political establishment decided that it's Hillary Clinton's "turn" to be President. But the American people get the final say & tonight, they will stop her. #TrumpForPresident
2 | L Ann Myers Lovelady | 0 | 10154054301965950_10154054516630950 | Luke 8:17 For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.
3 | Victor Bare II | 5 | 10154054301965950_10154054366375950 | There is a big difference in Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Clinton wants to flood America hundreds of thousands (550,000+) of the same barbaric shariah law believing savages currently destroying EVERY host county gracious and ignorant enough to try and help these satan worshipers - oops, I mean their 'god' allah worshipers.  Why do you think that these same muslim savages will come here to America - The Great Western Devil - and follow our laws and constitution when they have never done it anywhere else on earth?? They set up barbaric shariah law in every host country when they get large numbers. There are muslim shariah law areas in every host country around the world where the host country's own police and other law enforcement will not go because of the brutal savage behaviors of the muslims and their 'religion of peace' which is nothing more than an evil social and government  ideology.  It's a Trojan horse slow invasion of America so they can destroy us from the inside. Vote for open borders where hundreds of thousand of immigrants and illegals can come and go as they please driving down the American worker's wages and taking jobs from Americans which will destroy businesses like yours when no one can afford to buy anything you are selling. Trying to claim some 'moral high ground' and saying "I'm voting for Johnson or Stein because I'm not voting for Donald Trump my conscience just won't let me" is an absurd delusion. A vote for any candidate other than Trump is a vote for Hillary Clinton - period. So all of you sad safe space PC people out there who think your little 'moral stance' or this meme means something, don't worry the rest of America with a brain and who aren't so blinded by our own prejudices and hate will vote for Trump and save America from the destructive policies and corruption of Hillary Clinton. Just go back into your safe space so Trump's mean politically incorrect WORDS won't hurt you anymore. Pop a nerve pill, smoke a joint, drink a beer or 10 or have a bottle of wine to numb the bitterness of your hate and curl up in your crybaby safe space and watch the bed hoping, adulterous, lying characters of  Grey's Anatomy, Scandal or whatever soap opera floats your boat and hang on to the 'moral outrage' you spew out in your blissful ignorance of the fact this is no ordinary election. This is good vs evil. The rest of America will stop Hillary Clinton from destroying the 2nd Amendment taking away our right to defend ourselves and our families and communities and our country and we will stop her from filing the Supreme Court with more Godless immoral justices and we will stop her from legalizing the murderous practice of Late Term Abortion and we will stop her from her dreams of open borders and a one world government - you know all the things any real sane legal American should want to protect and stop - esp. anyone claiming to be a Christian. God doesn't need a perfect person to do His Will - just a willing one. God used Cyrus to free the Jews from slavery and the Bible clearly states that Cyrus did not acknowledge God, but God knew Cyrus was a good fair leader and businessman who would set His people free and lead them back to Christ and rebuild Israel to her former glory.  God is going to use baby Christian President Donald Trump and his faithful, unapologetic Christian Vice President Mike Pence to turn America and the world around for His good and His will. #TRUMP2016

She has put national security at risk to hide her corruption in the "Clinton Foundation" Which has paid for her daughters wedding and living expenses for the past 10 years. She is married to a convicted rapist. She's not qualified to be POTUS. She hasn't done anything to earn the job within even the political world, other than be married to a guy who has achieved as president but still was disgraced with sexual scandals.

On infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice. On guerrillas by night, instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted, vasthuman and material resources, into the building of a tightly knit efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.

"Thinking about Hamilton... those people, 39 men in five months, wrote the constitution that still governs the United States of America. It took this Congress eight months to approve the funds to find a vaccine for the Zika virus. That's unacceptable," said Bob Schieffer.

4 | Dylan Hopson | 2 | 10154054192915950_10154054237175950 | It's because both sides are more interested in who can be the most radical, as opposed to legislating because actual legislating involves compromise, and that's a nasty word in government now a days.
5 | Suzanne Wright | 0 | 10154054192915950_10154054440785950 | The hate that has been spread between the party's is ridiculous. Working together and coming up with solutions with give and take is frowned on by the ever watching political parties. People who work with the other party are forced out of office. This has resulted in gridlock in government nothing important is getting done. The budget, social security, and jobs. To cover up Their in abilities, they do one investigation  after another even when they know it will be the same. This has to stop. We have to start working together again and compromising.
6 | Ryan Curtis | 0 | 10154054192915950_10154054492540950 | Hamilton and our founding fathers governed with a different standard of accountability and a different standard of openness. Things have changed so much in that regard. But I also think people used to expect their government to be compromised of actual leaders - people they could revere. We live in an age when politicians react to human behavior for the sake of electability which has prohibited us from having many, if any, true leaders. Whether we admit it or not, we want to be led. But I love what Schieffer did their - it is a great contrast.

The news media set the tone because they were desperate to make sure there chosen candidate had all the help she could get to win they new she couldn't get there on her record. We need to go back to a time where you didn't know who the news media wanted to win to where they used to be fair. With giving Clinton the debate questions to purposely not giving much time to her criminal activities which years ago would have been reported on every day. The only it thing makes you wonder is if she does become president if her friends the news media is going to keep her honest then what the hell is going to happen with her being president.

18 | James M Lowe | 1 | 10154054192915950_10154054254250950 | Issue; Don Trump efforts: Thank you Don Trump for YOUR efforts in the primaries and the election campaign, win or lose. I started out as a Hard Charging worker for Ted Cruz although, inside, I expected Scott Walker would be the primary winner and the ultimate November election winner. I voted for Ted Cruz in the Michigan primary election and the Trump Team slaughtered us. 2 weeks before the Indiana primary, figures clearly showed that Trump would win the primary and the nomination. I had to decide THEN whether to Move On to the Trump campaign and waited until the Indiana primary was done and went Full Bore to work for the Trump campaign. It was surprising to see clinton and Sanders come out for a virtual Progressive, Socialist, Communist agenda and I decided to "switch into 3rd gear" for the Trump team. It has cost me a lot of money, for my income level, I don't know exactly how much and OVER 1,000 hours of Personal Time out of My Life to work his campaign. Many times I fell asleep on my key board and had to take breaks from working the campaign and when I woke up and Came Back, I found out Trump had been working all the way through my rest time. If Mitt Romney had worked like this, 4 years ago, Don Trump would NOT have had to run for prez. I hope the Christian Evangelists will pray and vote for an election victory TODAY for Don Trump. God speed.

And it's not just CBS it's all the news stations almost it's ridiculous and unacceptable the media is a joke. I was for Sanders in the beginning until Hillary screwed him over yet he still supports her and that has lost all the respect I had for that man thank you for reporting nothing but crap all these half speeches that Trump has said you don't put the whole speech just the part that you liked grow up act like a real news station.

6 | Shawne Boring | 0 | 10154054148545950_10154054238085950 | I already voted TRUMP Today is election day. When you go out to vote today and you consider voting for Hillary Clinton. You might want to second-guess your vote. Hillary supports abortion, partial birth abortion at 8 months which is almost term. Now most of you supporters of Hillary will use the excuse that women have the right to abort a baby if they're raped and that they should have the choice to not carry a child if they are a victim of rape. However all you Hillary supporters ARE against the death penalty. Which is a bit messed up if you think about it. Because you're willing to kill an unborn baby that did nothing wrong but you will not kill the person that raped the woman getting the abortion. So I feel that if you are able to kill an unborn baby who has done nothing wrong but you are against the death penalty to kill an adult man who has killed someone or rape someone and they deserve to the death penalty for what they did, then you are just as bad as Hillary and these rapists and murderers, think about that. Not saying you have to vote for Trump just because he is the other candidate, there are other candidates as well to choose from. So, Choose Wisely. Don't choose Hillary.GET OUT AND VOTE....MAKE A DIFFERENCE....WE NEED CHANGE!!!!NOT MORE OF THE SAME...

Then go find people who need help getting to a poll, and get them out to vote. I've made no secret of my preferences in this election, but you won't hear any partisan comments from me today. This is the most important American election in modern history, and the key to healing the wounds created by both parties in this electoral campaign is to start the next presidency with a clear decision by the electorate. Good luck!  #GetOutTheVote

Every time a woman has a late term abortion, the babies blood is on your hands! When Isis arrives with refugees and murders Americans, those innocent Americans blood is on your hands! When more Americans jobs move to another country, it would be your fault! When our countries debt rises to the point where there's civil unrest, ALL the bloodshed is on your hands! Voting for someone to be your president is not a game! Is not about who has a better chance of winning, but someone who will fight for our security, civil liberties, freedom and respect the law of the land, the (U.S. Constitution), someone who would put the people first before anything! Picking someone to be your president basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin is not only stupidity, but racist!

12 | Klaus Reck | 0 | 10154054148545950_10154054197680950 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are ‚Äúmorons,‚Äù ‚Äúidiots,‚Äù ‚Äúimbeciles,‚Äù ‚Äúhuman weeds,‚Äù and ‚Äúmisfits.‚Äù Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump

14 | Sydney Nichols | 0 | 10154054148545950_10154054202740950 | America is at a crossroads, If you are considering writing in a name or voting 3rd party, America is in JEOPARDY! Todays electionSome people have brought up the fact that they won't vote if the eventual nominee is not the person they want. I just want to put something in perspective. Justice Scalia's seat is vacant. Ginsberg is 82 years old Kennedy is 79 Breyer is 77 Thomas is 67.Nowadays, the data shows that the average age of a Supreme Court retirement or death occurs after 75.These are 5 vacancies that will likely come up over the next 4-8 years.The next President will have the power to potentially create a 7-2 Supreme Court skewed in their ideology. Think about that  7-2.If the next President appoints 5 young justices, it will****guarantee control of the Supreme Court for an entire generation. And 7-2 decisions will hold up much more over time than 5-4 decisions which are viewed as lacking in mandate. Hillary has made it clear she will use the Supreme Court to go after the 2nd Amendment. She has literally said that the Supreme Court was wrong in its Heller decision stating that the Court should overturn and remove the individual right to keep and bear arms. Period. Anyone and Everyone who is saying that they won't vote for one candidate or the other if they are the GOP nominee, please realize this. Hear this! If Hillary Clinton wins and gets to make these appointments, you likely will never see another conservative victory at the Supreme Court level for the rest of your life.Ever.Whoever is the GOP  nominee, go VOTE for the GOP Nominee! Remember Romney?Three million conservatives who had voted for McCain did not cast a vote for Romney (for whatever reason and the result was four additional years of B.H.O.) AND ONE FINAL THOUGHT, Hillary''s already on the record as saying that her buddy, B.H.O. "would make a great Supreme Court Justice."  DID YOU JUST READ THAT LAST SENTENCE?  NOW ARE YOU SCARED?I am not crazy about either candidate, but I look at it this way, our freedoms, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to bear arms, which candidate will protect those freedoms or which one will put those freedoms in jeopardy?  Who is pro life? Who has been successful financially?  Who hasn't lied to the American people about Benghazi?  Who hasn't lied to the American people about 30,000 emails?  The list of questions goes on and on, and at the end of the day, it is like Rick and Bubba put it, vote for flawed or evil?  I simply cannot vote for evil. If I choose to stay home or write in someone, it is a vote for Hillary. Crazy messed up system, but that is what we get as an American voter. So for this gal I will take flawed Trump!From that standpoint, on the vote your conscience, I understand, totally. An American with a clear conscience simply cannot vote for Hillary, that is an oxymoron!Hilkary has the SAME AGENDA as Obama to destroy America. Hillary took $$$ from both domestic & foreign donors, Hillary OWES them...think about it!  Copy and paste and SHARE with everyone you know that America is in JEOPARDY!
15 | Colleen Marie | 0 | 10154054148545950_10154054175540950 | If nothing else sticks in your thoughts remember this one thing before the polls end tomorrow: VOTE and don't listen to the pollsters. Many of the polls come from the Main Stream Media and those polls are SKEWED to either get you to vote for Hillary or figure Trump is losing (so why vote....get you to stay home). Make YOUR VOICE heard regardless of those damn polls and VOTE. There are lots of undecideds among us.....that is who the polls are trying to 'grab' with their numbers. Don't let anyone steal what is yours to decide.

I am heartbroken that so many people would rather stay ignorant to the truth and blindly follow Hilary and not read ONE DAMN EMAIL that was leaked!!! How can you love America & continue to support a woman who has sold our country out?!? HOW?!? This election has uncovered a lot of truth & so have these LEAKED EMAILS:: TRUTH that Hilary broke the law by having a server & having TOP SECRET, CLASSIFIED Information on her server; which she used BleachBit to wipe clean (not with a cloth!); Hilary had 13 devices (not one for convenience like she lied about) & confessed to smashing them with a hammer; she told the FBI that she didn't remember what Classified meant; that Hilary will LIE TO YOUR FACE while you bury your child that she helped kill in Benghazi; Hilary hates Catholics, Gays, Arabs, Bernie Supporters & blacks (those super predators); Obama made sure the FBI didn't indite Hilary & emailed her knowing she had a private email account-(proving he also broke the law & KNEW she was breaking the law!); had Bill Clinton secretly meet with the DOJ Loretta Lynch on the airport Tarmac which was NOT about discussing grandchildren for over 30 minutes; the State department tried to BRIBE the FBI to Declassify some of Hilary's emails; the DNC rigged the system & stole the election from Bernie; tried to ruin Trump with sexual allegations that couldn't be denounced and proven false in time before the election- KNOWING that such allegations would be harmful even though they were NOT TRUE & that she tried to destroy the women who made sexual assault allegations about her husband; the democrat party has set up people to fight at Trump rallies and to incite violence & have PAID THEM TO DO SO; Dead Democrats are voting & George Soros (who OWNS Hilary) is linked to voting machines in 16 states that have major electoral college counts; Hilary & Bill have sold out our country for MILLIONS of dollars to Countries that SHE KNEW WERE FUNDING ISIS!!!! How in the hell can you support the continued corruption in our government?!? If Hilary wins there will be NOTHING nor No branch of government to stop her!!! She has already proven that!!! Please take off your Republican & Democrat hat & start thinking like an American!!! This country is on her knees, with her head bent down and Hilary is holding the killing sword!!!! For the love of God----WAKE UP!!!!

I want my daughters, grandchildren, great grandchildren and generations to have a first woman president as one they can be proud to see in the history books not riddled with scandals and corruption. I hope the people of our great country feel the same and keep Hillary Clinton out of the White House. Lets be proud of our history 10-20-30-40...years up the road and not have any regrets.

She has put national security at risk to hide her corruption in the "Clinton Foundation" Which has paid for her daughters wedding and living expenses for the past 10 years. She is married to a convicted rapist. She's not qualified to be POTUS. She hasn't done anything to earn the job within even the political world, other than be married to a guy who has achieved as president but still was disgraced with sexual scandals.

2 | William Calabrese | 74 | 10154054102050950_10154054119340950 | As Americans, we are tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. And let's Make America Great Again!
3 | Sonya Walston | 36 | 10154054102050950_10154054123605950 | All those police officers and secret service and no one arrests her. Their tongues must hurt from having to bite them for how they really feel about her.
4 | Kirk Lazaris | 33 | 10154054102050950_10154054129485950 | Great treasonous criminals voting for themselves smh If clinton wins she will pass TPP, then America really wont have any jobs for legal Americans to work to make a livable wage, since we're going to have to compete against illegal aliens for employment after clinton grants amnesty to people who broke the law to come to this country. America's economy is doomed if clinton wins.

9 | Patti Ann Bone | 1 | 10154054102050950_10154054538155950 | Hillary operates above the law and is the most corrupt politician this nation has allowed to continue on with her crime spree. Her and her sexual predator impeached husband Bill will hopefully be stopped by the American people today. Enough is enough.
10 | Roy Jordan | 3 | 10154054102050950_10154054271785950 | The Clintons, live in a convenient location for their operation. A town where the median family income is over $180K, and the population is 92% white. But they are going to help all the minorities in America because they are sympathetic to their problems. Get a pen and paper and write down all the benefits that you receive from another Clinton presidency. It shouldn't take too long.
11 | Charlene Thomas Searson | 4 | 10154054102050950_10154054263430950 | Look at all the people around her taking pictures and filming. I thought that wasn't aloud since Justin timberlake got in big trouble posting a picture?

This is the most important American election in modern history, and the key to healing the wounds created by both parties in this electoral campaign is to start the next presidency with a clear decision by the electorate.

25 | Klaus Reck | 4 | 10154054102050950_10154054198275950 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are ‚Äúmorons,‚Äù ‚Äúidiots,‚Äù ‚Äúimbeciles,‚Äù ‚Äúhuman weeds,‚Äù and ‚Äúmisfits.‚Äù Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump

2 | Andrea Leska Delair | 109 | 10154054085325950_10154054088590950 | ya billions for her family and foundation that pays for her daughters wedding etc.. , wall street shes so corrupt, they will loose their money in all the places they have it, and her people she has in her pocket and who paid to be in her pocket !! lmao
3 | John Yaws | 83 | 10154054085325950_10154054109380950 | Explain to me how women can vote for Clinton when she has a performer who does a concert at her campaign rally calling them the B word and blacks the N word and wanting to grab women by the C word and Hillary smiling and clapping and thanking him for his fine performance , how is this a women's rights activist and not double standard ? How can any woman vote for her after she is praising this behavior after claiming to be against it ?
4 | Trish Marie Charlton-Lee | 51 | 10154054085325950_10154054092750950 | I am not a political person and have never been but this is the most important election of Our Lives. For us our kids grandchildren and future grandchildren. Please be mindful when voting. Look for obvious signs of voter fraud as dead people have been voting in your ballots are being changed when you vote. If you don't believe me check out the segment on 6abc where are loved ones who have passed were visited because their loved ones who have passed voted. Also Take into consideration those people who cannot afford Healthcare but very unaffordable Healthcare is being forced down their throat. And don't forget that if they don't take that said Healthcare and have a job they get penalized in their taxes. A minimum of $2,400 is what is lost to that person can I already afford this. A Hillary vote will be nothing but the same. And the same people who cannot afford Healthcare come 2017 will end up paying way more whether they like it or have it. Do not let the corrupt media sway you. They are only telling you what they are paid to tell you. Which is already been proven buy CNN when Hillary was given the questions during the debates. The Obama and Clinton administration is so corrupt. They have constantly lied to the American people and the Clinton administration has stolen taken money from other countries that want to kill us and they do not respect women or gays. They have taken money in exchange for favors from Big Banks big corporations etc. They have used a fake foundation That was supposed to be for good to line their own pockets. This is also been proven by WikiLeaks as they have used it for their daughter's wedding. The money that was supposed to go to Haiti only very little percent went there and the rest went in their pockets. Hillary Clinton has lied to the FBI and the American people during both investigations. The only way the American people found anything out was through WikiLeaks. Had we not had WikiLeaks we would all still be in the dark and would believe that she would be fit for president. She lied and claimed that the Russians were responsible for the leaks in our own private server which was illegal to have in the first place . She lied about her server. Obama lied about knowing about her server. And they both compromise National Security. 5 of America's enemies hack into her server which can put us all in danger. She and Obama paid off and bribed top officials that made it totally impossible for there to be any chance of her being indicted. Whistleblowers are turning up dead left and right under suspicious reasons. Hell she couldn't even be honest when it came to her stealing the White House Furniture that she inevitably had to return LOL. I could keep going but I think I made my point. Do we really want this unfit unethical irresponsible Woman for president? is this what you want for the future of your children?I personally don't care who you vote for as long as it is #neverhillary. Vote for Trump vote for the third party but never Hillary. She is the disease that is going to drain this country. It is going to be more of the same if she is elected. Nothing but corruption and the American people will never be informed of anything unless of course WikiLeaks she's putting her out on Front Street. Which God I hope they still do . And if he is elected president I will bet my bottom dollar that she will be impeached just like her husband was. Please be wise when voting for the future of my kids your kids and our grandchildren. #neverhillary #anybodybutHillaryforpresident #nomorecorruption #onlywecanstopthecorruption

Because they're using their hatred to cloud their judgement. Everybody needs to know with all what's going on in the world, specially with the Russians.

13 | Brian Lee | 7 | 10154054085325950_10154054127325950 | Even if this bitch does win the fact that Trump stayed right up there with her proves how truly worthless media has been. With all the negativity venom you media whores have spit out this year, she should be 50 points ahead.
14 | Harriet Hill | 3 | 10154054085325950_10154054107690950 | I love to see the pride and love on Bill and Chelsea's faces. I hope all the anger and hatred will simmer down now.

16 | Hilary Milo Campbell | 0 | 10154054085325950_10154054152860950 | Today's the day. Vote. Just get out and vote. Then make sure your family votes. And everyone you know votes. Then go find people who need help getting to a poll, and get them out to vote. I've made no secret of my preferences in this election, but you won't hear any partisan comments from me today. This is the most important American election in modern history, and the key to healing the wounds created by both parties in this electoral campaign is to start the next presidency with a clear decision by the electorate. Good luck!  #GetOutTheVote
17 | Tyson Long | 2 | 10154054085325950_10154054370145950 | I just watched a video where Hillary Clinton called Jay-Z and Beyonce role models and the American dream?????Are you kidding me? I'm telling you folks if this woman wins it's the end of this fucking country as we know it. Don't believe me watch.
18 | David C. Nasworthy | 0 | 10154054085325950_10154054561885950 | Yeah the markets been falling for a week because the media has been touting a Clinton win. Wait til Trump wins by a landslide. Not only will the market go way up, we will finally be able to consign this network and several others to the tabloid isle, so no one will take them seriously again.
19 | Teralie McCabe | 1 | 10154054085325950_10154054582005950 | Lol. That's because she is and has always been in bed with wall street!  Of course they want her to win!  Means more moola in their pockets!   She will and has sold us to the highest bidder!!
20 | Miralda Gutierrez | 1 | 10154054085325950_10154054441620950 | They both suck to be running for presidency,  ones a lair and the other has no experience what's so ever,  this country will turn to shit either way who gets it!!
21 | Catherine Day Sonenberg | 3 | 10154054085325950_10154054227360950 | Let the games begin!!This post is for the 'undecided' out there as well as to those that are saying, "I'm writing in", "I'm not voting" and "I'm picking someone other than the Top 2". This is a YUUUGE Election. We are forced to pick the 'lesser of two evils'. This is due to the fact that we didn't get to hear from the Libertarian and Green Party candidates in the Debates. We might actually have found compelling candidates to vote for, if the American people spoke up (if it wasn't for their low support %'s) If Trump ran as an Independent as I wish he had done, then maybe there could have been a Republican, 3rd option. Though I've said it many times and I still stand by it,  our next President has already been selected and for ALL the WRONG reasons. I'll leave it at that but I'm hoping that there was a chance that I'm wrong about our Political System. I'm voting for my life. I'm voting for my money. I'm voting for the benefit and the well-being for my Family. This is why YOU should do the same and vote for Donald J. Trump!!!!- "LOCK HER UP" Hillary Clinton DESERVES to go to jail and should NOT have been able to run for the Presidency for the simple fact of being caught LYING; aside from having SO many other questionable charges against her. When you have someone who has a track record of behaving with an "I'm above the law" mentality and then make her President, what message does it send to the rest of the country? How should we trust a woman (person) who doesn't even deserve to have a security clearance as President?- Another thing to know about Hillary Clinton---- she is corrupt to the core!!!! If she becomes President, the US government will be controlled by the corrupt, "Pay-to-Play", money laundering Clinton Foundation. She started this when Bill was in office and continued on as Secretary of State. Do you really think these people really wanted to hear Bill speak? Please.... They paid him by giving ENORMOUS sums of money and large gifts to the Foundation. That's UNETHICAL by every meaning of the word which further proves that the Clinton's were receiving outright BRIBES. But again, Hillary is untouchable!!- Since the death of Scalia, Obama has been unable to select his replacement. Thank You SJC. It will be considered after the election. This bodes well because 3 of the current judges are 'up there in age' and Ginsburg has once stated that she would retire. She has since taken it back. But what if, WHAT IF, I said, she's waiting for Hillary to WIN? Well, if she retires, that can be another 2 open seats for the Democrats to fill. If that happens, well.... Just imagine. SCARY!!!!- There were more than 600 emailed requests for HELP, military support and added Security for Benghazi. 4 Americans are dead because ALL those requests had been ignored. Hillary has also helped create the Iranian nuclear deal, in which we gave $1.7 Billion to an anti-American nation to get nuclear weapons. Despite the fact that we are a nation it's most likely to use them on, the fun fact that it will create a new nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Was this a "penalty/fine" for the Drone that crashed in Iran not too long ago??? After all, it's interesting that they too are a terrorist supporting nation.- Hillary wants to reward illegal immigrants by granting them American citizenship because she feels that our borders are secure. She is also promising an amnesty Bill within her first 100 days of office. How can you have a candidate that 'thumbs her nose' to the American people, for people who are literally running across the border expecting to enjoy the benefits of our system, is absolutely crazy!!! I guess we should just open the gates and open up our checkbooks. Maybe, we can take care of the people trying to sneak in that are purposely trying to harm us too. There's a strong likelihood that ISIS is already slipping agents into the Syrian refugees that Obama is taking in. And the fact that somewhere around 90% of them will end up on government assistance, Hillary wants to increase that number by 500%. My question is::: How much did she really sell the US of A for?????If you want to read up anymore on Hillary before placing your 'vote' and you want the truth, then Wikileaks explains her position best. Stay away from CNN, WaPo, Huffington..... basically ANY MEDIA!!! Again, I HOPE that I'm wrong then we can finally move forward and make America Great Again. GOD BLESS US ALL!!!#HILLARYMUSTNOTWIN#notogary#notojill#donaldtrumpforprez#makeamericagreatagain#orangeisthenewblack ;)

23 | Gary Olson | 0 | 10154054085325950_10154054651040950 | On Global TV News in Calgary (Alberta,Canada) this morning an election poll shows that more than two-thirds of Canadians favour Hillary over Trump.  There are almost as many undecided as Trump supporters.
24 | Robert Phelan | 1 | 10154054085325950_10154054320885950 | The idiots on Fox Business don't understand what is going on with the economy at all. The uncertainty of a Trump Administration is driving the markets, just as the uncertainty of a Clinton Administration to be fair. With Trump there is no clear cut plan on how he is going to cut taxes and and what he is going to deregulate. That is why there is so much panic in the markets. With Hillary the markets can predict that her plan will be status quo. So logically the Trump Administration is going to be a huge cost on the economy.
25 | Renita Kruger | 0 | 10154054085325950_10154054335755950 | To me the choice is clear: someone that used a private email server and has been investigated for years with investigations rendering no proof of wrong doing or a man who had six bankruptcies, wants to give tax breaks for the rich, does not believe in global warming, denies saying things that he said on tape, makes up conspiracies, has as his campaign CEO a leader of the Alt Right movement - who has run a news site that believes the holocaust did not happen and other racist neo-nazi propaganda-, who has been endorsed by the kkk and other white supremacist groups, who bullied disabled, women, immigrants, blacks, Latinos and others, who is a compulsive liar, is ignorant by all measures, threatens anyone who opposes him, has been accused of sexual molestation by several women and has bragged on tape about being a sexual predator, has not shown his taxes because what is in there would show something he does not want people to see, who defrauded thousands of people with TrumpU and other business, wants to deregulate wall street,  shows signs of personality disorder! Hillary is smart, prepared, sane, will fight against global warming, help students, keep marriage equality, keep women rights to choose, and equal pay for equal work!

Racism, nationalism and xenophobia are all hallmarks of fascism.. Of course, u have to be a student of history and intelligent enough to see it.. Such a tool he is.. Not sure if Eric is Beavis or Butthead..
2 | Gary Basham | 110 | 10154054043075950_10154054063375950 | The president does not control the budget or spending that would be the republican majority congress. Why do these idiots always blame the debt on the POTUS?
3 | Carmen Nys | 117 | 10154054043075950_10154054049530950 | Well‚Ä¶ the first female president should be someone to be proud of, not a woman who cheated and lied.

Anyone, anyone, who supports him is as racist, xenophobic, & as uninformed as he is. #wewontgoback. #jimcrowisover

8 | Holly Sawyer | 22 | 10154054043075950_10154054067625950 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.REASONS TO NOT VOTE HILLARY‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible?

(Because people don't die if they pray, silly goose)Thousands of children starved to death because they didn't want to eat vegetables in school, (thanks Michelle Obama) and their lazy ass parents didn't send lunch boxes full of candyThousands of dead teenagers who were vaccinated against deadly diseases (instead of just praying the sickness away) by evil scientists working for the New World OrderThe thousands of white folks slaughtered by immigrants as they poured across our borders. Like that white guy in SC who had a woman chained in a box last week with several bodies buried on his property. Pretty sure he was an illegal alien from Slovenia
5 | Klaus Reck | 0 | 10154054020410950_10154054199985950 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are ‚Äúmorons,‚Äù ‚Äúidiots,‚Äù ‚Äúimbeciles,‚Äù ‚Äúhuman weeds,‚Äù and ‚Äúmisfits.‚Äù Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump

9 | Sydney Nichols | 0 | 10154054020410950_10154054213670950 | America is at a crossroads, If you are considering writing in a name or voting 3rd party, America is in JEOPARDY! Todays electionSome people have brought up the fact that they won't vote if the eventual nominee is not the person they want. I just want to put something in perspective. Justice Scalia's seat is vacant. Ginsberg is 82 years old Kennedy is 79 Breyer is 77 Thomas is 67.Nowadays, the data shows that the average age of a Supreme Court retirement or death occurs after 75.These are 5 vacancies that will likely come up over the next 4-8 years.The next President will have the power to potentially create a 7-2 Supreme Court skewed in their ideology. Think about that  7-2.If the next President appoints 5 young justices, it will****guarantee control of the Supreme Court for an entire generation. And 7-2 decisions will hold up much more over time than 5-4 decisions which are viewed as lacking in mandate. Hillary has made it clear she will use the Supreme Court to go after the 2nd Amendment. She has literally said that the Supreme Court was wrong in its Heller decision stating that the Court should overturn and remove the individual right to keep and bear arms. Period. Anyone and Everyone who is saying that they won't vote for one candidate or the other if they are the GOP nominee, please realize this. Hear this! If Hillary Clinton wins and gets to make these appointments, you likely will never see another conservative victory at the Supreme Court level for the rest of your life.Ever.Whoever is the GOP  nominee, go VOTE for the GOP Nominee! Remember Romney?Three million conservatives who had voted for McCain did not cast a vote for Romney (for whatever reason and the result was four additional years of B.H.O.) AND ONE FINAL THOUGHT, Hillary''s already on the record as saying that her buddy, B.H.O. "would make a great Supreme Court Justice."  DID YOU JUST READ THAT LAST SENTENCE?  NOW ARE YOU SCARED?I am not crazy about either candidate, but I look at it this way, our freedoms, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to bear arms, which candidate will protect those freedoms or which one will put those freedoms in jeopardy?  Who is pro life? Who has been successful financially?  Who hasn't lied to the American people about Benghazi?  Who hasn't lied to the American people about 30,000 emails?  The list of questions goes on and on, and at the end of the day, it is like Rick and Bubba put it, vote for flawed or evil?  I simply cannot vote for evil. If I choose to stay home or write in someone, it is a vote for Hillary. Crazy messed up system, but that is what we get as an American voter. So for this gal I will take flawed Trump!From that standpoint, on the vote your conscience, I understand, totally. An American with a clear conscience simply cannot vote for Hillary, that is an oxymoron!Hilkary has the SAME AGENDA as Obama to destroy America. Hillary took $$$ from both domestic & foreign donors, Hillary OWES them...think about it!  Copy and paste and SHARE with everyone you know that America is in JEOPARDY!

If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, Rich Arabs World, Globalist Elites, George Soro, Rich Arabs countries, terrorist, radical Islamist, Lazy Muslims, planned parenthood, the media, Hollywood and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with...Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.
11 | Bob Adams | 0 | 10154054020410950_10154054031880950 | If Hillary is voted in then America will continue the total change to the Republic by allowing millions of illegal immigrants, to vote and take American jobs. She has said she will raise taxes on the middle class to give refugees and continue to redistribute the wealth. "A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world‚Äôs greatest civilizations has been 200 years." This quote is attributed to Alexander Fraser Tytler. In 1814, John Adams said "Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide."

So what would the trump supporters do then?also leave the US? Hehehe,after the election, America has a long way to heal,embrace peace and move on.
3 | Steve Zakszewski | 27 | 10154053989620950_10154054039185950 | Yeah, right-- this from a man with Mexican, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Bangladeshi sweat shops, just lost a Labor Relations Board case where he refused to recognize the results of an election held by hotel workers in his Vegas hotel, bought hundreds of millions of dollars of Chinese steel that was illegally price-dumped instead of American steel, and used undocumented workers on his projects and then refused to pay them.  Anyone dumb enough to believe his lies and vote for that lying hustler swine deserves the deep and relentless screwing he's gonna give them.

6 | James D. Scapin | 8 | 10154053989620950_10154054037310950 | Remember, A Republican Fired 80% of a Workforce. Republicans like to keep "labor", under control. If you think voting Republican will insure worker's rights, THINK again. Hayes, is another example of a Republican, that proved he disliked organized Labor.

14 | Catherine Day Sonenberg | 0 | 10154053989620950_10154054352800950 | Let the games begin!!This post is for the 'undecided' out there as well as to those that are saying, "I'm writing in", "I'm not voting" and "I'm picking someone other than the Top 2". This is a YUUUGE Election. We are forced to pick the 'lesser of two evils'. This is due to the fact that we didn't get to hear from the Libertarian and Green Party candidates in the Debates. We might actually have found compelling candidates to vote for, if the American people spoke up (if it wasn't for their low support %'s) If Trump ran as an Independent as I wish he had done, then maybe there could have been a Republican, 3rd option. Though I've said it many times and I still stand by it,  our next President has already been selected and for ALL the WRONG reasons. I'll leave it at that but I'm hoping that there was a chance that I'm wrong about our Political System. I'm voting for my life. I'm voting for my money. I'm voting for the benefit and the well-being for my Family. This is why YOU should do the same and vote for Donald J. Trump!!!!- "LOCK HER UP" Hillary Clinton DESERVES to go to jail and should NOT have been able to run for the Presidency for the simple fact of being caught LYING; aside from having SO many other questionable charges against her. When you have someone who has a track record of behaving with an "I'm above the law" mentality and then make her President, what message does it send to the rest of the country? How should we trust a woman (person) who doesn't even deserve to have a security clearance as President?- Another thing to know about Hillary Clinton---- she is corrupt to the core!!!! If she becomes President, the US government will be controlled by the corrupt, "Pay-to-Play", money laundering Clinton Foundation. She started this when Bill was in office and continued on as Secretary of State. Do you really think these people really wanted to hear Bill speak? Please.... They paid him by giving ENORMOUS sums of money and large gifts to the Foundation. That's UNETHICAL by every meaning of the word which further proves that the Clinton's were receiving outright BRIBES. But again, Hillary is untouchable!!- Since the death of Scalia, Obama has been unable to select his replacement. Thank You SJC. It will be considered after the election. This bodes well because 3 of the current judges are 'up there in age' and Ginsburg has once stated that she would retire. She has since taken it back. But what if, WHAT IF, I said, she's waiting for Hillary to WIN? Well, if she retires, that can be another 2 open seats for the Democrats to fill. If that happens, well.... Just imagine. SCARY!!!!- There were more than 600 emailed requests for HELP, military support and added Security for Benghazi. 4 Americans are dead because ALL those requests had been ignored. Hillary has also helped create the Iranian nuclear deal, in which we gave $1.7 Billion to an anti-American nation to get nuclear weapons. Despite the fact that we are a nation it's most likely to use them on, the fun fact that it will create a new nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Was this a "penalty/fine" for the Drone that crashed in Iran not too long ago??? After all, it's interesting that they too are a terrorist supporting nation.- Hillary wants to reward illegal immigrants by granting them American citizenship because she feels that our borders are secure. She is also promising an amnesty Bill within her first 100 days of office. How can you have a candidate that 'thumbs her nose' to the American people, for people who are literally running across the border expecting to enjoy the benefits of our system, is absolutely crazy!!! I guess we should just open the gates and open up our checkbooks. Maybe, we can take care of the people trying to sneak in that are purposely trying to harm us too. There's a strong likelihood that ISIS is already slipping agents into the Syrian refugees that Obama is taking in. And the fact that somewhere around 90% of them will end up on government assistance, Hillary wants to increase that number by 500%. My question is::: How much did she really sell the US of A for?????If you want to read up anymore on Hillary before placing your 'vote' and you want the truth, then Wikileaks explains her position best. Stay away from CNN, WaPo, Huffington..... basically ANY MEDIA!!! Again, I HOPE that I'm wrong then we can finally move forward and make America Great Again. GOD BLESS US ALL!!!#HILLARYMUSTNOTWIN#notogary#notojill#donaldtrumpforprez#makeamericagreatagain#orangeisthenewblack ;)
15 | Caze Oliveira | 1 | 10154053989620950_10154054011080950 | Seems like what he planned, needed, expected, is that after all the non sense, naive people would believe on his show of empty promises and give to him the White House and status he need after all the rest of his life collapsed. He will do nothing to anyone else simply because he doesn't know how or has any support doing so, but getting the "name" of president would be fun and good for his tv network. ... he did nothing wrong selling heaven... the ones that believed it are the ones that need to have their brains, heart, morals and values checked.

18 | Christopher CJ Stolte | 1 | 10154053989620950_10154054089260950 | As Election Day is upon us, I find myself more worried than I've ever been. I realize that no matter what happens today, this country is in trouble. The people spoke months ago, and it seems somehow we ventured into infinite ignorance of the electorate. We had choices, good choices, possibly solid choices, and instead, we picked two of the worst, by far, candidates to run this country. Maybe it's a sign of the times, of where, as a society, we truly have our heads at. We gave this country the choice between Celebrity vs Gender, rather than substance. I can't help but wonder how we'd look if we had chosen Cruz vs Sanders. In the wake of it all, so much divisiveness in this country. So much hatred, bigotry, and fear, and it may only get worse, no matter who wins today. Honestly, no matter what, the real loser is America, and we've got only ourselves to blame.

And the average American is sick to death of their lies, and corruption. All their shit about the middle class, and the poor is just that Bullshit. After 8 years of Obama, the rich like the Corrupt Clintons have gotten richer, while the average American tries to figure out how to pay their bills. The greedy Clintons with all their money, cheated those who contributed to the Clinton Foundation, using their money to pay for their spoiled daughters wedding, and 10 million dollars apartment. Hell Chelsea wouldn't even campagin for her money without a pay check from the Clinton Foundation. Oh but it does good work, my ass! Just imagine if the Trump Foundation had done that. Rag news outlets like this one would be all over him!

1 | Lauretta Rivers | 15 | 10154053956335950_10154053994055950 | So sick watching CBS this morning...wasting a lot time with their Hillary propaganda....so sick of the Bias from the MSM....You don't care about the working class either....damn elites.
2 | Teresa Cooper | 9 | 10154053956335950_10154053989705950 | Hillary Supporters, You think you are right about voting for Hillary Clinton, but the children in your family will suffer tremendously in a country with no borders and no guns to protects ourselves. I am assuming that when you go to bed at night that you don't lock your doors and that there is a sign in your yard saying "Come on in", coz that is exactly what Hillary represents for this country. No security while we go about our daily lives and inviting all terrorists, drug smugglers, and hardened criminals to come on in. Shame on you for not thinking about the future of your children a little harder before you made this crucial decision. If she wins, you will see the America you have created for them.
3 | Jack Rougeaux | 2 | 10154053956335950_10154054050310950 | Watching CBS ( Constance Bull Shit ) it's all about Hillary Clinton and how she going to win. So much for honestly in Broadcasting just more lies and propaganda.
4 | Klaus Reck | 1 | 10154053956335950_10154054200680950 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are ‚Äúmorons,‚Äù ‚Äúidiots,‚Äù ‚Äúimbeciles,‚Äù ‚Äúhuman weeds,‚Äù and ‚Äúmisfits.‚Äù Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump
5 | Ingrid Joyce | 2 | 10154053956335950_10154053974020950 | I place my faith in the many Americans who are wise, are knowledgeable and can discern good from evil....smart Americans who are not easily lead by a toxic, dysfunctional, lunatic , corrupt Trump...I believe in Those Americans who  are intuitive, analytical and are not gullible...and are distracted from the Trump evil rhetoric , those Americans who choose peace over hatred, good over evil, those Americans who will ensure that Trump does win...I believe in hope over fear.....Trust that America will be free of Trump and his evil, divisive tactics... Reading the Trump supporters hatred comments supports how Trump has been such a horrible candidate for America....wake up America get fired up Vote Hilary
6 | Sydney Nichols | 0 | 10154053956335950_10154054214400950 | America is at a crossroads, If you are considering writing in a name or voting 3rd party, America is in JEOPARDY! Todays electionSome people have brought up the fact that they won't vote if the eventual nominee is not the person they want. I just want to put something in perspective. Justice Scalia's seat is vacant. Ginsberg is 82 years old Kennedy is 79 Breyer is 77 Thomas is 67.Nowadays, the data shows that the average age of a Supreme Court retirement or death occurs after 75.These are 5 vacancies that will likely come up over the next 4-8 years.The next President will have the power to potentially create a 7-2 Supreme Court skewed in their ideology. Think about that  7-2.If the next President appoints 5 young justices, it will****guarantee control of the Supreme Court for an entire generation. And 7-2 decisions will hold up much more over time than 5-4 decisions which are viewed as lacking in mandate. Hillary has made it clear she will use the Supreme Court to go after the 2nd Amendment. She has literally said that the Supreme Court was wrong in its Heller decision stating that the Court should overturn and remove the individual right to keep and bear arms. Period. Anyone and Everyone who is saying that they won't vote for one candidate or the other if they are the GOP nominee, please realize this. Hear this! If Hillary Clinton wins and gets to make these appointments, you likely will never see another conservative victory at the Supreme Court level for the rest of your life.Ever.Whoever is the GOP  nominee, go VOTE for the GOP Nominee! Remember Romney?Three million conservatives who had voted for McCain did not cast a vote for Romney (for whatever reason and the result was four additional years of B.H.O.) AND ONE FINAL THOUGHT, Hillary''s already on the record as saying that her buddy, B.H.O. "would make a great Supreme Court Justice."  DID YOU JUST READ THAT LAST SENTENCE?  NOW ARE YOU SCARED?I am not crazy about either candidate, but I look at it this way, our freedoms, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to bear arms, which candidate will protect those freedoms or which one will put those freedoms in jeopardy?  Who is pro life? Who has been successful financially?  Who hasn't lied to the American people about Benghazi?  Who hasn't lied to the American people about 30,000 emails?  The list of questions goes on and on, and at the end of the day, it is like Rick and Bubba put it, vote for flawed or evil?  I simply cannot vote for evil. If I choose to stay home or write in someone, it is a vote for Hillary. Crazy messed up system, but that is what we get as an American voter. So for this gal I will take flawed Trump!From that standpoint, on the vote your conscience, I understand, totally. An American with a clear conscience simply cannot vote for Hillary, that is an oxymoron!Hilkary has the SAME AGENDA as Obama to destroy America. Hillary took $$$ from both domestic & foreign donors, Hillary OWES them...think about it!  Copy and paste and SHARE with everyone you know that America is in JEOPARDY!
7 | Bob Adams | 0 | 10154053956335950_10154054033570950 | If Hillary is voted in then America will continue the total change to the Republic by allowing millions of illegal immigrants, to vote and take American jobs. She has said she will raise taxes on the middle class to give refugees and continue to redistribute the wealth. "A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world‚Äôs greatest civilizations has been 200 years." This quote is attributed to Alexander Fraser Tytler. In 1814, John Adams said "Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide."

9 | Morgan Orlins | 4 | 10154053956335950_10154053974320950 | Something to watch for today: The under-polled, under-sampled Trump voters.I've been to two of Trump's local rallies here in NE FL, and as a veteran politico, I can say with certainty that a HUGE percentage of Trump's voters are irregular or even first-time voters. Nanette and I have talked to LOTS of them, and they tend NOT to be ideologically motivated.For many of these Trump voters that I've encountered, the difference is a simple matter of right and wrong, good and bad. They see Trump as their champion, and Hillary as the wicked witch; and they're at least half right!! :-)So watch for this: If Trump takes Mich., Wis., Minn., Penn, FL, or any combination thereof, THE ROUT IS ON!!
10 | Chepo Team | 4 | 10154053956335950_10154053957420950 | As American hispanics, we are tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the fantastic Trump Strong t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/trumpstrong .And let's Make America Great Again!

I hope the people of our great country feel the same and keep Hillary Clinton out of the White House. Lets be proud of our history 10-20-30-40...years up the road and not have any regrets.

1 | William Friello DiStefano | 38 | 10154053881125950_10154053918855950 | Why no report on Scott Foval going off last night on Twitter admitting the DNC paid agitators to cause violence at Trump and BLM events? Do you not do journalism anymore?
2 | Norman G. Palmer II | 68 | 10154053881125950_10154053943570950 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.
3 | Gina Montgomery | 49 | 10154053881125950_10154053891415950 | ‚Ä¢ Trump will bring industry/manufacturing back to America & put Americans back to work.‚Ä¢ Trump will reign in China's currency manipulation & force them to play FAIR.‚Ä¢ Trump will stop foreign nations from ripping off #WeThePeople‚Äôs U.S. Treasury.‚Ä¢ Trump will use revenue surpluses to fix/renew our own crumbling infrastructure. ie: Bridges, roads, airports, etc.‚Ä¢ Trump will end foreign influence over OUR government.‚Ä¢ Trump will ensure that nations that benefit from defense functions we provide, pay their fair share.‚Ä¢ Trump, I believe, will be the greatest jobs president America has ever had.‚Ä¢ Trump will stop dangerous Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTO‚Äôs) from killing Americans with their violence and the poison they bring to America.‚Ä¢ Trump will end the deadly cycle of crime, violence and poverty in our inner cities.‚Ä¢ Trump is an outsider and beholden to no one, but his supporters, #WeThePeople.‚Ä¢ Trump is not a ‚Äòpolitician‚Äô in the conventional meaning. He tells the truth.‚Ä¢ Trump is a threat to those in power who want to keep the status quo of the system they helped to break.‚Ä¢ Trump is an Abolitionist Republican who is restoring the proud heritage of the GOP, the party of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and hundreds of other notable people.‚Ä¢ Trump is a fighter and a bold leader.‚Ä¢ Trump is a patriot who loves this country.‚Ä¢ Trump is an American in his heart and soul who will make #AmericaFirst his priority in all decisions.‚Ä¢ Trump will protect #WeThePeople by restoring Justice for All.‚Ä¢ Trump will bring back American leadership and global stability to a dangerous world by restoring ‚ÄòPeace Through Strength.‚Äô‚Ä¢ Trump will not get the U.S. involved in war unless there is a clear and present danger to America.‚Ä¢ Trump will keep the UN busybodies out of OUR business.‚Ä¢ Donald Trump is 90+% what #WeThePeople have wanted in a president‚Äôs policies for DECADES.‚Ä¢ Leftists say ‚Äúthe system is broken.‚Äù No it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs being misused and abused. Trump will make it work again for ALL Americans.‚Ä¢ Donald Trump will, in fact, #MakeAmericaGreatAgain.

7 | Catherine Day Sonenberg | 0 | 10154053881125950_10154054353925950 | Let the games begin!!This post is for the 'undecided' out there as well as to those that are saying, "I'm writing in", "I'm not voting" and "I'm picking someone other than the Top 2". This is a YUUUGE Election. We are forced to pick the 'lesser of two evils'. This is due to the fact that we didn't get to hear from the Libertarian and Green Party candidates in the Debates. We might actually have found compelling candidates to vote for, if the American people spoke up (if it wasn't for their low support %'s) If Trump ran as an Independent as I wish he had done, then maybe there could have been a Republican, 3rd option. Though I've said it many times and I still stand by it,  our next President has already been selected and for ALL the WRONG reasons. I'll leave it at that but I'm hoping that there was a chance that I'm wrong about our Political System. I'm voting for my life. I'm voting for my money. I'm voting for the benefit and the well-being for my Family. This is why YOU should do the same and vote for Donald J. Trump!!!!- "LOCK HER UP" Hillary Clinton DESERVES to go to jail and should NOT have been able to run for the Presidency for the simple fact of being caught LYING; aside from having SO many other questionable charges against her. When you have someone who has a track record of behaving with an "I'm above the law" mentality and then make her President, what message does it send to the rest of the country? How should we trust a woman (person) who doesn't even deserve to have a security clearance as President?- Another thing to know about Hillary Clinton---- she is corrupt to the core!!!! If she becomes President, the US government will be controlled by the corrupt, "Pay-to-Play", money laundering Clinton Foundation. She started this when Bill was in office and continued on as Secretary of State. Do you really think these people really wanted to hear Bill speak? Please.... They paid him by giving ENORMOUS sums of money and large gifts to the Foundation. That's UNETHICAL by every meaning of the word which further proves that the Clinton's were receiving outright BRIBES. But again, Hillary is untouchable!!- Since the death of Scalia, Obama has been unable to select his replacement. Thank You SJC. It will be considered after the election. This bodes well because 3 of the current judges are 'up there in age' and Ginsburg has once stated that she would retire. She has since taken it back. But what if, WHAT IF, I said, she's waiting for Hillary to WIN? Well, if she retires, that can be another 2 open seats for the Democrats to fill. If that happens, well.... Just imagine. SCARY!!!!- There were more than 600 emailed requests for HELP, military support and added Security for Benghazi. 4 Americans are dead because ALL those requests had been ignored. Hillary has also helped create the Iranian nuclear deal, in which we gave $1.7 Billion to an anti-American nation to get nuclear weapons. Despite the fact that we are a nation it's most likely to use them on, the fun fact that it will create a new nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Was this a "penalty/fine" for the Drone that crashed in Iran not too long ago??? After all, it's interesting that they too are a terrorist supporting nation.- Hillary wants to reward illegal immigrants by granting them American citizenship because she feels that our borders are secure. She is also promising an amnesty Bill within her first 100 days of office. How can you have a candidate that 'thumbs her nose' to the American people, for people who are literally running across the border expecting to enjoy the benefits of our system, is absolutely crazy!!! I guess we should just open the gates and open up our checkbooks. Maybe, we can take care of the people trying to sneak in that are purposely trying to harm us too. There's a strong likelihood that ISIS is already slipping agents into the Syrian refugees that Obama is taking in. And the fact that somewhere around 90% of them will end up on government assistance, Hillary wants to increase that number by 500%. My question is::: How much did she really sell the US of A for?????If you want to read up anymore on Hillary before placing your 'vote' and you want the truth, then Wikileaks explains her position best. Stay away from CNN, WaPo, Huffington..... basically ANY MEDIA!!! Again, I HOPE that I'm wrong then we can finally move forward and make America Great Again. GOD BLESS US ALL!!!#HILLARYMUSTNOTWIN#notogary#notojill#donaldtrumpforprez#makeamericagreatagain#orangeisthenewblack ;)

The system will ultimately collapse and we'll be forced into a single payer system. Socialized Medicine. The goal all along.Lawlessness will reign. The Clinton's will rule the Department of Justice with a compliant Loretta Lynch at the helm. Laws will only apply to the little people while the elites will run wild with no consequence.After much "debate", the Second Amendment will be repealed. An unarmed citizenry is a compliant citizenry. We will become "subjects" instead of citizenry.The economy will continue to crumble. Our pathetic GDP will become "the good old days", as more and more jobs are lost and sent overseas with the TPP.No more borders. We will be flooded by socieltal burdens. Some just lazy; some good, hard working families; some very, very, very bad. It won't take long before we start seeing the results.Say so long to Freedom of Speech. Expect the return of The Fairness Doctrine to silence contrary thought. The UN will be given control of the internet and all "unapproved content" will be banned.The media will become emboldened to lie even more blatantly. They will direct the message for their masters in the White House.The Supreme Court wil be filled with Activist Judges. Our freedoms will gradually disappear. Not all at once. Bit by bit. So we hardly ever notice.She will finish what Obama started. Namely, the destruction of our beloved Republic. I know some don't believe this. But the writing is on the wall. You will see. And like Obama, regrets are an expensive thing.

I am assuming that when you go to bed at night that you don't lock your doors and that there is a sign in your yard saying "Come on in", coz that is exactly what Hillary represents for this country. No security while we go about our daily lives and inviting all terrorists, drug smugglers, and hardened criminals to come on in. Shame on you for not thinking about the future of your children a little harder before you made this crucial decision. If she wins, you will see the America you have created for them.

And the average American is sick to death of their lies, and corruption. All their shit about the middle class, and the poor is just that Bullshit. After 8 years of Obama, the rich like the Corrupt Clintons have gotten richer, while the average American tries to figure out how to pay their bills. The greedy Clintons with all their money, cheated those who contributed to the Clinton Foundation, using their money to pay for their spoiled daughters wedding, and 10 million dollars apartment. Hell Chelsea wouldn't even campagin for her money without a pay check from the Clinton Foundation. Oh but it does good work, my ass!  Just imagine if the Trump Foundation had done that.

She wants to flood America with people who are NOT coming here to live the American Dream... They want to bring Sharia Law to America...

22 | Steve Siemen | 2 | 10154053881125950_10154053990100950 | A Clinton PresidencyShe will grant illegal aliens citizenship allowing them to vote.She won‚Äôt close the border because she wants open borders, she will essentially erase our border. We know that from one of her Wikileaks emails and what her husband has said.More foreigners will come into our country and she will again make them citizens.I live in California and reading the voter pamphlet I know most of this to be true.As our California governor did, Hillary will welcome all new aliens. They will vote only for those people with the same cultural surname. She will designate the illiterate new immigrants as disadvantaged. There will be a map drawn up showing where the disadvantaged communities are.SB 535 Disadvantaged Communities (Map)http://oehha.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Viewer/index.html?appid=dae2fb1e42674c12a04a2b302a080598Justice Map, Demographics. This was the federal Department of Transportation. They like trains.http://www.justicemap.org/index.php?gsLayer=white&gfLon=-95.3&gfLat=39.6&giZoom=4She believes in manmade global warming where Carbon Dioxide is bad. Unfortunately for Americans it is essential for life. It comes from methane, cow farts and all internal combustion engines such as your car and power plants.She will allow the EPA to eliminate those polluters which include many businesses that use too much power. Businesses that need too much power can move to countries with no pollution control. In California we call it AB 32.To create jobs for the new illiterates she will have a jobs corps and jobs training to build solar and wind power plants subsidized by the rest of us.To alleviate the gas from cows, the environmentalists are looking at seaweed. So much for grazing land and the price of meat. Cows hurt the environment, the land and air.Cars are bad, the United Nations tells us so. United Nations ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù boss Zeid Ra‚Äôad al-Hussein appears to be cracking up as he violently and erratically lashes out at free markets, Western voters, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, gun rights, the nation-state, British Brexit leader Nigel Farage, Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders, Czech President Milos Zeman, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, and other targets of what appears to be his deep-seated hatred. He also blasted Western voters concerned about open borders and security for their alleged ‚Äúnatural prejudice.‚ÄùTo eliminate cars, first they will make gas illegal or too expensive. They will designate street lanes as bus only lanes or bicycle only lanes. They will greatly reduce parking spaces. They will build impenetrable surface level blockades of light rail lines and bus lines forcing people into high-density apartments.People will move from the suburbs to Hillary‚Äôs apartments because transportation will consist only of public transportation. To get from home to a job you will take public transportation and there will be no parking at the transportation hubs.In 2016 in California we are again voting on teaching children in Spanish.Illiterate parents with their anchor babies will get subsidized housing in those high-density apartments. The other apartments will have their rents raised to pay for the poor. The people that still cling to their guns and religion and suburban housing will have federal requirements to report to HUD, income inequality. It‚Äôs already the law. Local zoning laws will be superseded by federal law and they will build high-density housing next door to you. No more moving up in society.With high-density housing comes the necessity of providing public transportation. Get the picture yet?

Why would the same countries that sponsor TERRORISM sponsor HRC, do you think it may have something to do with her stance on letting 3/4 million refugees from Syria which we can not vet properly, their whole goal is to get people in positions where they can commit Jihad, that's what they invest in they want to hasten the coming of their messiah, if you care about your country and its not racist to put America first, it's just common sense.

14 | Gwenn Bragan Walden | 0 | 10154053856480950_10154054044775950 | Hillary, as Secretary of State, would sell terrorist nations large weapons deals only after they gave her a very generous donation to her ‚Äúfoundation.‚Äù These weapons, provided by Hillary and her State Department, then filtered down from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya, and so on to create, supply, and bolster terrorist groups.That is exactly how ISIS was created. But instead of blowing them up with an air assault, Hillary and Obama decided to leave ISIS alone. Why? Because ISIS being in the Middle East allows the Obama/Clinton machine to make millions in personal profits from these nations in a repetitive cycle of selling weapons.They are choosing personal gain over eliminating a terrorist group. Let that sink in. Why else have they not arrested Hillary for all of these crimes? The FBI would arrest you in a heartbeat if you went to Facebook right now to praise Allah and ISIS.It also speaks volumes as to why they are trying so hard to silence Julian Assange.The media remains silent on all of this. This would be plastered all over the news for months if a President Trump was exposed for this.Ignorant politicians are not the problem. The problem is that ignorant people keep voting for them every election. This is the exact reason we desperately need change in this country, and it starts with Donald Trump.People like Julian Assange have given up their lives to expose corruption in government and allowing Hillary Clinton to win this election makes all of his sacrifices meaningless.He has offered us a chance to revolt against our tyrannical government. Chances likes this do not occur often, and if we do not seize the opportunity, we will suffer another four years of suppression from our corrupt leaders.Vote Trump, so that we can save America and he can pardon Julian Assange.
15 | Bryan Dale | 0 | 10154053856480950_10154054515710950 | It's just amazing to me as I've read numerous comments over the past year or so about today's presidential election, how so many people are cavalierly treating this like a sporting event. Like they're only rooting for their favorite team or athlete, instead of voting on many very important issues that will change millions of people's lives. Remember folks, it's not about individuals and their personalities you may like or dislike. This presidential election is about the course this country will take for the next 4 years. It's serious business if we do not turn this country back to the God given values that made her special to begin with.Forget for a moment if you will about this charismatic leader or that person that's rough around the edges. What's important is not how polished their speeches are or how many times they misspoke. We need to be focused on the issues they're acually supporting or opposing, for we've been counseled to vote on issues, not personalities. We should be doing our part to elect Godly servants that will uphold and promote His priorities, not our own, for those are the everlasting values this great nation was founded upon. "Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers, and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and interest of our Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers." ‚ÄìJohn Jay
16 | Lena Persson | 0 | 10154053856480950_10154054399490950 | I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump.

He tells the truth.‚Ä¢ Trump is a threat to those in power who want to keep the status quo of the system they helped to break.‚Ä¢ Trump is an Abolitionist Republican who is restoring the proud heritage of the GOP, the party of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Rev.

3 | Robert J Bachlet | 13 | 10154053814460950_10154053855660950 | Please go out and vote today! Early voting from New Hampshire  that started at 12 midnight in one town. Eight votes! 4 for Hillary, 2 for Trump, 1 third-party, and 1 write in for Mitt Romney. You personally may not want Trump or Hillary but if you vote third-party or vote for your write in candidate you are voting for Hillary Clinton! Think about that for a second!I don't ask people to share much but I think we need to share the heck out of this!
4 | Jodie Featherston Moss | 15 | 10154053814460950_10154053947995950 | I don't like either candidate. However, presentation is important. The president is a representative, if you will, of our country. People from all over the world, our allies & enemies, judge us in large part, by the demeanor of our leader as he/she speaks. Trump has no filter. He cannot handle criticism. He cannot handle opposing views. He cannot handle a tough situation. He throws a fit like a belligerent, childish man, even during speeches. He makes the most obscure, immature, irresponsible remarks. All for the world to see. Hillary, is able to maintain her composure, at least act professional & has a filter when on camera. These qualities are very important when the world is watching.I had originally planned to vote third party. Now I've decided this election, isn't the election to do that. I'll be giving Hillary my vote to help keep sociopathic Trump, out.

7 | Klaus Reck | 3 | 10154053814460950_10154054201340950 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are ‚Äúmorons,‚Äù ‚Äúidiots,‚Äù ‚Äúimbeciles,‚Äù ‚Äúhuman weeds,‚Äù and ‚Äúmisfits.‚Äù Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump

11 | Morgan Orlins | 12 | 10154053814460950_10154053815320950 | Something to watch for today: The under-polled, under-sampled Trump voters.I've been to two of Trump's local rallies here in NE FL, and as a veteran politico, I can say with certainty that a HUGE percentage of Trump's voters are irregular or even first-time voters. I have talked to LOTS of them, and they tend NOT to be ideologically motivated.For many of these Trump voters that I've encountered, the difference is a simple matter of right and wrong, good and bad. They see Trump as their champion, and Hillary as the wicked witch; and they're at least half right!! :-)So watch for this: If Trump takes Wis., Minn., Penn, FL, or any combination thereof, THE ROUT IS ON!!
12 | Tomas Davis | 17 | 10154053814460950_10154053818095950 | New polls are indicating the beginning of a Trump sweep across the USA. Clinton voters are no where to be found and appear to be merely media hype that is collapsing like an empty shell.

15 | Henrik Ahlm | 11 | 10154053814460950_10154053829660950 | Trump lacks stature, brains and good manners! He is not true to his words - all babble - no action!Trump is a nutbag and in no way fit for being the President and Commander in Chief of the highest public office on this planet! A low-life creature, who started his presidential campaign calling his opponent "crooked". Republicans, who are responsible for letting a retarded nutbag and low-life creature represent them now owes it to the American people to act in an intelligent way in Congress. Trump is a criminal, a facist and looks like a pig and he'll be dealt with that way! Clinton is "much more a man" than Trump. Trump is a chicken! Period! Trump - because he is stupid and ignorant - thinks 640.000 e-mails cannot be checked in 8 days.Technology today exists which in less than millisecond can check 640.000 e-mails (an advanced stage of quantum mechanics) Vote Hillary, November 8, 2016 and sanity will still prevail.Ps. Sanity will prevail! Hillary is the winner! I know (+323 electoral votes). Final result at 09.00 p. m. God bless.

19 | Destiny Masterson | 1 | 10154053814460950_10154053857665950 | Twenty four years ago billionaire businessman Ross Perot warned Americans about the dismantling of our manufacturing infrastructure, due to one-sided trade deals. Since that time, we have we gutted our steel, manufacturing, technology and textiles leaving mostly service sector jobs for the pickings... The fact is, our Country has the land mass, population and the infrastructure to rebuild and reignite virtually every sector that has been decimated. The elites say it can't be done, however, history tells a different story.After WWII's bombing of Japan, the United States re-built Japan...... We aren't rebuilding a war torn nation....

3 | Christian Taino | 0 | 10154053789995950_10154054011670950 | Trump is the WORST thing to ever happen to America. He has made people HATE again. He has divided a nation that will take forever to heal and he has done it through his racism, hate, and bigotry. He is a con a crook and sexual pervert that belongs behind bars.
4 | Stephen Goulbourne | 0 | 10154053789995950_10154054677000950 | Watching the news from the line-ups in Pennsylvania, a man wearing a Trump shirt told about how fracking poisoned his towns water supply, "which he blamed on Hillary," and Don Trump told his community he'll clean up the problem and fix their town!? What will happen when he can't do one thing he's promised? Will all Trump supporters blame Trump, T.V, Obama?
5 | Catherine Day Sonenberg | 0 | 10154053789995950_10154054479220950 | Let the games begin!!This post is for the 'undecided' out there as well as to those that are saying, "I'm writing in", "I'm not voting" and "I'm picking someone other than the Top 2". This is a YUUUGE Election. We are forced to pick the 'lesser of two evils'. This is due to the fact that we didn't get to hear from the Libertarian and Green Party candidates in the Debates. We might actually have found compelling candidates to vote for, if the American people spoke up (if it wasn't for their low support %'s) If Trump ran as an Independent as I wish he had done, then maybe there could have been a Republican, 3rd option. Though I've said it many times and I still stand by it,  our next President has already been selected and for ALL the WRONG reasons. I'll leave it at that but I'm hoping that there was a chance that I'm wrong about our Political System. I'm voting for my life. I'm voting for my money. I'm voting for the benefit and the well-being for my Family. This is why YOU should do the same and vote for Donald J. Trump!!!!- "LOCK HER UP" Hillary Clinton DESERVES to go to jail and should NOT have been able to run for the Presidency for the simple fact of being caught LYING; aside from having SO many other questionable charges against her. When you have someone who has a track record of behaving with an "I'm above the law" mentality and then make her President, what message does it send to the rest of the country? How should we trust a woman (person) who doesn't even deserve to have a security clearance as President?- Another thing to know about Hillary Clinton---- she is corrupt to the core!!!! If she becomes President, the US government will be controlled by the corrupt, "Pay-to-Play", money laundering Clinton Foundation. She started this when Bill was in office and continued on as Secretary of State. Do you really think these people really wanted to hear Bill speak? Please.... They paid him by giving ENORMOUS sums of money and large gifts to the Foundation. That's UNETHICAL by every meaning of the word which further proves that the Clinton's were receiving outright BRIBES. But again, Hillary is untouchable!!- Since the death of Scalia, Obama has been unable to select his replacement. Thank You SJC. It will be considered after the election. This bodes well because 3 of the current judges are 'up there in age' and Ginsburg has once stated that she would retire. She has since taken it back. But what if, WHAT IF, I said, she's waiting for Hillary to WIN? Well, if she retires, that can be another 2 open seats for the Democrats to fill. If that happens, well.... Just imagine. SCARY!!!!- There were more than 600 emailed requests for HELP, military support and added Security for Benghazi. 4 Americans are dead because ALL those requests had been ignored. Hillary has also helped create the Iranian nuclear deal, in which we gave $1.7 Billion to an anti-American nation to get nuclear weapons. Despite the fact that we are a nation it's most likely to use them on, the fun fact that it will create a new nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Was this a "penalty/fine" for the Drone that crashed in Iran not too long ago??? After all, it's interesting that they too are a terrorist supporting nation.- Hillary wants to reward illegal immigrants by granting them American citizenship because she feels that our borders are secure. She is also promising an amnesty Bill within her first 100 days of office. How can you have a candidate that 'thumbs her nose' to the American people, for people who are literally running across the border expecting to enjoy the benefits of our system, is absolutely crazy!!! I guess we should just open the gates and open up our checkbooks. Maybe, we can take care of the people trying to sneak in that are purposely trying to harm us too. There's a strong likelihood that ISIS is already slipping agents into the Syrian refugees that Obama is taking in. And the fact that somewhere around 90% of them will end up on government assistance, Hillary wants to increase that number by 500%. My question is::: How much did she really sell the US of A for?????If you want to read up anymore on Hillary before placing your 'vote' and you want the truth, then Wikileaks explains her position best. Stay away from CNN, WaPo, Huffington..... basically ANY MEDIA!!! Again, I HOPE that I'm wrong then we can finally move forward and make America Great Again. GOD BLESS US ALL!!!#HILLARYMUSTNOTWIN#notogary#notojill#donaldtrumpforprez#makeamericagreatagain#orangeisthenewblack ;)

7 | Laura Coleman | 0 | 10154053789995950_10154054669425950 | Democrats claim they are insulted by Trumps words? But not insulted by the words and actions of the Clintons? Not insulted by the words in the songs that Jay Z and Beyonce sang at her rally? Not insulted with all the lies and corruption for years by the Clintons. Trump has insulting words, Hillary has insulting actions, like what difference does it make. Or her campaign talking about how she hates the average American. Or how they trashed the Catholics, who they consider our faith in the dark ages, or that we need a Democratic Spring! Or the millions of people she called deplorables. And who in the hell does she think she is to say we are irredeemable. Only Jesus can decide that! Spare us your bullshit of hurt feeling, when Obama and Clinton have been lecturing and insulting the American people for 8 years! Sick to death of the Washington elitist telling us what kind of country we are! They are clueless!
8 | Quek GL | 2 | 10154053789995950_10154054027300950 | ****Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, Rich Arabs World, Globalist Elites, George Soro, Rich Arabs countries, terrorist, radical Islamist, Lazy Muslims, planned parenthood, the media, Hollywood and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with...Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.

The die was now cast.America's present would not be like Germany's past.And the only wall the Trump would be currently buildingWas the one around his bank accounts - that were rapidly wiltingHillary went to the Oval Office to continue her work.Drumpf got his Twitter back and remained a big jerk.America took a deep breath and enjoyed the fall.Get a good day's history and happy Election Day to all!#Election2016

The third-party candidate has a shot at winning his home state of Utah, which could be a problem for Donald Trump.

2 | Scott Rose | 16 | 10154053762670950_10154053781115950 | Funny how CBS is talking about this guy when the only 3rd party candidate with any kind of chance is Johnson. He is the only one on the ballot in all 50 states.
3 | Lisa Franklin | 5 | 10154053762670950_10154053775145950 | Grwat. Now we'll never hear the end of how the Mormons rigged Utah. That will be two religions he hates.
4 | Jamie Borkowski | 6 | 10154053762670950_10154053773575950 | For all those leaning towards a Evan McMullin protest vote in Utah. Please answer a few questions before voting.Who is Nathan Johnson? Do you know? Because I do. He is a black Mormon man who spoke at the RNC, look it up. It seems he must have got cold feet. But guess what, Finn per our Constitution can never ever be VP, no one legally gets to "step aside" so it is crazy for Evan to say otherwise. Do you know Evan is more of an insider in DC than Trump? How or Why would I say this? Because he worked for the GOP in DC. Infact, where is his campaign headquartered? Utah? Nope. Well his www.evanMcMullin.orgURL is registered to a little office in DC in his fathers name and across from the CIA and Capitol police buildings. Do you know his staff? They are from BFA. What is that? It is a McCain, Romney and Bush family supported group. He is lock step with these men who are as establishment as the day is long. Do you know Evan was a gunrunner for Syrian rebels tied to ISIS? Go google the pics of him with John McCain when they secretly went into Syria and met with real terrorists. This is a known fact, that same trip McCain had a nice photo Op with a terrorist who ATE a Syrians soldiers heart- this is a fact too. Have you seen Evans Tedx talk? He openly admits to supporting regime change in Syria. He openly supports arming and escalating Wars in the Middle East. He worked at Goldman-Sachs the big bank that paid Hillary millions in speaker fees. What did he do there? It is private, he won't disclose anything about his work there. Do you know who Rick "F-bomb" Wilson is? This guy is a democrats dream for political strategy. He was welcomed on to Evans team not to long ago. Go look up "Rick Wilson political hack" and see about Evans moral compass and who he associates with. Look, I understand the desire for a protest vote, I get it. Maybe st in America support Trump,because he is the ultimate protest vote. But it is scary how little we know about this guy Evan McMullin, who worked to create chaos in the Middle East and is now trying the same tactics in Utah. UNITY in the GOP is the best way to beat the evil Hillary corruption and carnage machine. And the vetting process should be dealt with in primaries, it has always been so. One last point, the Founders set up this Republic to favor UNITY and Compromise over what is right or wrong. The opposite of UNITY and Compromise is pride and enmity. In the GOP anyone who says #never anyone is not willing to compromise after losing a primary and therefore pride destroys any chance for the party and the DNC receives the Presidency. Reagan taught us that he would always Compromise for 75% of what he wanted them fight for the rest later. He said the radical conservatives told him to "take nothing". Google the quotes of Reagan about Compromise. We need our good judges, we need a leader who will protect US industry, we need a healthy strong border, we need to be forgiving when someone apologizes and Trump has. We need to unify to best get most of our goals. The founders set it up so the 10% in the country who were right, would always lose if they did not Compromise and unify with others better than their foes. Evan is here to help Hillary because the establishment GOP and their lobbyists who sent him benefits from the system they created. Trump will gut their budgets like a fish, stop the corruption in DC and protect our country from these corporate hacks who, teal our treasure in war and cleaning sd our factories for gain in other lands. Evan knows he can not win but he can report back to his handlers that he caused the chaos requested. Choose wisely.
5 | Bob Burris | 2 | 10154053762670950_10154054238805950 | The first people Hillary will come after is Christians. She already said Catholics don't need to vote for her. Mormons will be slaughtered.

7 | Klaus Reck | 1 | 10154053762670950_10154054201830950 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are ‚Äúmorons,‚Äù ‚Äúidiots,‚Äù ‚Äúimbeciles,‚Äù ‚Äúhuman weeds,‚Äù and ‚Äúmisfits.‚Äù Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump

4 | Greg Amerson | 8 | 10154053743325950_10154053755040950 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

Donald Trump has stirred controversy for his comments about women and his treatment of them -- here's a look at his history with women.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dave Burgin | 122 | 10154053710020950_10154053735160950 | Yeah you guys posted a pic of the clintons like 'adorable' and all those years bill was raping and sexually assaulting women right n left..you guys along with many others have lost all your credibility...
2 | Courtnee Mulroy | 129 | 10154053710020950_10154053722300950 | Yet you just posted an article telling us to swoon over the Clintons when Bill cheated on his wife and is a womanizer. This woman is not that dumb, sorry.
3 | Allyson Burden | 24 | 10154053710020950_10154053953165950 | I've literally seen 6 negative Trump posts from you consecutively on my newsfeed this morning. Clearly CBS condones murder, lies, corruption and everything else that Hillary Clinton is! Goodbye CBS!!!!
4 | Sean O'Laughlin | 47 | 10154053710020950_10154053712605950 | This election has shown how little class the major news networks have. One last jab
5 | Patty Barnett Attaway | 21 | 10154053710020950_10154053773820950 | DO YOU PEOPLE EVER GIVE UP....When this is over, I expect your ratings to TANK and will do everything I can to encourage people to turn YOUR NEWS OFF and go find REAL NEWS.
6 | Sonia Love | 7 | 10154053710020950_10154053726970950 | The only reason why most people hate hillary is because she's a woman. Most of u have been brain washed to even see her as the devil.but looking at the two options, she's the better option. After all,the devil u know is better than the angel u don't know. #message to the America people. She's is your next president. Get used to it
7 | Leon Lopez | 8 | 10154053710020950_10154053731935950 | I've been trying so hard to understand why anyone would support this obviously racist, bigoted, low life of a man called "Donald Trump" then it came to me. These people are scared. They are not scared of Immigrants or Obama, They are not even afraid of Isis..They are afraid of losing "it". This former majority have now become the minority and they are scared. They don't want to evolve with the times so they go on the offensive. They start buying more guns, deny climate change, burn down Black churches and Planned Parenthood offices, Increase the hate crimes and domestic terrorist attacks.And for what? "Fear". They are trying to hold on to the past and they see this as their "Last Stand" and Trump is their "General Custer" or "Great white hope". Well, those of us who read know what happened to Custer. Hopefully this will be the last stand for open racism, bigotry and hate crimes. With any luck, if we join together against racism and hate and with the help of progressive, forward thinking people (from all political parties), we will force the racist and/or bigots to crawl back into the holes where they came from. And who knows? Maybe, just maybe, some may even crawl out of their holes to see the light...
8 | Tom Beatty | 9 | 10154053710020950_10154054045725950 | No bias, here, right CBS? Just showed a picture painting Bill and Hillary as the new Ozzie and Harriet or Ward and June Cleaver. Sad that a news organization which once employed Edward R. Murrow, Walter Cronkite, and Douglas Edwards has fallen to an all-time low!!!
9 | Trish Clevenger | 8 | 10154053710020950_10154053862115950 | If your going to do a year in review...shouldn't it be about how clinton was grossly negligent with classified information..review the thousand of leaks that show proof of her corruption..proof of media bias..oh wait you are proving that with every post.
10 | Todd Watkins | 9 | 10154053710020950_10154053854220950 | Yet you never reported on Hillary going to orgy island on the Lolita express with Jeffery Epstein ? Nor did you report the fact that John Podesta in his e-mails admits to attending satanic rituals? Sounds crazy ? It truly is and is true look it up
11 | Brian Myers | 4 | 10154053710020950_10154053963265950 | it's time for all Americans. white, black, Muslims, woman, all demographics to come together and send a message... not only to Donald Trump! but also to the right wing conservatives in Congress for all the obstruction over the last 8 years!!
12 | Christal Elerick-Miller | 0 | 10154053710020950_10154054318710950 | Let's look at Hillary's treatment of women:  she calls rape victims bimbos. She pays women less then men in her foundation and on her campaign, she tells women stand by your man: no matter how many women he assaults, she has shown that it's easier to attack the other person then to be honest about your own failings. She has shown it's ok to lie to the federal government because you get away with it. Oh and she has shown girls that you can take money from anyone even if it puts your family (the us) in danger.  Donald has issues but quit painting Hillary as a saint
13 | Tasha Duncan | 3 | 10154053710020950_10154054108780950 | Where's a negative look at Hillary.  A bias opinion has no relevance what so ever! If you conspired against them both,  we the people would have a better chance at voting fairly!
14 | Matthew Christensen | 2 | 10154053710020950_10154054090705950 | Hey election day is here, are you going to run even ONE positive piece about Trump? Oh that's right you're bought and paid for by the Clinton cartel.
15 | Catherine Day Sonenberg | 1 | 10154053710020950_10154054223985950 | Let the games begin!!This post is for the 'undecided' out there as well as to those that are saying, "I'm writing in", "I'm not voting" and "I'm picking someone other than the Top 2". This is a YUUUGE Election. We are forced to pick the 'lesser of two evils'. This is due to the fact that we didn't get to hear from the Libertarian and Green Party candidates in the Debates. We might actually have found compelling candidates to vote for, if the American people spoke up (if it wasn't for their low support %'s) If Trump ran as an Independent as I wish he had done, then maybe there could have been a Republican, 3rd option. Though I've said it many times and I still stand by it,  our next President has already been selected and for ALL the WRONG reasons. I'll leave it at that but I'm hoping that there was a chance that I'm wrong about our Political System. I'm voting for my life. I'm voting for my money. I'm voting for the benefit and the well-being for my Family. This is why YOU should do the same and vote for Donald J. Trump!!!!- "LOCK HER UP" Hillary Clinton DESERVES to go to jail and should NOT have been able to run for the Presidency for the simple fact of being caught LYING; aside from having SO many other questionable charges against her. When you have someone who has a track record of behaving with an "I'm above the law" mentality and then make her President, what message does it send to the rest of the country? How should we trust a woman (person) who doesn't even deserve to have a security clearance as President?- Another thing to know about Hillary Clinton---- she is corrupt to the core!!!! If she becomes President, the US government will be controlled by the corrupt, "Pay-to-Play", money laundering Clinton Foundation. She started this when Bill was in office and continued on as Secretary of State. Do you really think these people really wanted to hear Bill speak? Please.... They paid him by giving ENORMOUS sums of money and large gifts to the Foundation. That's UNETHICAL by every meaning of the word which further proves that the Clinton's were receiving outright BRIBES. But again, Hillary is untouchable!!- Since the death of Scalia, Obama has been unable to select his replacement. Thank You SJC. It will be considered after the election. This bodes well because 3 of the current judges are 'up there in age' and Ginsburg has once stated that she would retire. She has since taken it back. But what if, WHAT IF, I said, she's waiting for Hillary to WIN? Well, if she retires, that can be another 2 open seats for the Democrats to fill. If that happens, well.... Just imagine. SCARY!!!!- There were more than 600 emailed requests for HELP, military support and added Security for Benghazi. 4 Americans are dead because ALL those requests had been ignored. Hillary has also helped create the Iranian nuclear deal, in which we gave $1.7 Billion to an anti-American nation to get nuclear weapons. Despite the fact that we are a nation it's most likely to use them on, the fun fact that it will create a new nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Was this a "penalty/fine" for the Drone that crashed in Iran not too long ago??? After all, it's interesting that they too are a terrorist supporting nation.- Hillary wants to reward illegal immigrants by granting them American citizenship because she feels that our borders are secure. She is also promising an amnesty Bill within her first 100 days of office. How can you have a candidate that 'thumbs her nose' to the American people, for people who are literally running across the border expecting to enjoy the benefits of our system, is absolutely crazy!!! I guess we should just open the gates and open up our checkbooks. Maybe, we can take care of the people trying to sneak in that are purposely trying to harm us too. There's a strong likelihood that ISIS is already slipping agents into the Syrian refugees that Obama is taking in. And the fact that somewhere around 90% of them will end up on government assistance, Hillary wants to increase that number by 500%. My question is::: How much did she really sell the US of A for?????If you want to read up anymore on Hillary before placing your 'vote' and you want the truth, then Wikileaks explains her position best. Stay away from CNN, WaPo, Huffington..... basically ANY MEDIA!!! Again, I HOPE that I'm wrong then we can finally move forward and make America Great Again. GOD BLESS US ALL!!!#HILLARYMUSTNOTWIN#notogary#notojill#donaldtrumpforprez#makeamericagreatagain#orangeisthenewblack ;)
16 | Bruce Wilson | 0 | 10154053710020950_10154054396440950 | From an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer last Friday, about a book entitled The True Believer by Eric Hoffer: Briefly, A mass movement initially grows when a group of dissidents cry for change, change that will solve all their problems. In a pop-up mass movement, the true believer is at the heart of the matter. That person is someone marked by frustration and disillusionment with the status quo. He has been passed by, and thus is easily seduced by promises and quick solutions to all his problems. This humiliating state of mind can produce lack of self-esteem in the true believer. These dissidents who congeal into a mass movement lie in wait for the right leader to emerge; he is always a consummate preacher of "extravagant" hope and change. He brings to a boil ideas and passions already simmering in the minds of his hearers. The leader then stages the world of make-believe, evokes enthusiasm of communion, the sense of liberation from a petty and meaningless individual existence. Such a leader is described with words and phrases such as "audacity," "his the one and only truth," "a capacity for passionate hatred," "brazenness," and "delight in symbolic spectacle." The monumental self-confidence of these "charlatans," past and present, is admired by their disillusioned followers, who are willing to help "wreck" the status quo in their precipitous drive for change. Religion is essential in the true believer's system of immutable beliefs. His passionate beliefs, all truth, and all reality, are found in the "holy writ" ‚Äì "to rely on the evidence of the senses and of reason is heresy and treason." The true believer can find absolute truth only with his heart and not his mind. Generally anti-intellectual, the true believer rejects the "intellectual elite's" use of precise words that best reflect truth, preferring generalizations, slur words, and trite expressions, all seasoned with a generous proportion of trash talk. There is an "illiterate air about the most literate true believer. He uses words as if he were ignorant of their true meaning." Eric Hoffer also wrote, in 1951, "Should Americans begin to hate foreigners, it will be an indication that they have lost confidence in their own way of life."
17 | Kathy Haase | 4 | 10154053710020950_10154054150105950 | Really CBS news! Biased much? You just showed a picture and a news story of the clintons swooning over each other and now you post this! SHAME ON YOU!!! TRUMP!!!
18 | Don White | 2 | 10154053710020950_10154054028570950 | CBS is working overtime trying to smear Donald while create a fake image that Hillary is human..... Next they will publish a story about silly people that think an election can be rigged, or influenced through false, biased, agenda pushing media
19 | Teresa Baker | 2 | 10154053710020950_10154053859595950 | How anyone can vote for this misogynistic, racist, hate spewing, predator is beyond me. Not to mention his religious nut job VP choice Pence.
20 | Arthur Henline | 1 | 10154053710020950_10154054214045950 | I guess it's just to hard to report on today's news (election results) without showing partisanship. News is no longer about the news.
21 | Suzanne Wright | 0 | 10154053710020950_10154054555595950 | Where on earth did the raping women come from. The truth is he had affairs  and ran around on his wife. He was a real horn dog, but the women were right there chasing. During  the Monica  thing several sold stories to the press and trash mags, (real sweeties) If you have a week or so you can read the transcripts  of the congressional hearings. How Monica flipped her skirt up to get his attention in the Oval Office by showing her thong. How she inserted a cigar into herself and gave it to him. Yah, she was forced! It's a nasty time and he was guilty of adultery  and lying. During the whole time he was lying to the nation, congress and his wife. She believed him and stood by his side (where do you think The Good Wife came from)? I still remember a pale she'll shocked Hillary standing by him when it all come out. So Bill is not a rapist, he is your lying, cheating husband. They dropped  out of site and under went marriage counseling  with a Methodist pastor. I lived during this X-rated time in our governments history, get it right
22 | Christian Taino | 0 | 10154053710020950_10154053993930950 | Trump is the WORST thing to ever happen to America. He has made people HATE again. He has divided a nation that will take forever to heal and he has done it through his racism, hate, and bigotry. He is a con a crook and sexual pervert that belongs behind bars.
23 | Craig Scott Gray | 2 | 10154053710020950_10154053744690950 | Deb Waye --You are just one of many that are wrong with America!!First off when a homeless individual receives food stamps, they are also entitled to a free cellphone !Secondly, Don't comment on anything that you know nothing about!If you aren't walking in someone else's shoes, then you don't know what they are going through!!Don't be judging anyone without taking a good hard look at yourself!!The only time you are supposed to look down at someone is when you are reaching down to Help them up!!Just because someone is homeless doesn't mean they don't have a phone!A homeless person isn't the scum of the earth and don't deserve anything.You are essentially kicking a person while they are already down.Thirdly, It's a darn shame more people like yourself weren't taught that if you can't say anything nice, then you shouldn't say anything at all!No one is immuned from hunger and homelessness, NO ONE !!!Deb Waye
24 | Leslie A Wilderman-Hartos | 0 | 10154053710020950_10154054499885950 | Enough already...cBS! You media need to just shut up today and LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE !!! Stop trying to sway the election your way....disgusting!
25 | Greg Amerson | 5 | 10154053710020950_10154053755410950 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.
