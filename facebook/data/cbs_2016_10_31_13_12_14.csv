How about...just go about your day and mind your own P's and Q's.

The only person not in on the fix was Donald Trump, and yet he held his own. We can't even have a fair and impartial presidential debate in this country because the media and the democrats are in bed together. That is thoroughly disgusting. Thoroughly undemocratic, and thoroughly unAmerican. And of course it's much worse than that. Think about this. What kind of presidential candidate would go along with the rigging? What type of person would say, "Oh good... you got the questions... let's have those?"Hillary should have announced that questions were offered to her in advance and here's the people doing it, and I want a fair debate and I won't be a part of this.But what did she do? She covered up the crime. She accepted the rigging, kept her mouth shut, studied hard to try and make her answers look spontaneous. What kind of president would she make.... I ask you?#DrainTheSwamp

2 | Ricky Smith | 24 | 10154030572850950_10154030614435950 | Did the FBI officially closed the Clinton investigation? (No) the FBI just didn't indict..Comey did say he would inform congress if more emails showed up.... So this is just more of the same investigation.
3 | Israel Joffe | 29 | 10154030572850950_10154030623535950 | The fact that you morons still support Hillary, who's more corrupt than Boss Tweed and did nothing for women or minorities in her 30 years (based on real facts, her super predators laws she supported and the fact she did nothing as senator or secretary of state) is all truly mind boggling to me
4 | David Hinshaw | 10 | 10154030572850950_10154030687755950 | So, wait a minute. All of you Hillary Lovers praised the FBI for "doing their job" when they didn't prosecute her.  Now, you're booing the FBI for the same thing, "doing their job".  Who cares if the Election is right around the corner, the LAW IS THE LAW, regardless of what's coming up.  It was coming up when they did the FIRST investigation, and no one cried about that.  Oh, wait, it's because Hillary and her campaign had the FBI, the DOJ, and Lynch in their pocket.  Now that it all came out about the payoff to the assistant director who was in charge of her investigation in the form of a campaign contrubution to his wife, the FBI is doing what it should have done in the first place.  I'd rather they just go ahead and find her guilty now instead of her possibly winning and wasting a TON more taxpayer money on her prosecution as president, her court time, and her impeachment.
5 | Jo Novik | 6 | 10154030572850950_10154030711860950 | He was stuck between a rock and a hard place.  Keep it quiet, accused of supporting democrats, let it out, accused if supporting republicans.  He went with transparency, which is what Obama promised he would have in his administration.You folks really need to report as factually as possible without leaning politically. Be a NEWS organization
6 | Michael Glenn Laughlin | 4 | 10154030572850950_10154030665955950 | The Hatch Act was violated when a sitting president, attorney general and FBI director collaborated to block an indictment, grant immunity to the witnesses and destroy their computers. The AG, who had responsibility for determining to indict, played hot potato with the FBI director, and ordered him to claim "no prosecutor would indict." Immediately, shocked former federal prosecutors stated they would have indicted Clinton on far less evidence than the FBI criminal investigation uncovered. Lynch put Comey in that public position ... and he had no choice but to keep juggling the hot potato and notify Congress when additional information pertinent to the case was uncovered. I suspect Comey, still smarting from Lynch's ploy the first time, decided to help balance the scales of justice. Lynch should be impeached ... while standing on the tarmac at Sky Harbor Intl. Airport.
7 | Jesus Noriega | 0 | 10154030572850950_10154030802705950 | Just a few weeks ago, FBI Director James Comey was a sell-out, a corrupted official for Donald Trump and the Republicans.Just a few weeks ago, FBI Director James Comey was patriotic and serious public servant for Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.Today, the first group praises Comey as a respected man and the second group is questioning his integrity.Lessons learned?1) Politicians will say what they think would help advance their objectives. The truth is optional.2) Voters should not believe them until they have clear and substantial evidence.3) Never make a decision based on rumors, innuendos and potentially false accusations.The hot topic this week is the e-mails found in Anthony Weiner's laptop computer.Nobody knows what they are. Nobody knows to whom they were directed or who sent them.We just don't know anything about them.I think we should all take a deep breath and wait for the review to be completed before making accusations or reaching conclusions.After all, the e-mails in question may not offer anything new, and we'll be back on square one: politicians adjusting their positions, the fanatics following their madness and some common sense thoughtful citizens scratching our heads wondering when will we learn our lessons.
8 | Donald Meyers | 2 | 10154030572850950_10154030643900950 | Comey refused to even tell Congress if FBI was investigating Trump camp for Russia hack, but regular updates on Clinton are apparently A-ok. There's no case re- opened...and of course, the rethugs trying their best to deflect the scams, lawsuits, rape and perversion charges, fraud foundation and university scams from their favorite con man....Even as FBI Director James Comey was sending a letter to Congress that he knew would become public, he also privately sent a different letter to members of his own staff. Hours later, now that Comey‚Äôs public letter has been exposed as intentionally misleading and has created a firestorm of public and legal backlash against him that will almost certainly cost him his job, it turns out Comey privately admitted that he was fully aware his public letter would mislead the public.Comey‚Äôs letter sent to Congress created the false impression that the FBI was reopening its long-ago-finished investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails, for which she has already been fully exonerated. Comey made a point of failing to admit that this new investigation is actually into the behavior of former Congressman Anthony Weiner, which the media subsequently dug up on its own. Now that CNN is calling on Comey to resign from the FBI, and MSNBC is outright accusing him of intentionally trying to rig a Presidential election, his private letter to FBI employees essentially serves as a confession of guilt.In so doing, FBI Director James Comey admitted in his own words that he was fully aware that ‚Äúa brief letter and in the middle of the election season‚Äù would likely cause the ‚Äúmisleading impression‚Äù he had referenced. This now leaves Comey no ground for claiming that he didn‚Äôt know his letter to Congress would sabotage the Presidential election. This hands House Democrats the smoking gun they‚Äôve been looking for, in terms of forcing out of office...

13 | Thomas F. Coleman | 1 | 10154030572850950_10154030771360950 | Poor Hillary and the Democrats. They are the experts of October surprises.Bet they wish now they had save the Trump attack two weeks before the election, until now? Check mate, they just got burned, by their own sleazy practice, and they are crying like babies. Blame everyone else, but the person who caused this mess. Want to see what another Clinton presidency would look like, just look at the mess she has already brought, and she isn't even the President. Look at what they are willing to say and do, to any other branch of teh government, that dares cross them, and actually investigate them. They will try and destroy anyone that wants the truth!
14 | Elizabeth L Jones | 1 | 10154030572850950_10154030706850950 | To be clear: there is no acceptable excuse for James Comey‚Äôs overt, intentional violation of The Hatch Act, which Congress passed to protect our republic from future excesses of, for instance, FBI Directors, using their sweeping powers to undermine our democratic processes and free elections. The only remedy The Hatch Act allows is the immediate removal of Director Comey from his position. NOW.
15 | Tanya Lynn | 1 | 10154030572850950_10154030670220950 | So we can't all be told about all these fake ass women coming forward about supposing things Donald Trump did but we can't be told about something that Hillary did or possibly dead or that she's being investigated for? You know it seems to me that a lot of her emails have been proven that she deleted them and is lying and it's just convenient that these women are coming forward about Trump. F*** that b**** she needs to go to prison
16 | Mason Wright | 0 | 10154030572850950_10154030700520950 | Because he has decided to put his political obligations behind him and, do his job and go after someone who risked are national security.He is now facing scrutiny lol this is bs should of put her in jail the first time but at least he is righting his wrong.
17 | J Thomas Gaffney | 12 | 10154030572850950_10154030580445950 | The Democrats and Clinton campaign sensed they were losing the presidential election to Trump so they've devised this scheme to contest the election if they lose, claiming interference too close to the election under provisions of the Hatch Act. And if this doesn‚Äôt work, they‚Äôll contest the election claiming Putin and Russia interfered with the U.S. election through Wikileaks. This is all assuming that their massive vote rigging scheme fails to elect Hillary in the first place.

22 | Harriet Hill | 2 | 10154030572850950_10154030672255950 | The whole fiasco seems like a set-up by Repubs to cripple Hillary.

UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI let that sink in, If this were Trump you would be all over it saying he has to drop out...very sad how you are trying to rig the election instead of providing the American voters Journalism.
2 | Donny Vaughan | 18 | 10154030529395950_10154030627410950 | I'm a Trump supporter but I disagree with this. The FBI should release the information they have found. Reguardless of what it is we the American people have a right to know. Its too close to the end of the election not to and besides that I'm tired of hearing about these emails.  Finally put an end to it....

4 | Matthew Grace | 9 | 10154030529395950_10154030612935950 | The very existence of these emails is a problem for Clinton if there is anything classified. Weiner does not have security clearance and she is responsible for putting them within his reach.
5 | Carol Andrews | 13 | 10154030529395950_10154030575595950 | If Comey told congress in testimony this summer that he would let them know if anything new developed regarding Hillary Clinton, then what choice did he have but to write that bipartisan letter? Is it his fault then that someone leaked something they weren't supposed to? No matter how he handled this, someone would have hung him by a noose. He is also not obligated to release potential evidence in an investigation till it is finished. That's how it works. Dems demanding Weiner's laptop and all of that is not how the judicial process works. By the way, Lynch, Comey's boss is the same one to plead the 5th when it comes to billions going to Iran? She's no better than the rest of the corrupt!
6 | Rob Jones | 13 | 10154030529395950_10154030567735950 | Funny part is Hillary calling for the FBI to disclose them. The reason there's an investigation is because when she left the state dept she ignored the law that required HER to turn them over.Don't blame others for the mess you created Hil.
7 | Paul Gordon-Sheridan | 8 | 10154030529395950_10154030619535950 | This woman is the pure epitome of what the word CUNT was established for.  For the past 16 years, Republicans have shown time and time again that the ONLY WAY they can win an election is by Lying, Cheating and Stealing it, and ALWAYS blaming the Democrats for what they themselves are guilty of. This time I think people have definitely noticed the bullshit going on with them. The republicans MUST be eradicated from our political environment as soon as possible, and we must make sure that they are fully removed from power. They have proven multiple times their irresponsibility and their personal greed over what is right for our country. Enough!
8 | Stephen F. De Vellis | 12 | 10154030529395950_10154030541625950 | We all know they can't as they are part of an ongoing investigation. It's not what's in the emails that matters it's the lying to Congress and conspiracy to commit a crime
9 | Michael Glenn Laughlin | 4 | 10154030529395950_10154030675740950 | The Hatch Act was violated when a sitting president, attorney general and FBI director collaborated to block an indictment, grant immunity to the witnesses and destroy their computers. The AG, who had responsibility for determining to indict, played hot potato with the FBI director, and ordered him to claim "no prosecutor would indict." Immediately, shocked former federal prosecutors stated they would have indicted Clinton on far less evidence than the FBI criminal investigation uncovered. Lynch put Comey in that public position ... and he had no choice but to keep juggling the hot potato and notify Congress when additional information pertinent to the case was uncovered. I suspect Comey, still smarting from Lynch's ploy the first time, decided to help balance the scales of justice. Lynch should be impeached ... while standing on the tarmac at Sky Harbor Intl. Airport.

Check mate, they just got burned, by their own sleazy practice, and they are crying like babies. Blame everyone else, but the person who caused this mess. Want to see what another Clinton presidency would look like, just look at the mess she has already brought, and she isn't even the President.

15 | Teri Easton | 1 | 10154030529395950_10154030640175950 | Is Comey feeding Trump camp information? Where is she getting the numbers? First it was 3, then 1000, now 650,000? Will it be 1,300,000 by this afternoon? And 2,600,000 by tomorrow?
16 | Randy Moldenhauer | 0 | 10154030529395950_10154030820365950 | Hillary Clinton once said someone who was under FBI investigation shouldn't have been allowed to buy a gun. That's very true!!! Now someone who is also back under FBI investigation should not be allowed to run for President of the United States either. Hillary Clinton should drop out of the Presidential race immediately.

"Let the public imagination run wild! It's worth millions of campaign dollars." I'd bet that those very words have been the Trump campaign mantra.
19 | Kevin D Turner | 0 | 10154030529395950_10154030697165950 | Of course it is! They know there's nothing there...there! They know because they're complicit with Comey...I have no doubt!

20 | Tom McCool | 1 | 10154030529395950_10154030690765950 | Of course they don't care. Because they are getting way more mileage out of speculating what's in the e-mails. When the the FBI announces there is nothing in the e-mails, the Stormtrumpers will again look foolish.

8 | Olivia Triplett Wright | 15 | 10154030452025950_10154030497085950 | I just read this article on someone else's newsfeed. It's a real eye opener to say the least!Let me explain a few things to people who don't understand how this will end. People call these Muslims refugees! BS... this is an army invading our country under the assumption they are refugees. This is the only way to invade America from the inside and people say why we are strong and yes America is a super power. Killary wants to bring in 500,000 more how many are already here?. People say they are nice people I live with them and work with them, that is a red herring. Once they have enough and that will be soon if Killary is elected president. And listen to this very closely because it's no joke. Once they have the numbers here it will begin, and remember Obumer is closing Guantanamo Bay and bringing the worst of the worst Muslim leaders here to America. Why would you say does it matter well I'm going to tell you. Once the numbers are here and your "Social Security is funding all this " then they will detonate EMP bombs around America where it will do the most damage to the grid. Now some people ask what is a EMP bomb. It will destroy anything that is electrical, ie cars ,planes, generators,cell phones you get my point now. How will that be bad people ask, so I will explain . America will return to the dark ages no power to stay warm or cook no ac to stay cool no way to ship food no way to keep meat good. No place to buy food no way to call for help so people ask why would I need to call for help. Well that's when these so called refugees will turn into an Army that will start the take over of America. They will go from town to towns state to state and they will kill you cut your head's off they will rape and pillage everything and everyone they have contact with. Christians will be killed without mercy. I'll fight you say I'll call the cops or the army someone. No you won't no way to call for help phones won't work and Killary has already taken our guns so your fight won't last long. ie. Don't bring a gun to a knife fight. But don't worry Killary will set up FEMA camps for your protection she will say but many will be killed in these camps. How will you feed your family with no food no stores no walmart. So many Americans will die from starvation in the first month alone it will be sick. And then you have people in your own town that will try to take what you have to feed their's. Race groups killing and pillaging anywhere they want. America will be lost forever meanwhile all those countries that hate America will attack because we will be like sitting ducks in a pond. So prepare the best you can because this is what you are voting for if you vote this traitor as president. Some of you idiot's will laugh but I assure you when it happens it will be no laughing matter when your young girls are raped in front of you and watch as your sons and husband's heads are cut off. And no one will be able to help you you won't be able to fight because Killary took our right as American citizens all so she can fill her pockets. Obumer is Muslim plant that has brainwashed Killary into destroying the country she says she loves. Trump is our only way out of this out come so be smart people think for yourselfs and let's make America the great country it was before this traitor took control. You need to ask yourselfs why would any United States president give 400 million dollars to country like Iran that is the biggest funder of terrorist Go Trump/Pence Drain those swamps  The peaces of the puzzle are coming together to show the whole picture.  PLEASE SHARE, PLEASE
9 | Mark Tambellini | 23 | 10154030452025950_10154030489300950 | It amazes me that average working class Americans are actually buying into the most fraudulent political candidate in history speaks volumes to what I believe about the working class buying into what the Republican party has been selling for decades.....Conservative snake oil! Donald Trump is nothing more than a con artist Republican party Republican! Go look at the Republican party platform and show me where it talks specifically about the interests and rights of workers! The last thing working Americans need is the wealthiest so called billionaire capitalist to ever run for president be in charge of leading our government! Our government is not a corporation or business and shouldn't be ran like one! Government is supposed to be independent of our capitalist system, not the system in itself like it has become over the last 50 years! This is exactly what's wrong with our government. It's become a billionaires country club because wealthy people are buying the politicians to get what they want from government against the needs of the many(workers pocketbooks) and Donald Trump is as guilty as any other wealthy person in America in influencing the government into getting what he needs! How much of Trumps money over the last 40 years do you think he's spent on buying the government for himself? Trump's wealth has corrupted and rigged our political system as much as anyone else! The only thing Trump and Republicans need from ordinary workers are your uninformed votes so he and his billionaire capitalist friends can still have political control and power over OUR government and LABOR! The Republican party is NOT a PRO LABOR political party except when it's time to vote!!!!!!!!
10 | Earl Vanover | 14 | 10154030452025950_10154030499765950 | Big deal.. 650 thousand emails on Weiner's computer. Wonder where that number came from. Hillary wants to up Obama's quota of refugees by 550% may as well be 650 million.
11 | Glenn Michael | 5 | 10154030452025950_10154030546095950 | LOL his statements are a figure of speech to outline the fact that without secure borders and a proper immigration system millions *could* pour in. He's not talking in terms of absolutes.
12 | Shawn Aitchison | 5 | 10154030452025950_10154030671120950 | It seems that not one person on here talking about open borders actually understands how government works. No president can make such a thing happen by themselves. It would have to be passed by both the house and senate before such a thing could occur. Which would first require all of the politicians in congress to agree on the parameters of a bill that would allow that to happen. We all know that is something that is borderline impossible. Aside from that, no president in their right mind would allow such a thing to happen. Believing that Hillary or anyone else would do such a thing shows a complete lack of common sense or the ability for critical thinking of any kind.

"You go to work for Donald Trump thinking you're going to make it. Instead, you are robbed. Your family is Robbed. Your pension plan is Robbed. You're left high and dry with thousands of coworkers wondering how you will survive. He deliberately drains profits and cannibalizes his companies. You don't know what hit you until it's over. That is not the definition of a "smart" businessman, that is the definition of a psychopath with no conscience. I only wish the people who vote for him could experience it themselves without me having to go through it all over again".

And now they are scraping the bottom of the barrel to get something on Trump!  This week we have just witness what a Hillary Presidency would look like. Scandals cover ups, corruption, and trying to destroy anyone that dares to tell the truth or look for the truth!  Comey better be careful, people who did less than he just did have turned up dead!

Check mate, they just got burned, by their own sleazy practice, and they are crying like babies. Blame everyone else, but the person who caused this mess. Want to see what another Clinton presidency would look like, just look at the mess she has already brought, and she isn't even the President. Look at what they are willing to say and do, to any other branch of teh government, that dares cross them, and actually investigate them. They will try and destroy anyone that wants the truth!

These 6 companies use news channels to control public opinion.
22 | Scott Guiher | 3 | 10154030452025950_10154030650030950 | I don't understand why it isn't illegal for Trump to just flat lie about stuff. He makes crap up everyday that he can't backup and says that he can do all these different things that anyone with a eighth grade education knows the president doesn't have the power to do. Why isn't he under investigation?
23 | David Ogun | 1 | 10154030452025950_10154030671285950 | I believe Trump has advisers. Why do they always allow him to go out and talk like someone who has a great supplier of hard drugs and supplies his client in mega dumps? This is not good. He'll feel bad when all this ends. To think some folks would actually make the effort to go vote for a guy with such a bad case of oral diarrhea is shocking, OBAMACARE needs to do a whole lot more for mental defects :)

FBI Director James Comey faces major backlash for a new review of Clinton-related emails.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Roy Tudor | 156 | 10154030407150950_10154030411180950 | The Dems LOVED him and said how professional and upstanding he was in July when he let her go...and now....wah ....he's deplorable!!!!
2 | Norman Clifton | 113 | 10154030407150950_10154030408450950 | The Democratic Candidate for President is under FBI Investigation for numerous Federal Crimes including Espionage. Use your brain when you vote please people!We need to take our country back. Our jobs are being taken away. Our healthcare is too expensive. Mine is $600/month now (AND RISING!). My car insurance is still $25 per month (from Insurance Panda), but who knows when our increasingly socialist government will come in and muddle that up? Things are getting more and more expensive as it is. Can we really afford to support the world‚Äôs homeless?It's time we busted up the old establishment elites, the Bush's the Clintons and all the regimes that handcuff our government.
3 | Reid Davis | 34 | 10154030407150950_10154030418650950 | The Clinton campaign is scrambling and scared. They didn't even know the labtop had emails on it. Oh the joy seeing the downfall... #wikileaks promised some major news this week as well.
4 | B√§s√§m Es√§c | 48 | 10154030407150950_10154030411820950 | There once was a candidate named Clinton, Who deserves to retire at San Quentin.For lies and deceit,A beatdown complete,Orange pantsuits look good at the prison.
5 | Ricky Smith | 28 | 10154030407150950_10154030442560950 | Clinton brought all of this on herself, trying to hide records of her state department and making them private when everything she did is public information. She does not own her emails, the people do.
6 | Gary Brookshire | 21 | 10154030407150950_10154030426340950 | CBS is a joke. Attack the messenger. Let's see the scoop regarding the illegal release of Tax Returns and lack of investigative reporting on alleged attacks. CBS is a joke.
7 | Roy Straight | 25 | 10154030407150950_10154030420395950 | Really, for doing his job? Guess ol' Hillary wasn't appreciative enough when the FBI gave her a free pass the first time through. Does this new investigation now negate the deal Loretta Lynch, on behalf of the DOJ, made with slick Willie on the steps of that airplane?
8 | Steve Baird | 12 | 10154030407150950_10154030447415950 | Continue wimp liberals to attack the messenger and not the message! Bye by hag Hillary! She is completely done for! Wimp Liberals will now have to live under conservative rules and law!
9 | Fred Filkins | 3 | 10154030407150950_10154030458390950 | the corrupt republican who runs the FBI just decided to help his party's candidate‚Ä¶ Comey is just a tool of Washington's GOP house and their endless committee investigations‚Ä¶ its a corrupt system folks‚Ä¶ insiders are trying to steal your vote‚Ä¶ if we lose it proves this election is rigged..and the corrupt media is helping to spread this lie.. look back there.. liars, all of them..
10 | Bonnie Jean | 11 | 10154030407150950_10154030449070950 | And if the shoe was on the other foot and he didn't do it, folks would be screaming for his head! Let the man do his job. Back in July he was applauded by the same group who are now condemning him. No need to cause a fuss if there is nothing to hide or any wrong doing.
11 | Chris Janik | 7 | 10154030407150950_10154030463215950 | I love how Clinton's first comments were that the FBI needed to tell her what they had, under the pretense of coming clean to the public.If she was worried about the public knowing what she said in those emails, she could just tell us herself.
12 | Darrin Richards | 6 | 10154030407150950_10154030464225950 | The crooked corrupt democratic establishment is NOW furious with James Comey whom Hillary Clinton herself and Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch, Barack Obama and every liberal news media outlet praised and recounted James Comey's stellar professionalism and he concrete integrity record.
13 | John Judy Borrell | 2 | 10154030407150950_10154030715380950 | Good luck with that Hillary you've only got 8 days left to play your games the New York office is involved in the FBI investigation and they operate very differently previous investigations I think we're going to see some real hard evidence come out it's just a matter of time.
14 | Elizabeth L Jones | 5 | 10154030407150950_10154030457905950 | To be clear: there is no acceptable excuse for James Comey‚Äôs overt, intentional violation of The Hatch Act, which Congress passed to protect our republic from future excesses of, for instance, FBI Directors, using their sweeping powers to undermine our democratic processes and free elections. The only remedy The Hatch Act allows is the immediate removal of Director Comey from his position. NOW.
15 | John Spencer | 3 | 10154030407150950_10154030685955950 | Major Backlash ? Are you shitting me ? Clinton can cry, piss and moan all she wants, she really has no say in the matter and is doing nothing but trying to stall the investigation so she can destroy evidence, witnesses and get her Lies straight.
16 | Jim Williams | 0 | 10154030407150950_10154030890615950 | Unless the new emails reveal that Clinton cheated on three spouses, molested a dozen men, ripped off hundreds of workers and contractors and investors, defrauded hundreds of students, mocked a handicapped reporter, lost a billion on a casino in 1995 when the economy was booming, is going to court for fraud and raping a 13 year old boy, and used the money from her foundation to line her own pockets and bribe two attorneys general, I'm sticking with Hillary.

19 | John M. Sullivan | 1 | 10154030407150950_10154030723180950 | Given the backlash, I wonder not that it's Monday, it Comey wishes he could crawl under a rock today? You know... That given what Mr. Comey did last week, breaks FBI protocol, Insinuates guilt and association without seeing the evidence, assumes she's guilty without a trial, and violates the Hatch Act of interfering with the election process!I have a feeling Mr. Comey is in the 'hot-seat' now, and maybe facing charges himself!  If not, being forced to step down.  You would think that these people who believe that they are so smart, don't stop to think about their actions and assumptions better!
20 | Michael Glenn Laughlin | 0 | 10154030407150950_10154030672975950 | The Hatch Act was violated when a sitting president, attorney general and FBI director collaborated to block an indictment, grant immunity to the witnesses and destroy their computers. The AG, who had responsibility for determining to indict, played hot potato with the FBI director, and ordered him to claim "no prosecutor would indict." Immediately, shocked former federal prosecutors stated they would have indicted Clinton on far less evidence than the FBI criminal investigation uncovered. Lynch put Comey in that public position ... and he had no choice but to keep juggling the hot potato and notify Congress when additional information pertinent to the case was uncovered. I suspect Comey, still smarting from Lynch's ploy the first time, decided to help balance the scales of justice. Lynch should be impeached ... while standing on the tarmac at Sky Harbor Intl. Airport.

22 | Carol Andrews | 7 | 10154030407150950_10154030442480950 | If Comey told congress in testimony this summer that he would let them know if anything new developed regarding Hillary Clinton, then what choice did he have but to write that bipartisan letter? Is it his fault then that someone leaked something they weren't supposed to? No matter how he handled this, someone would have hung him by a noose. He is also not obligated to release potential evidence in an investigation till it is finished. That's how it works. Dems demanding Weiner's laptop and all of that is not how the judicial process works. By the way, Lynch, Comey's boss is the same one to plead the 5th when it comes to billions going to Iran? She's no better than the rest of the corrupt!
23 | Bubba John Hogwaller | 0 | 10154030407150950_10154030851015950 | It's not a new review of existing evidence, it's newly found evidence due to Anthony Weiner's perversion for young girls, Huma signed a document stating she had turned over every device containing any State Department related materials, well, she didn't!  Thanks Anthony, you may have just provided the very evidence Hillary and her I.T. cronies attempted to zero out using bleach bit........
24 | Laura Harrington | 1 | 10154030407150950_10154030626215950 | Mr. James Comey you stay the course and do your job regardless of the out come that's what the American taxpayers expect and thank you for standing up against the others because they are ass kissers to the Obuma Regime and Clinton. When personnel of the government or a company decide to do what's right instead of worrying most about what's gonna happen to them personally this country and its people would be a hell of alot better off.
25 | Brian Steinke | 0 | 10154030407150950_10154030441315950 | Personally I feel for Comey, notifies congress that they may have found more E-mails related to the congressional investigation - gets hammered by the (d) side....... waits until after the election to tell congress that they found the E-mails (prior to teh election) - most likely gets hammered by the (r)....

3 | Gary Brookshire | 10 | 10154030371685950_10154030402690950 | Great scoop. Hillary doesn't recall and neither does Huma. What a suprising scoop!How long are you going to protect Bill and Hillary Inc.?
4 | Charley Faulkner | 8 | 10154030371685950_10154030397835950 | I'll be so glad when this election is over and Hillary is president. Then the cockroaches that Trump brought out can scurry back under the fridge where they belong.

It's always the cover up that gets them in the end!  The people sitting in prison for far less than what these two have done, must be felling better, watching this fiasco!
8 | Pete Shaw | 4 | 10154030371685950_10154030430040950 | How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care.Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection.After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations.She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply.She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation.Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense.Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . .She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?)After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

14 | Sasha Bens | 3 | 10154030371685950_10154030412900950 | Or....the FBI could have gone through the emails first and determine the nature of them first...before calling for a witch hunt this close the the election...but that would be logical.

18 | Denise Spencer | 5 | 10154030371685950_10154030403295950 | Dear Right Wing Media:The war crimes of Bush are not the same as Hillary's emails.The republican treason of Iran Contra does not compare to republicans White Water investigation of Bill Clinton.
19 | Michael Larabell | 0 | 10154030371685950_10154030823070950 | What do we know about the candidates? Not what the media wants us to believe. Hillary used a private server to conduct business as the Secretary of State. Huma's computer has email on it that connects to the Hillary FBI email investigation. Hillary is currently under investigation with the FBI.She gave speeches for $225,000 a piece but banned the press from them. The Clinton Foundation has taken donations from middle eastern countries while she was the Secretary of State. No one from the democratic party has come forward to deny any of the WikiLeaks and the media refuses to cover them. When it is mentioned, the subject is changed or the cameraman cuts the camera off or moves on to something else.What we know about Trump.An audio recording was released from 2005 with trump acting like a pig. That was used and several women came forward with stories from years ago accusing Trump of groping them. This was never proven but played over and over again and he has been found guilty by media. Trump owned rental properties in the early 70's and the government sued him for not renting apartments in "one" of his developments to African-Americans. This is true, however do you believe that Trump personally handles any of the rental properties himself? If it involved many of his properties, then I would be concerned that it was a cooperate issue. Since Trump is the owner, of course he would be the one to get sued. Ask yourself, does that make Trump a racist or is it the bombardment from the media making it look that way?With Hillary, we have proven facts along with the media withholding information. With Trump we have someone acting like a pig on an audio recording and accusations from women claiming Trump groped them many years ago and the media withholding information.Most everything else we see on social media is he said she said that can be taken with a grain of salt and not reliable. It is sad that people are not opening their eyes and just taking the word of what they hear on TV and read on social media. It is sad that we have women who are voting for Hillary just because they want to see a woman in the White House and just as sad that men would vote for Trump solely because they do not want a woman in the Whitehouse. It is sad that our media is not reporting the news as they should and give the people all the facts and not slant it to the left or the right.The USA used to be the most reliable news in the world. Now the world sees our media as biased and who can blame them.
20 | Rick Ustler | 1 | 10154030371685950_10154030413930950 | The plot thickens. First an investigation into Weiner, year after the crime. Then the revolation that some smoking gun been found. Then the clarification, well not really a smoking gun more like a closed gun rack with a possible gun inside. Now the, wait that gun rack not even in my house so what the hell you talking about. Come on Comey, maybe you should announce a smoking gun been found on your wife computer so you'll be opening up a investiagation just before the election. Talk about your conspiracy to fix an election, who investigates an apparent crook when the crook the head of the FBI. Certainly won't be Fuhrrer Trump if that Nazi gets in.
21 | Sherry Barbour Bell | 1 | 10154030371685950_10154030400060950 | Bernstein, the FBI would not reopen the case this close to the election unless a ‚Äúreal bombshell‚Äù had been revealed in the Huma Abedin/Anthony Weiner emails, per RealClearPolitics.com. Bernstein also agreed that the greatest threat to Clinton‚Äôs continued quest for power has been those emails.Moreover, Hillary‚Äôs actions surrounding the emails have infuriated both sides of aisle, and Americans of every political leaning. During Watergate, the break-in was bad but the cover-up is what did Nixon in and forced him to resign. The same goes for Hillary‚Äôs emails.

After all, they have been in the public eye‚Äîfrom Arkansas to the White House and beyond‚Äîfor over forty years.Dolly Kyle met former president Clinton (Billy as she calls him) on a Hot Springs golf course when she was eleven and he was almost thirteen. It was colpo de fulmine (the thunderbolt) at first sight. Their friendship grew throughout high school and college. It became a decades-long affair that lasted despite marriages and politics all the way to the threshold of the White House‚Äîwhen she became a political liability, and he threatened to destroy her, as Hillary had done to so many of his other women over the years. What you know about the Clintons is probably limited to the pleasantries that the mainstream media have chosen to share with you. Hillary the Other Woman pulls no punches in describing the way ‚Äúmedia magic‚Äù makes Clinton stories disappear.Have you heard aboutThe RICO (Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) federal lawsuit that Kyle filed against Clinton and cronies while he and co-president Hillary were in the White House?The racial discrimination lawsuits filed by African-Americans against Clinton as governor of Arkansas?Clinton‚Äôs orders for the Arkansas State Police to ‚Äústop and search‚Äù vehicles driven by Hispanics?Thousands of young African-American men given long prison sentences under the ‚Äúthree strikes‚Äù laws pushed by co-presidents Bill and Hillary?The co-president Clintons pandering to minorities with a subtle form of race baiting with their welfare agenda?The racist names they call Jesse Jackson behind his back?Hillary the Other Woman is not only about the politics of the Arkansas gubernatorial years and the famous ‚Äútwo for the price of one‚Äù presidency. It also provides a perspective on Arkansas life that formed the backdrop and training ground for the Clintons in their later crimes, their gangster-like threats and intimidation of political enemies, and their arrogant belief that they are above the law. You will see the connection between Hillary‚Äôs current email scandal and her shredding of documents when they left the Arkansas governor‚Äôs mansion. You will realize that the Clinton Foundation is the new international version of the money laundering and bribes that you glossed over as ‚ÄúCattlegate.‚Äù You will read clear, concise, entertaining accounts that put the multitude of Clinton scandals into everyday perspective. Finally, you will be privy to the Clinton ‚Äútruth suppression‚Äù techniques that allowed them to get away with all of it.

Former Attorney General Eric Holder is blasting his former colleague FBI Director James Comey for violating long-standing Justice Department policies.

6 | Jeff Trawick | 21 | 10154030335790950_10154030367145950 | Eric Holder was plagued by The Fast and Furious scandal. The corrupt Washington cartel will always stand up for their corrupt cohorts.
7 | Jim Beller | 15 | 10154030335790950_10154030361075950 | An AG that was held in Contempt of Congress, has no credibility to me, regarding his interpretation of the law fairly.

We know that Hillary completely disregarded a subpoena from congress and willfully and blatantly destroyed her emails that were subpoenaed.  That is obstruction of justice a felony. You and I would go to jail for this crime. Our president is campaigning for a felon, does that tell you anything? Think about that, why is his legacy that important to him that he would completely disregards crimes being committed under his administration that completely goes against our constitution and the sovereignty of this nation. Or is he involved in this cover up, either way he is also corrupt. If we allow this to continue it will get even worse. Ask the Venezuelan people, or any other banana republic society. Wake up America. VOTE!!!!

Want to see what another Clinton presidency would look like, just look at the mess she has already brought, and she isn't even the President.

21 | Michael Glenn Laughlin | 1 | 10154030335790950_10154030673615950 | The Hatch Act was violated when a sitting president, attorney general and FBI director collaborated to block an indictment, grant immunity to the witnesses and destroy their computers. The AG, who had responsibility for determining to indict, played hot potato with the FBI director, and ordered him to claim "no prosecutor would indict." Immediately, shocked former federal prosecutors stated they would have indicted Clinton on far less evidence than the FBI criminal investigation uncovered. Lynch put Comey in that public position ... and he had no choice but to keep juggling the hot potato and notify Congress when additional information pertinent to the case was uncovered. I suspect Comey, still smarting from Lynch's ploy the first time, decided to help balance the scales of justice. Lynch should be impeached ... while standing on the tarmac at Sky Harbor Intl. Airport.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Denise Noto | 63 | 10154030295135950_10154030306125950 | Let us not forget the reason these 'damn emails' became an issue. A Congressional investigation into the attack in Benghazi, Libya on 9/11/2012, which resulted in the deaths of Amb. Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods. Four Americans died! Congress instructed Hillary Clinton to turn over all emails for the period of time leading up to this tragedy. As part of the Congressional investigation, it was discovered that Hillary Clinton was using an unauthorized email server. Clinton said she turned over everything. She didn't. The families of the four men who died deserve to know the truth. The American people deserve to know the truth. Hillary trying to play the victim and downplay the importance of the information contained in the emails she refused to turn over, is disgusting. So, yeah, the 'damn emails' are important.
2 | Precinda Bjorgen | 11 | 10154030295135950_10154030321430950 | Every woman and democrat knows what this is all about with Comey. I want you to know Comey "women" know what you are trying to pull. CBS News "Please do your best to investigate this horrific Comey action." Not cool...
3 | Rob Verk | 5 | 10154030295135950_10154030404715950 | Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private email server illegal, it ‚Äúdisqualifies‚Äù her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.So here‚Äôs the one law you need to know that should terminate her presidential campaign:For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here‚Äôs what it says:‚Äù(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.

Is it his fault then that someone leaked something they weren't supposed to? No matter how he handled this, someone would have hung him by a noose.

Hillary now needs to stop blaming everyone and everything take responsibility and step down so we can get either Biden or Sanders back in the race and still have a chance to keep this country held together.

23 | Pete Shaw | 0 | 10154030295135950_10154030433420950 | How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care.Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection.After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations.She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply.She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation.Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense.Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . .She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?)After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

Major companies are laying off your family members, friends and neighbors by the ‚Äúthousands‚Äù. The companies below are just a ‚Äúfew‚Äù that are reaping the rewards of a huge tax credit and replacing your family and friends with, refugees and green cards workers, with the H1-B program. Wave those smart arms, and say‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm with her, Tell you family and friends to screw off. Trump might not be the best candidate, but at least he is trying to say you from the unemployment line. Yes Hillary‚Äôs said she will create thousands of jobs, she just forgot to mention the are for refugees and green card holders.Hewlett Packard announced this week that the company plans to cut about 10% of its workforce, roughly around 30,000 American workers, while expanding the use of H-1B foreign worker visas. HP Chairman and CEO Meg Whitman said, "We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring."Cisco Systems, Inc., a giant tech company, plans on laying off 5,500 employees or about 7% of its global workforce starting in the next few weeks. The Cisco company has been a champion for increasing H-1B visas and is currently the 28th biggest user of H-1Bs in the U.S.Intel announced that it will layoff 12,000 American workers after requesting 14,523 H-1B visas and green cards to import foreign workers. The company said the layoffs are part of a "restructuring" plan to move the company's focus to mobile devices, yet only American workers will be affected.Mc Donalds has joined the growing national trend of outsourcing American jobs to cheaper, foreign workers. The McDonalds in Ohio fired 70 American accountants and replaced them foreign, H-1B workers.Caterpillar is firing 300 American employees in Mossville, Illinois, even though it is ... Caterpillar's combination of white-collars layoffs and H-1B ... reduce or stop various outsourcing programs, such as the H-1B visa. ‚ÄúWhat we see is that companies ask for more [H-1B visas] while they're laying off the same ... Dell applied for 2,039 H-1B visas and 256 Green Cards. ... It's the hot thing to do for tech companies: laying off existing workers in ..... they will all be running the same data through similar programs.Hillary Clinton is promising to expand companies‚Äô hiring of foreign blue-collar and white-collar workers.

Epstein, an associate of the UK‚Äôs Prince Andrew who was convicted of underage sex crimes in Florida in 2008, has also denied the allegations.A Guardian investigation this summer found that the lawsuit appeared to have been coordinated by a former producer on the Jerry Springer TV show who has been associated in the past with a range of disputed claims involving celebrities including OJ Simpson and Kurt Cobain. A publicist acting for ‚ÄúJane Doe‚Äù also attempted to sell a video in which the woman describes her allegations against Trump to media outlets at a $1m price tag.The court order gives no details of the legal complaint raised by ‚ÄúJane Doe‚Äù. It instructs all parties to the case to set out in advance the nature of the allegations and the ‚Äúprincipal defenses‚Äù, as well as any previous motions and discovery as well as the ‚Äúestimated length of trial‚Äù.The original federal lawsuit, filed in June, alleged that ‚ÄúJane Doe‚Äù was sexually assaulted by Trump in 1994 at Epstein‚Äôs Manhattan home. Further claims were made that the real estate billionaire raped the then teenager at parties hosted by Epstein on the Upper East Side.

Just 3 months ago, Hillary and all the Dems were praising Comey. Now they want to hang him. Comey is not the problem. Hillary is. The FBI got a warrant to search Anthony Weiner‚Äôs laptop for new evidence in the Hillary Clinton email scandal, setting off a mad dash to try and finish the massive job before Election Day. There are around 650,000 emails stored on it, with many from Abedin‚Äôs accounts.Agents have probable cause to search only those that relate to the Clinton probe, and they‚Äôre only expected to seize a portion of the huge cache.

18 | Matthew Byrne | 1 | 10154029921420950_10154029936315950 | The cause of terrorism is the United States' history of "greedy military interventions." It's the greed of trans-national corporations not the American people. We can end this war and actually prevent terrorism by changing our foreign policy and using more diplomacy. U.S. foreign trade policy currently focuses on business interests at the expense of workers rights. The low wages etc. cause the outsourcing of U.S. jobs and illegal immigration. We do not need to build a wall. The answer is to gradually increase wages and regulations there, not lowering our wages and regulations. The interest of big-business do not have to conflict with workers' rights and environment protection. Higher buying power will indeed increase business sales and expand the economy.Jill Stein For President and Down-Ballot "Berniecrats"

They can say no!Good for them!Importing the problems of those countries solves nothing for them, as a whole.

5 | Caryn Dalton | 13 | 10154029778970950_10154030059530950 | As I see it, we need to go back and put blame on Bush and Cheney, they sent us to war which never should have happened, now all of this is happening and you are blaming Obama and Clinton. They inherited Bush and Cheney's mess that put us into where we are now!
6 | Tristan MacLean | 2 | 10154029778970950_10154030075875950 | It makes sense if you come illegally seeking asylum and the immigration process rejects you why should you get a infinite kicks at the can as a tourist, but I wonder how many would do it.  Its sounds like a law motivated by fear not reality or maybe there was one crazy asylum seeker who keep pushing the system.

9 | Lisa Thurman | 2 | 10154029778970950_10154029974490950 | Maybe its a good thing they aren't taking immigrants because the last time they took in a bunch of children that wasn't theirs, they abused, tortured and killed them.
10 | Jason Eugenides | 1 | 10154029778970950_10154030332595950 | The fact is that America created all of these problems by destabilizing the middle east....to act all offended that refugees are at the door seems pretty ignorant, pathetic and sad.

The legalization of recreational marijuana is on the ballot in five states in the upcoming election.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Erick C√≥rtez | 56 | 10154029662995950_10154029678890950 | Wether it becomes legal or no people are going to keep consuming it. Why not regulate it's sale make revenue out of that can be put to good use.
2 | Sergio Angel | 20 | 10154029662995950_10154029806800950 | That's money ready to be made, people with bad eyes, other injuries and illnesses and also for active and former military veterans, firefighters, law enforcement officers can benefit from using marijuana to treat the symptoms of PTSD and other psychological disorders. It's much safer than pills.
3 | Lan Nguyen Ullrich | 11 | 10154029662995950_10154029853915950 | It's only a matter of time and effort. Sadly, the pharmaceutical industry is downright exorbitant amounts of money to combat this initiative that benefit so many in a safer way.
4 | Michael Shippole | 10 | 10154029662995950_10154030085295950 | Did they call prohibition 'recreational alcohol'? Lol. These media conglomerates never stop using their platform to alter public opinion. If consenting adults want to use marijuana responsibly  the same way consenting adults want to drink alcohol responsibly who is the government to say they can't? We all are very well aware prohibition was a complete failure and when repealed has led to an incredibly successful industry. Removing it from an illegal trade to a legal one replaced the ambiguity of not knowing if it's safe to use, stopped incriminating hundreds of thousands of non criminal acts, created hundreds of thousands of jobs instead, and a huge tax base. It's time for the next generation to step forward and bring back the independence the last generation sold out.

( I say Jack up the prices because it is not a necessity and is a recreational substance, also believe we should do that with cigarettes and alcohol)
8 | Justin Calderon | 3 | 10154029662995950_10154030247555950 | Guys i have not and never will smoke but we need to make it legal but we also need to make it mandatory that we only produce (grow) it here! Look at the millions of jobs leaving our country we need to keep this new future jackpot here!

10 | Paul Wilson | 0 | 10154029662995950_10154030206930950 | Come on quit throwing people in jail and tax the crap out of it. Alcohol is twice as bad as pot kills and addicts millions each year. I put it on the same level as Meth.

12 | Kyle Butler | 1 | 10154029662995950_10154030442805950 | Doesn't matter either way. Cannabis is as readily available as coffee in most states. The only real question is whether your state decides to get in on the revenue or continue to allow criminal organizations to collect. It's that simple.

They‚Äôre tested positive. Obviously, they know they‚Äôve been smoking marijuana, but they‚Äôre in disbelief that it‚Äôs harmful. They frequently say, ‚ÄúHow can it be harmful? It‚Äôs a legal drug.‚ÄùDr. Simerville says that‚Äôs a common misconception, especially because 25 states have approved marijuana for medical use; for conditions like epilepsy, pain and stimulation of appetite.  But on the federal level, it‚Äôs still illegal.  Today‚Äôs pot is on average four to five times stronger than it was in the 1980s.  It can also get passed on to babies in high concentrations in breast milk.

Over the past 20 years, the "Spirit Halloween" poll has correctly predicted every presidential election winner -- based on the top-selling mask.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Shawn Turney | 319 | 10154029440400950_10154029458140950 | Not exactly scientific data, since there have only been 3 presidents in the past 20 years. Plus, more men are likely to wear masks than women. So of course Trump is ahead... not to mention the fact that clown masks are big sellers anyway.
2 | Cassandra Rodriguez | 224 | 10154029440400950_10154029445840950 | Except this year people are buying the mask to make fun of the candidates
3 | Channel Whine News | 70 | 10154029440400950_10154029443185950 | I thought the media said there were fears for people dressing up as clowns this year for Halloween?
4 | Jordan Ryan | 35 | 10154029440400950_10154029489180950 | And if you can't afford the Trump mask. Wrap yourself in a cheap suit, pack pillows around your waste, plop a pumpkin on your head and go around grabbing woman in the P#$$!
5 | Edgardo Obregon | 43 | 10154029440400950_10154029455870950 | This year, Trump's masks are been burned or tossed in the garbage can after usage. Trump's image is seeing as the devil here.
6 | Alex Alvarado | 19 | 10154029440400950_10154029508700950 | Copy from Facebook page of Kevin M Carney(opposing Views.) A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!
7 | Erick C√≥rtez | 9 | 10154029440400950_10154029532500950 | I have a conspiracy theory to latch onto those of Donald Trump's that he has been talking about: Like Donald Trump I do believe this election is rigged but in a different way. I believe the master minds behind are this rigged election are Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump. And they are fooling everyone into believing they are at each other throats. Just think how they been talking about how Donald hasn't been paying any taxes and take advantage of the loophole the same loophole that Hilary hasn't even tried to close. So if Clinton wins Donald Trump won't lose cause she'll keep forgetting on closing those loopholes and Donald Trump will keep on used them to his benefit. Don't be surprise if at the end of this election the Clinton's and the Trump's become best friends again.

9 | Tammy Mccoy | 3 | 10154029440400950_10154029937760950 | In view of the widening e-mail scandal, sliding poll numbers, questions related to influence peddling via the Clinton Foundation while Secretary of State, and concerns regarding her health, Democrats should seriously consider having Hillary withdraw from the campaign.
10 | TerriAnn Clidence Arrington | 3 | 10154029440400950_10154030288725950 | Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:‚Äú(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.‚ÄùYes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that?

[Not at all suspicious behavior, right?]Just fyi... Innocent people don't run to the bathroom and start furiously flushing the toilet when the DEA knocks at the door. Hillary created this scandal all by herself.

We will elect an insecure, unqualified, small, vindictive, corrupt man. The Clinton defensiveness started with the Clinton's *losing* 40k in the Whitewater land deal, and after 45 MILLION of wasted tax payer money of intense, politically motivated investigations, there was nothing to use to prosecute the Clintons. But they used it to ask the sitting President about sex under oath! The real story is the mud we have to dredge in this gossipy, constantly investigating culture when Republicans don't win. In fact, that would be a good book title: When Republicans Don't Win. They obstruct and character assasinate, block progress, and block Supreme Court appointments!

20 | Pete Shaw | 0 | 10154029440400950_10154030436675950 | How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care.Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection.After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations.She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply.She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation.Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense.Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . .She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?)After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
21 | JJ Brown | 0 | 10154029440400950_10154030336835950 | If this "mask index" said the opposite the headline would be "Hillary is going to win based on the last 20 years of Halloween mask production in china"...

1 | Glen More | 1 | 10154029373370950_10154029419435950 | From Gene Sargent: Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.

This stuff really doesn‚Äôt affect our quality of life. We loss focus of the issues that will affect our life and our children‚Äôs life for decades. Health care (ObamaCare vs appeal ObamaCare), taxes (higher/lower), appointment of 1 to 3 Supreme Court Judges (liberal/conservative) and appointment of 100+ Federal Judges (liberal/conservative), Medicare and Social Security running out of money, national debit (higher/lower), border security (no wall/wall), country security (same as usual/extreme vetting), trade (same deals TPP & TAFTA/equitable trade deals), Illegal immigrants (make them legal with path to citizenship/no legalization & no path to citizenship), refugees (allow more to come into country/stop flow of refugees until congress can come up with a better vetting system) and government (larger/smaller). These are the real issue that need fixing that will affect our life and our children‚Äôs life for decades to come. We need to stop focusing on the short comings of each candidate. Focus on the real issues!

6 | Wade Youngblood | 2 | 10154029313970950_10154029324695950 | Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US-made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn‚Äôt arm the missile and the Chinook didn‚Äôt explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA.Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a ‚Äúdo-or-die‚Äù mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn‚Äôt supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK‚Äôd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video.Obama and Hillary committed treason‚Ä¶and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not.Further‚Ä¶the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn‚Ä¶everyone KNEW he was a traitor.So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt but compromised‚Ä¶and a woman who is a serial liar perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing who is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in‚Ä¶because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers.Send this again and again and again until everyone reads this truth. Our nation depends on people getting the TRUTH, instead of the pack of lies being fed to us by Corrupt Obama and Clinton and the Corrupt News Media .

Here's a thought if your town is so dang scared of "creepy clowns" why not come up with something different then door to door for your children to enjoy! Hold a trunk or treat at a local park or football stadium, something that is all in 1 area and can be secured for the most part.

20 | Uuiyre Uuiyre | 0 | 10154029272195950_10154030242870950 | There are 650,000 emails on Huma's / hubbys computer....it is mathematically impossible they are all hers...Sources say FBI says looked at some....also it appears Huma copied all Clinton emails including the 33,000 Hillary had deleted. Not disclosed why she did this on hubbys computer. Sources say Huma's lawyers are talking with FBI...hence the reason she is not with Clinton.
