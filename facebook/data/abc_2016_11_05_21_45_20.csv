With such a record why and how was he ever been able to live outside the prison system.The whole entire justice system needs to be revamped to keep repeat felons inside of prison or give them the death penalty and.kill them.within a month of.sentencing. Instead of sitting on death row for 20 years are more. And make them serve their entire prison sentence that they are giben. No breaks for good behavior etc. Criminals today don't mind going to prison because if they are good and sentenced example: 25 years to life means in about 6 to 8 years they get out on parole after being.convicted for.awful.felony.charges.

Yes, I do agree Trump has said some nasty things, however, he NEVER got any service members killed then lied about it! This woman (and I use that term loosely) has lied, scheme, cheated, sold our country, lined her pockets, sold out the American people, broke laws, committed treasonous acts, attacked women, defended child rapists, took money from countries that kill homosexuals and treat women as nothing more than cattle, took money from countries that stone and behead woman and young girls for what they call the "crime" of being raped. Not to mention the man that she called her "mentor" was a high ranking KKK official. The list goes on and on. If this is your choice, YOU are willing participants of the destruction of this country. You are useless. You have been bought and sold. You have no conscience. You have no soul. You are a huge part of the problem. Explain the state of this country to your friends, family, coworkers, and loved ones when they look at you for peddling these lies and they figure out you sold them out. This is a sad day and you are a pathetic excuse for journalist. I weep for this country.

When you live in a country that has over 400 Billionaires, but still havehomeless people, even children, in the streets living in tents and cardboard boxes, it is not so great.Why does the top 1% of the people in the country have more wealththan the bottom 70%?Why is it, the owner of Wal-Mart has made Billions of dollars, butthe workers who do the work, have wages so low that they needto be on food stamps?Why do we have a government that caters to and is bought and ownedby the rich and big corporation, instead of a government of thepeople, for the people, and by the people?Change, when you feel America is great, you do not believe in change.As they say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.I don't know about you and Hillary, but I think it's broke and itis time for someone to fix it.America, I have only one question, come November, are you ready to fix it.

Campaining with Mike Pence in Wisconsin, Speaker Paul Ryan says he voted for Donald J. Trump and that it's time for Republicans to "come home" http://abcn.ws/2f56QmU

1 | Tyrone Terry | 313 | 10154982625778812_10154982645563812 | He put his party over his country. However, I'm not surprised one bit. Republicans have turned into the obstructionist party who's trying to hold America hostage and forcefeed  us their conservative agenda.
2 | Cathy Mason Kilgore | 263 | 10154982625778812_10154982641548812 | Come home to what? Hate ugly disrespect for one another?? Paul Ryan seriously please
3 | Nick McGargill | 140 | 10154982625778812_10154982659758812 | No. I tore my Republican card the moment Trump was nominated. Its because I stick by my principles. I didn't leave the Republican Party, the Republican Party left me, and thank God for it.

6 | Chantal Miro | 67 | 10154982625778812_10154982635983812 | Paul Ryan and republicans best job for the american people, do nothing and obstructionist!
7 | David Soliz | 35 | 10154982625778812_10154982662353812 | Useless. The republican held house and senate have become useless. They need to stop thinking party and think America! Where did it all go wrong?
8 | Julie Lucas Runco | 17 | 10154982625778812_10154982713328812 | Why should the Republicans come home to a broken home ? Trump has disrespected the honored Republican Party and made it into a hate mongering group.. and that's not the Republicans I knew growing up.. He has them fleeing for a reason.. The ones fleeing have consciouses and dignity and intelligence beyond Trumps comprehension, he has tarnished the history of the GOP. I may be a Democrat and voting for Hillary.. But my Uncle and other family members are Republicans in which we always had lively and respectful conversations about elections..always.. I loved my Uncle.. but even he can't stand his party this year. Next time he said, next time if the party chooses a candidate I can back.. he'll vote again Republican. Until then he's voting for Hillary and that's that.
9 | Curtis Munsey | 12 | 10154982625778812_10154982656868812 | I will simply say that the same people who love Trump were the same people saying Obama couldn't ever carry through on all of his campaign promises... hello? Still there? Congress still exists regardless of who wins. This isn't middle school where "because I said so..." is a credible response when pushed for details on HOW you will do the things you say.

13 | Frank Collins | 14 | 10154982625778812_10154982647523812 | Paul Ryan should have backed Donald J. Trump months ago. He doesn't care about the will of the people. He only cares about his job and his friends jobs.
14 | Junior Rosa | 4 | 10154982625778812_10154982726543812 | When The Trump Campaign sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're sending rapists. They're sending white trash. They're sending low life hypocrats. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems to us. They're bringing hate. They're bringing lies. They're deplorable and some, I assume are good people.".
15 | Billy Ancheta | 2 | 10154982625778812_10154982719328812 | Paul Ryan alongside with Mitch McConnell, and Ted Cruz are a few prime examples of politicians with no backbones. I can see right through them...how can the so called conservatives support Trump?

17 | Kayla Jones | 7 | 10154982625778812_10154982701838812 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 8 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.PLEASE SHARE !!
18 | Shirley Stafford- Copperwheat | 4 | 10154982625778812_10154982716773812 | I'm really wondering why people are voting for Clinton. Do you really like Kaine that much because he will probably be the president as Hillary is in prison.
19 | Tina Jones | 0 | 10154982625778812_10154982710183812 | Paul Ryan is actually campaigning for Pence. Ryan dislikes Trump, can't support him, yet voted for him. If Trump is elected, he will be impeached quickly. Many GOP members have said they can't support Trump but are voting for him. This will give the GOP the President they are looking for, Mike Pence. He has the same values as they do.
20 | Lynn Theresa | 0 | 10154982625778812_1115189735261918 | I liked him better when he was standing up for his principles, now he caved in to the pressure of the extremists. Sorry Paul Ryan, I cannot vote for a Presidency of hatred, disrespect of women, bullying and racism. HOW CAN YOU?

22 | Kimberly R Cook | 5 | 10154982625778812_10154982648598812 | Didnt Ryan tweet the C word in ref. to Hillary 2 days ago ? I think the republicans in Washinton are praying this A-hole loses.
23 | Kirsten Johnson | 1 | 10154982625778812_10154982882008812 | Shake my head!! Seriously Paul Ryan?? I honestly thought you are better then that. This shows that you have no back bone whatsoever!
24 | Steven Kingsley | 0 | 10154982625778812_1115188918595333 | If donald trump represents the Republican party then it's already dead. The gop said they were the family values party. Nominating trump speaks volumes on what those values are.
25 | Samson Rajkumar | 20 | 10154982625778812_10154982634898812 | Mrs. Clinton might have star power, but Mr. Trump has support of American people. Let's vote Trump and elect him as our 45th President of the United States.

2 | Lorenzo Mateo | 81 | 10154982523433812_10154982550693812 | Trump should goes to jail for rape and Chris Christie should goes to jail for the shutdown of the bridge. Put them side beside.
3 | Bob Reese | 40 | 10154982523433812_10154982599468812 | Lock him up!Trump during the primaries said he knew about all this and Christie investigated himself to no finding of guilt. Wouldn't the Republicans be all over Hillary or any Democrat in a similar situation.Hypocrsy or what!

5 | Daniel Rodriguez | 35 | 10154982523433812_10154982527558812 | I'm completely and utterly confused... how can a candidate for president who is under 2 active FBI criminal investigations even be able to continue campaigning at this point?! Have we no decency as a nation?! She's making history alright, and not in a good way.
6 | William Johnson | 46 | 10154982523433812_10154982526768812 | Trump is surrounded by so many corrupt politicians who have lobbied in Washington DC. Yet he has convinced his followers that he is a change agent? What the hell is going on?
7 | Aneesah Yumn | 8 | 10154982523433812_10154982575978812 | The Presidential race has nothing to do with this guy being scum. These are high ranking employees of his! How can they pull all this together and he not know. The hear no evil and see no evil is very far fetch. Highly unlikely he will hold any political position in NJ. He better hope Trump wins, cause birds of a feather flock together. With Trump saying of course Chris had to know.
8 | Mary Lewis | 1 | 10154982523433812_10154982763708812 | That's what you get! It's sad that nearly every politician, both Republican and Democrat, are a bunch of crooks, skeezers and scandalous scoundrels üòë
9 | Olivia Triplett Wright | 5 | 10154982523433812_10154982567013812 | Some people are die hard Democrats, they don't care she let four of our guys get killed in a brutal way. They don't care she took millions of dollars from countries that chant "Death to America ", the same country, Saudi Arabia responsible for 3,000 ppl killed on 911. They don't care that Bill would be in the Whitehouse too, that he disgraced it by his many, many affairs in the Oval Office! They don't understand what will happen when we are a One World Order, a Socialist nation that will run every aspect of their lives with regulations and take more of their money. Free college? Who is paying for free college? Help blacks and Latino, she has had thirty years to do it, what makes you believe her. She has had too many scandals to list here, too many lies, and then there are all the FBI investigations, all this doesn't matter, just that she is a woman and she is Democrat.
10 | Mark Agar | 0 | 10154982523433812_10154982695378812 | This was too good. Had to copy and paste it.. Enjoy Dear Hollywood celebrities, You exist for my entertainment. Some of you are great eye candy. Some of you can deliver a line with such conviction that you bring tears to my eyes. Some of you can scare the crap out of me. Others make me laugh. But you all have one thing in common, you only have a place in my world to entertain me. That‚Äôs it. You make your living pretending to be someone else. Playing dress up like a 6 year old. You live in a make believe world in front of a camera. And often when you are away from one too. Your entire existence depends on my patronage. I‚Äôll crank the organ grinder; you dance. I don‚Äôt really care where you stand on issues. Honestly, your stance matters far less to me than that of my neighbor. You see, you aren‚Äôt real. I turn off my TV or shut down my computer and you cease to exist in my world. Once I am done with you, I can put you back in your little box until I want you to entertain me again. I don‚Äôt care that you don't like Mr.Trump. But I bet you looked cute saying it. Get back into your bubble. I‚Äôll let you know when I‚Äôm in the mood for something blue and shiny. And I'm also supposed to care that you will leave this great country if Trump becomes president? Ha. Please don't forget to close the door behind you. We'd like to reserve your seat for someone who loves this country and really wants to be here. Make me laugh, or cry. Scare me. But realize that the only words of yours that matter are scripted. I might agree with some of you from time to time, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. In my world, you exist solely for my entertainment. So, shut your pie hole and dance.

1 | Tim Hardwick | 37 | 10154982429888812_10154982476323812 | Thats why we have to vote Trump by a land slide to be over whelming any  fraud and it will be plain to see.Clinton is to corrupt and our government is just as bad. Clinton should have been indicted all ready along with a few other's.
2 | Mark Thomas Hastings | 16 | 10154982429888812_10154982490868812 | Lance Armstrong was a hero after winning the Tour de France multiple times.  That is, until people found out he cheated.  He went outside of the rules and his fall from heroic to cheater was swift.  Hillary should be judged the same way.  She received the questions prior to at least one or more debates (there aren't that many debates), she and her campaign planted violent protestors at Trump rallies, and fabricated things like a Russian connection later proved inaccurate.  In addition, she was exposed for corruption in many areas along the way.  How can Americans stand by her side?  She won't be my President, just as Lance is no longer our bicycle champ, due to all of this...no matter the outcome.  Winning without cheating is graceful and the opposite is disgraceful
3 | Andy Miller | 32 | 10154982429888812_10154982435823812 | Unfortunately, this is the destruction that Donald Trump has already caused, just with the power of his big mouth. Lord knows the damage he would cause America with the power of the presidency.

In the past, the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. But they do not own Trump.Most likely you are unaware of what Trump is telling people as the media does not report it. A person who speaks like this is not endeared to the oligarchs.Who are the oligarchs?    Wall Street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the Federal Reserve, a federal agency that put 5 banks ahead of millions of troubled American homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. In order to save the mega-banks‚Äô balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless.    The military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power.    The neoconservatives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China.    The US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs.    Agribusiness (Monsanto et.al.), corporations that poison the soil, the water, the oceans, and our food with their GMOs, herbicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, while killing the bees that pollinate the crops.    The extractive industries‚Äîenergy, mining, fracking, and timber‚Äîthat maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply.    The Israel Lobby that controls US Middle East policy and is committing genocide against the Palestinians just as the US committed genocide against native Americans. Israel is using the US to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in Israel‚Äôs way.What convinces me that the Oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes‚Äô reporting and the facts on the ground.According to the presstitutes, Hillary is so far ahead that there is no point in Trump supporters bothering to vote. Hillary has won the election before the vote. Hillary has been declared a 93% sure winner.I am yet to see one Hillary yard sign, but Trump signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Hillary‚Äôs public appearances are unattended but Trumps are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida:‚ÄúTrump has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Trump signs and stickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Trump when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages.‚ÄùI know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity.I also receive from readers similar reports from around the country.This is how the theft of the election is supposed to work: The media concentrated in a few corporate hands has gone all out to convince not only Americans but also the world, that Donald Trump is such an unacceptable candidate that he has lost the election before the vote.By controlling the explanation, when the election is stolen those who challenge the stolen election are without a foundation in the media. All media reports will say that it was a runaway victory for Hillary over the misogynist immigrant-hating Trump.And liberal, progressive opinion will be relieved and off guard as Hillary takes us into nuclear war.That the Oligarchy intends to steal the election from the American people is verified by the officially reported behavior of the voting machines in early voting in Texas. The NPR presstitutes have declared that Hillary is such a favorite that even Republican Texas is up for grabs in the election.If this is the case, why was it necessary for the voting machines to be programmed to change Trump votes to Hillary votes? Those voters who noted that they voted Trump but were recorded Hillary complained. The election officials, claiming a glitch (which only went one way), changed to paper ballots. But who will count them? No ‚Äúglitches‚Äù caused Hillary votes to go to Trump, only Trump votes to go to Hillary.The most brilliant movie of our time was The Matrix. This movie captured the life of Americans manipulated by a false reality, only in the real America there is insufficient awareness and no Neo, except possibly Donald Trump, to challenge the system. Americans of all stripes‚Äîacademics, scholars, journalists, Republicans, Democrats, right-wing, left-wing, US Representatives, US Senators, Presidents, corporate moguls and brainwashed Americans and foreigners‚Äîlive in a false reality.In the United States today a critical presidential election is in process in which not a single important issue is addressed by Hillary and the presstitutes. This is total failure. Democracy, once the hope of the world, has totally failed in the United States of America. Trump is correct. The American people must restore the accountability of government to the people.

I'm in that "backward" state, Alabama and we have not had problems like other states. We have had voter ID for years without any issues whatsoever.

9 | Rick Friedman | 1 | 10154982429888812_10154982727593812 | Conspiracy theories that undermine our democracy were incessantly repeated by Trump this year. People started to believe them, end as they were discredited by journalists, after the provocative, self-serving propaganda was broadcasted every day. Can we believe anything Trump says?  Does he now suddenly care about the little guy? Let's see what Kelly Anne Conway, his campaign manager, says: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cjPfljy0BzQday.

11 | Gary Doan | 15 | 10154982429888812_10154982431148812 | We have witnessed the largest, most elaborate political coverup in history. Obama's Department of Justice, the Mass Media, the DNC and Hillary Clinton have almost succeeded, by attacking Trump. Their defense, was to go on offense and they flooded the media, with claims of violence, even rape. The violence was found to be planned and instigated by paid Team Hillary goons, who even rehearsed before hand. Their offense was all staged and fake. It‚Äôs all fake, the fake rape lawsuit was even dropped the week before the election. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt, dishonest politician to ever run for office.

He is running against trade with all his business outsourced to Mexico, China and Bangladesh and his goods for his hotels imported from abroad; he is running against corruption and he is the first politician in modern time too corrupted to show his tax returns. He wants to make America great again, but hires his workers from overseas, does not pay taxes to support the country, and skipped serving in the military in the age when honorable men were enlisting. What's worse he praised Hillary as being a great First Lady and ready for the Presidency, yet wants us to now magically believe that she is unprepared - well we believe you the first time. Do you see anything wrong with this scenario? That is what in New York they call a CON my friends. VOTE!!!

Now, Clinton is putting the Cops and the System on Trial and hiding behind her lawyers - like a typical criminal would. And, you imbeciles are worried about what? Trump? That means, you're the controlled by the TV media. Which also means you have a pea-sized brain. Look, Wikileaks is not some Russian Hacker.

When a student in her class made fun of her older brother, who has autism, one 6-year-old couldn't stand idly by. Instead, she wrote a letter to the school, requesting that students learn about invisible disabilities.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mobarza Khan | 77 | 10154982363398812_10154982384103812 | Beautiful young girl with a great message. Children should need to understand understand and respect each other differences instead of making fun. I believe the worst disability is a "Human without compassion and empathy"
2 | Trish Guarnery Lueken | 16 | 10154982363398812_10154982400303812 | The letter has a great message, but I don't believe this was written by a child. Not saying the subject wasn't discussed by the family, but it looks like it was written by an adult, with typos thrown to make it appear like the sister wrote it. Just my opinion, which I am entitled to.
3 | Jazmin Lopez | 18 | 10154982363398812_10154982406108812 | My daughter who at the time was 4 and was attending a head start program was in a class with a students with special needs and students that didn't have special needs. My son, my daughters twin brother who has severe autism came with me to pick her up one day and the teacher told me "Now I see why Kristie(my daughter) is always looking out for Loui(student with autism)". The teacher was unaware my son had autism. She said "she is always looking out for him. How at such a young age she's aware without knowing his disability" üò¢ Thank you to this baby girl for sticking up for her brother üíô
4 | Sue Goyette | 11 | 10154982363398812_10154982386088812 | As a mother of a 13 year old on the spectrum- I also wish all students would learn too.  I try but sometimes the adults need to reinforce and believe it too.
5 | Nicole M Santiago | 0 | 10154982363398812_10154982806428812 | Ihave adisabilyty is ver y small but it still efects me my siblings that are years younger then me Im 22 my siblings are 13 and 11 understand when they ware little to treat kids like they do to me normal my siblings defended a boy with Autusum at school the teacher ask why they ware so mad they sead if we dont treat are big sis like that we are not stain shut im proud of my siblings that are very mature for their age ‚ò∫ the mother was so shock and my mom was so proud
6 | Julie Schomaker Divish | 0 | 10154982363398812_10154982680993812 | Now this is how a parent should raise their child. She may be young but she obviously was taught at a very young age to respectt all folks no matter what. How she said invisible disabilities, that was so adult, so kudos to this little girl for she is much older and wise beyond her yrs and to her folks, you have done one heck of an awesome job. Be proud. I pray that this school actually acknowledges this letter and sometthing is done.
7 | Maxine Van Tran | 1 | 10154982363398812_10154982728213812 | That is just finally something still good in this world . We need bullying education in this country because this is not cute ! It's sad for a child to learn what mean people do in her generation:((

9 | Paula Steele | 0 | 10154982363398812_10154982908723812 | So a six year old wrote this letter...hmm. I agree with the message, but really folks a six year old writing this seems just a little far fetched.

13 | Ashley Ryan | 8 | 10154982363398812_10154982462308812 | I have mild Asperger's and didn't know until I was in my 30s. I was smart, skipped two grades, and had to be told by my parents when I was 10 or 11 that looking people in the eye was expected. I can do that, but I force myself to do it, and I look away as soon as possible. People think I'm being dodgy, and some people used to think I was snobby or don't like them, but the only way I can explain my demeanor that I am not comfortable conveying my soul to another person through my gaze.It would have been nice if my parents or my teachers knew about and identified my Asperger's when I was young. Knowledge and education about it has liberated me, and I don't live with the stigma that I am just an antisocial person. I am, thankfully, lucid enough to talk openly about my Asperger's and I don't let it hinder me or others' perception of me anymore.It's not just other kids who need to understand autism, it's teachers, parents, and the person who is autistic!  Do not underestimate what your autistic child or student can understand and do.  They might not be able (or willing) to communicate like you do, but they can do and see things you cannot.  Researchers need to bridge autistic giftedness to the rest of society.
14 | Sarah Berry | 9 | 10154982363398812_10154982394858812 | I think the title meant to say "little sister defends her brother with autism after student called him 'weird'."

I often found the parents of these little ambassadors to be a bit less understanding of how parents advocated so passionately for their special needs children. My response was always to tell them to imagine spending a day in the skin of that parent and imagine what you would do. It was amazing how it made them stop, think and understand. This little girl is an awesome ambassador.

16 | Gene Smith | 0 | 10154982295178812_10154982696343812 | Who really cares about the sideshow: Hillary sending and receiving classified emails, using an illegal unsecure private server (which according to the FBI was breached by multiple foreign hackers) to send and receive classified email, deleting emails after congress issued a subpoena, lying to congress while under oath, intimating, bulling, discrediting and threatening women her husband sexually assaulted to keep them quiet, Clinton Foundation paying men more than women and stole the primary election from Bernie Sanders. Is Hillary & Bill Clinton the two you want your children to look up to? What is important is what will affect your life and the life of your children for decades to come. Hillary Clinton will do the following: she will nominate 1 to 3 LIBERAL Supreme Court judges, she will appoint 100+ LIBERAL federal judges, she would grant legal status and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants (50+% are on some kind of welfare now for their US born children & Medicaid. It will encourage additional illegal immigrants to come to the U.S.), she would allow more refugees from Syria and Iraq (on average, each Middle Eastern refugee resettled in the United States costs an estimated $64,370 in the first five years, or $257,481 per household of your tax dollars. They get welfare (cash welfare, food stamps, public housing and Medicaid) and education. If they don‚Äôt succeed, they will be on welfare, food stamps, in public housing and Medicaid forever), she would keep Obamacare (premiums increasing 25% to over 100% in some states), she would increase our national debt by increasing social programs (70+% of people on ObamaCare receive subsidies to pay for health care. Government paid health care, paid by tax payers. She wants to increase federal spending, in areas such as child care. Under her plan, every worker would be entitled to up to 12 weeks of paid family leave and an additional 12 weeks of paid medical leave. While on leave, the GOVERNMENT would pay these workers two-thirds of what they make on the job in order to replace their wages. She also wants to expand social security (it is already going to run out of money), she would increase taxes to pay for all the social programs (there is not enough upper class tax payers. Hillary considers anyone making over $250,000/family upper class which is 5% of those paying taxes. Middle class and people on FIXED INCOME better wise up), she would keep trade deals like TPP and TAFTA (benefits a few at the expense of the American workers), she would keep lopsided trade deals (will increase our trade deficit), she would keep the same crime and gun violence programs as under Obama except she would erode 2nd amendment rights, she wants open borders (how do you stop more illegal immigrants from entering the country plus stopping drugs and possible terrorist), she would allow companies and jobs to continue to leave the U.S. for Mexico and overseas, POLITICS will be business as usual (with the wealthy and the establishment running the show, not the people), Government will grow and become more intrusive in our life. Where will the money come from? Is this the change everyone wanted? These are the real issues that will affect you and your family for decades to come. This is what this election is all about. Nothing else matters! This was said during President Clinton‚Äôs impeachment trial by a Senator: ‚ÄúWe have reduced lying under oath to a breach of etiquette‚Äù. Nothing has changed for the Clinton‚Äôs. They both lied under oath and they both think it is not serious and think it is just a BREACH OF ETIQETTE. If this is what you want, that is great. If not, think before you vote!

The Democratic Party's fault lines have been overshadowed by the near civil war within the GOP. But Democrats will face their own divisions after Election Day, and the battle over the party's heart, soul and future may well play out on the floor of the Senate, under direction of a new Democratic leader, Senator Chuck Schumer.

1 | Jonie Miller | 45 | 10154982292633812_10154982304898812 | The evidence is overwhelming now against HRC .. they want a Grand Jury... the. DOJ ( Obama's DOJ) wont gather a grand jury no matter what the FBI says to do....Never in my life have I seen the cancer of politics grow so far into our national legal system....it is very, very disheartening.
2 | Derrick Davis | 37 | 10154982292633812_10154982298978812 | The democratic party is already in the midst of a civil war sunce the day they endorsed Clinton. The corporate media just refuses to report on it because they dont want the public to recognize it.
3 | Laura Brown | 5 | 10154982292633812_10154982425013812 | The Clintons represent the bottom of Washington Elitism and the inside corruption and personal greed. They benefit from the protection from the Democratic Party and its influence and the power of the liberal media. This enabling gives undue credit and the possibly of protection from criminal prosecution for this political dynasty. The election of Hillary Clinton with her past history and potential of indictment is the sad refection of our current political state. The solution is to vote for change, the outsider, builder...one who is capable of new ideas and energy, Donald Trump.
4 | Frank Collins | 14 | 10154982292633812_10154982335153812 | How can their not be division in the Democratic Party after overwhelming evidence proved that the DNC and Mainstream Media plotted against Bernie Sanders? If Bernie wasn't such a sell out coward then this would be more obvious.

I want Democrats that get in your face, fight & don't back down & are not more concerned with their jobs than with the people they were elected to serve!!  Democrats have always been fighters....What has happened?? It seems as though Hillary Clinton is the only fighter out there.....where are the rest of them???...

7 | Freda Larson | 18 | 10154982292633812_10154982296498812 | Now, I'm wondering if Schumer has visited the Child-Sex Island... Seems to me the ONLY reason someone would support HER is if SHE has something on THEM that's VERY BAD.
8 | Dan Terry | 1 | 10154982292633812_10154982437488812 | How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.  I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"By Bill Snow Jr.
9 | Lindsay Arnold Hadley | 4 | 10154982292633812_10154982339528812 | The democratic party has had millions that bailed out, holding their noses on a run for fresh air.  This leftist media will soon get the boot. They know it!
10 | Stefanie West | 0 | 10154982292633812_10154982482598812 | "Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?"
11 | Joseph Stephen | 1 | 10154982292633812_10154982426313812 | I am now convinced that the Oligarchy that rules America intends to steal the presidential election. In the past, the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. But they do not own Trump.Most likely you are unaware of what Trump is telling people as the media does not report it. A person who speaks like this is not endeared to the oligarchs.Who are the oligarchs?    Wall Street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the Federal Reserve, a federal agency that put 5 banks ahead of millions of troubled American homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. In order to save the mega-banks‚Äô balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless.    The military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power.    The neoconservatives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China.    The US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs.    Agribusiness (Monsanto et.al.), corporations that poison the soil, the water, the oceans, and our food with their GMOs, herbicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, while killing the bees that pollinate the crops.    The extractive industries‚Äîenergy, mining, fracking, and timber‚Äîthat maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply.    The Israel Lobby that controls US Middle East policy and is committing genocide against the Palestinians just as the US committed genocide against native Americans. Israel is using the US to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in Israel‚Äôs way.What convinces me that the Oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes‚Äô reporting and the facts on the ground.According to the presstitutes, Hillary is so far ahead that there is no point in Trump supporters bothering to vote. Hillary has won the election before the vote. Hillary has been declared a 93% sure winner.I am yet to see one Hillary yard sign, but Trump signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Hillary‚Äôs public appearances are unattended but Trumps are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida:‚ÄúTrump has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Trump signs and stickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Trump when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages.‚ÄùI know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity.I also receive from readers similar reports from around the country.This is how the theft of the election is supposed to work: The media concentrated in a few corporate hands has gone all out to convince not only Americans but also the world, that Donald Trump is such an unacceptable candidate that he has lost the election before the vote.By controlling the explanation, when the election is stolen those who challenge the stolen election are without a foundation in the media. All media reports will say that it was a runaway victory for Hillary over the misogynist immigrant-hating Trump.And liberal, progressive opinion will be relieved and off guard as Hillary takes us into nuclear war.That the Oligarchy intends to steal the election from the American people is verified by the officially reported behavior of the voting machines in early voting in Texas. The NPR presstitutes have declared that Hillary is such a favorite that even Republican Texas is up for grabs in the election.If this is the case, why was it necessary for the voting machines to be programmed to change Trump votes to Hillary votes? Those voters who noted that they voted Trump but were recorded Hillary complained. The election officials, claiming a glitch (which only went one way), changed to paper ballots. But who will count them? No ‚Äúglitches‚Äù caused Hillary votes to go to Trump, only Trump votes to go to Hillary.The most brilliant movie of our time was The Matrix. This movie captured the life of Americans manipulated by a false reality, only in the real America there is insufficient awareness and no Neo, except possibly Donald Trump, to challenge the system. Americans of all stripes‚Äîacademics, scholars, journalists, Republicans, Democrats, right-wing, left-wing, US Representatives, US Senators, Presidents, corporate moguls and brainwashed Americans and foreigners‚Äîlive in a false reality.In the United States today a critical presidential election is in process in which not a single important issue is addressed by Hillary and the presstitutes. This is total failure. Democracy, once the hope of the world, has totally failed in the United States of America. Trump is correct. The American people must restore the accountability of government to the people.
12 | Gary Doan | 11 | 10154982292633812_10154982293743812 | We have witnessed the largest, most elaborate political coverup in history. Obama's Department of Justice, the Mass Media, the DNC and Hillary Clinton have almost succeeded, by attacking Trump. Their defense, was to go on offense and they flooded the media, with claims of violence, even rape. The violence was found to be planned and instigated by paid Team Hillary goons, who even rehearsed before hand. Their offense was all staged and fake. It‚Äôs all fake, the fake rape lawsuit was even dropped the week before the election. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt, dishonest politician to ever run for office.

17 | Kevin McGuire | 4 | 10154982292633812_10154982315693812 | More reasons not to vote for Hillary. For every argument the media make against Trump, Hillary's worse. (1) Eleven years ago, Trump said on a secretly recorded tape that celebrities can do anything -- even grab a woman's p*ssy. Hillary, born-again Victorian virgin, campaigns with Beyonce, who performs a duet with the words "curvalicious, p*ssy served delicious.‚Äù Hillary is thrilled to have the support of Madonna -- who has publicly offered to give blow jobs to anyone who votes for Hillary. (She'll even remove her teeth!) Hillary's campaign has deployed Miley Cyrus to canvas for her -- when Cyrus is not busy inviting men in the audience to reach up and grab her p*ssy. (Video of delicate flower Miley Cyrus in action.) When Vernon Jordan was asked by CBS' Mike Wallace what he talked about while golfing with Bill Clinton -- aka Hillary's husband -- he answered: "P*ssy.‚Äù Oh, and 11 years before Teddy Kennedy ran for president as the Conscience of the Democratic Party -- he killed a girl. After grabbing her p*ssy. (2) Trump's a sexual predator! Hillary's husband is a well-established rapist, groper and pants-dropper. She's his fixer. Unlike the serial predations of her husband, leveled repeatedly throughout the decades, these 11th-hour allegations against Trump are highly suspect, for the timing alone. Recall that The New York Times spent months investigating Trump's treatment of women earlier this year. The Newspaper of Record put its best reporters on the job, interviewed a dozen women, and the paper splashed the story on its front page. But the best the Times could come up with was a story about Trump, as a bachelor, publicly praising a model for looking great in a bikini at his pool party. Then they dated. The horror.Ann Coulter

This woman open up America to all manner of attacks, look at this five or more different countries have stolen America secrets because of Hillary Clinton greed, this was no mistake on her part. This is a pattern with the Clintons, this has been happening ever since Bill Clinton was a governor of Arkansas nothing has change with these two no matter how much money they have. If Hillary and Bill Clinton can steel money from a poor people in Haiti, what won't they do to us. America we are smart people please think about our country, Hillary Clinton is going to destroy us, please I am begging you think long and hard before you vote. Protecting our country does not make us racist, the word is just being used to distract us from the real issues facing us.A country with out borders is not a country at all, please think about this one. If someone shows you that they are irresponsible, untrustworthy, unreliable, not responsible and not dependable you should take heed. From my observation over this year Hillary has been operating like a communist leader, I don't want the government control every aspect of my life do you?

He vowed an unfeasible dreams to the American people.So, if he would be 45th president, he'll discourage all American people in first 4 years or less than shorter.I feel that He will betraying the light of hope of middle class, youths, and other people who are fed up with the status quo.I do not want to see the disappointment of all American people who betrayed by Donald Trump in his first term....Kai.„Åü„Åè„ÄÇ
3 | Joseph Stephen | 2 | 10154982176883812_10154982426563812 | I am now convinced that the Oligarchy that rules America intends to steal the presidential election. In the past, the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. But they do not own Trump.Most likely you are unaware of what Trump is telling people as the media does not report it. A person who speaks like this is not endeared to the oligarchs.Who are the oligarchs?    Wall Street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the Federal Reserve, a federal agency that put 5 banks ahead of millions of troubled American homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. In order to save the mega-banks‚Äô balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless.    The military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power.    The neoconservatives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China.    The US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs.    Agribusiness (Monsanto et.al.), corporations that poison the soil, the water, the oceans, and our food with their GMOs, herbicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, while killing the bees that pollinate the crops.    The extractive industries‚Äîenergy, mining, fracking, and timber‚Äîthat maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply.    The Israel Lobby that controls US Middle East policy and is committing genocide against the Palestinians just as the US committed genocide against native Americans. Israel is using the US to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in Israel‚Äôs way.What convinces me that the Oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes‚Äô reporting and the facts on the ground.According to the presstitutes, Hillary is so far ahead that there is no point in Trump supporters bothering to vote. Hillary has won the election before the vote. Hillary has been declared a 93% sure winner.I am yet to see one Hillary yard sign, but Trump signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Hillary‚Äôs public appearances are unattended but Trumps are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida:‚ÄúTrump has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Trump signs and stickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Trump when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages.‚ÄùI know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity.I also receive from readers similar reports from around the country.This is how the theft of the election is supposed to work: The media concentrated in a few corporate hands has gone all out to convince not only Americans but also the world, that Donald Trump is such an unacceptable candidate that he has lost the election before the vote.By controlling the explanation, when the election is stolen those who challenge the stolen election are without a foundation in the media. All media reports will say that it was a runaway victory for Hillary over the misogynist immigrant-hating Trump.And liberal, progressive opinion will be relieved and off guard as Hillary takes us into nuclear war.That the Oligarchy intends to steal the election from the American people is verified by the officially reported behavior of the voting machines in early voting in Texas. The NPR presstitutes have declared that Hillary is such a favorite that even Republican Texas is up for grabs in the election.If this is the case, why was it necessary for the voting machines to be programmed to change Trump votes to Hillary votes? Those voters who noted that they voted Trump but were recorded Hillary complained. The election officials, claiming a glitch (which only went one way), changed to paper ballots. But who will count them? No ‚Äúglitches‚Äù caused Hillary votes to go to Trump, only Trump votes to go to Hillary.The most brilliant movie of our time was The Matrix. This movie captured the life of Americans manipulated by a false reality, only in the real America there is insufficient awareness and no Neo, except possibly Donald Trump, to challenge the system. Americans of all stripes‚Äîacademics, scholars, journalists, Republicans, Democrats, right-wing, left-wing, US Representatives, US Senators, Presidents, corporate moguls and brainwashed Americans and foreigners‚Äîlive in a false reality.In the United States today a critical presidential election is in process in which not a single important issue is addressed by Hillary and the presstitutes. This is total failure. Democracy, once the hope of the world, has totally failed in the United States of America. Trump is correct. The American people must restore the accountability of government to the people.

This whole organization will be indicted and charged with RICO violations, the likes of which we have never seen before. It will run deep and will include many people we didn't even know were part of this, the more reason, "not" to vote for Hillary.

9 | Gary Doan | 39 | 10154982090558812_10154982099503812 | We have witnessed the largest, most elaborate political coverup in history. Obama's Department of Justice, the Mass Media, the DNC and Hillary Clinton have almost succeeded, by attacking Trump. Their defense, was to go on offense and they flooded the media, with claims of violence, even rape. The violence was found to be planned and instigated by paid Team Hillary goons, who even rehearsed before hand. Their offense was all staged and fake. It‚Äôs all fake, the fake rape lawsuit was even dropped the week before the election. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt, dishonest politician to ever run for office.

If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.  I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection.

Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection.

They WANT to believe that this man is good and has their interests at heart. Many of them are legitimately upset about how their lives have turned out. But at some point, even lack of education can not be used as an excuse for supporting someone who continues to defy polity, decency, and dignity; not to mention his nationalistic (to put it mildly) tendencies and his insensitivity to those that were not born with a trust fund, a Y chromosome, white parents, and no inherited challenges of their own.
16 | Shawn Davis | 2 | 10154982014888812_10154982276093812 | He's always talking about violence. Last election he told Blacks that Romney would put them back in chains. Seems like Biden is a violent guy geez.

Maybe it's because everyone of those in office are jackasses......which just goes to show those who voted for them......
25 | Shannon Vogt | 0 | 10154982014888812_10154982759783812 | You might as well give it up about the language because Hillary is campaigning with musicians that have some of the worst language out there not to mention how they promote discriminating woman with the mucic they sing, and clothes they wear. And Hillary is standing behind them and having them campaign for her so obviously she don't have a problem with it.

Many expect a drop in black voter participation this year, primarily because Barack Obama, the nation's first African-American president, is not on the ballot. His historic candidacy in 2008 and re-election in 2012 helped to fuel record black turnout.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Fred Taylor | 51 | 10154981951758812_10154982014833812 | Correct me if I'm wrong but i thought dumbama was racially mixed. So why is he considered african American. Seems to me the mixed races are being discriminated against. He is the first mixed pres. Either way he sucks.
2 | Marilyn Aleem | 63 | 10154981951758812_10154981990913812 | I didn't vote for President Obama because he was black. I voted for him both times because he was the best candidate at the time. Heck, I really didn't care for him in 2008 until my teenage daughter told me his background. This doesn't mean that I will vote for Clinton. I'm still on the fence with this one and I certainly am not going to vote for Trump. Long story short, stop underestimating black people and how we think. We are way more intelligent than that.
3 | Joann Williber | 16 | 10154981951758812_10154982061578812 | If Obama worked as hard for our Country as he has trying to Protect and Elect Hilary-we would be much better off- He should be trying to fix Obama Care-
4 | Damonique Wright | 4 | 10154981951758812_10154982648493812 | I hate that people always think pastors can convince black people because someone of us have been so brainwashed by the church. The pastor is just a man and neither Hilary nor Trump can do anything for black people. Obama was black and didn't do much for us or his hometown (Chicago) ...stop looking for presidents to save us. Save yourself and your kids.
5 | Jaxson Froese | 39 | 10154981951758812_10154981953073812 | Obama's promise of unification was just another of his thousands of lies. He is extremely divisive, setting those without against those with, continually misrepresenting the facts and outright lying to further his cause of destroying America. The sooner he leaves office, the sooner we can start to rebuild what he torn down.Obama is the biggest threat to America there is‚Ä¶ He hates Americans, the Constitution, and free market capitalism. He destroyed our economy with measures like the ACA and immigration amnesty. The ‚ÄúAffordable‚Äù Care Act has been nothing short of a disaster. My health insurance bill is up to $450/month. (Compare this to my $25/month auto insurance from Insurance Panda or my $10/month renters insurance‚Ä¶ both private enterprise!) And he is anti-police!Yep, quite a legacy Obama is going to leave - he and his administration have set records for mass shootings, terrorist attacks, race riots, sending, scandals, school unrests and has even legitimized Anti-White Racism.
6 | Belinda Brown | 2 | 10154981951758812_10154982524648812 | People assume that humans, that live in the U.S., that are black, don't care to vote for their country? For their children? For themselves...because the nominees aren't black? I do not believe that, if they turned out in the numbers they did it probably because Obama actually gave a crap about America, about ALL Americans.
7 | John Chiv | 4 | 10154981951758812_10154982368733812 | Yes, black clergy please tell your voters to vote for an immoral, corrupt woman who just needs their votes but does not give a damn how they have lived for 30 years.

She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.

Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.

Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.

9 | David Halahmy | 9 | 10154981951758812_10154981984223812 | In just a few days our nation will take a another step back. Regardless of who is our next president. We have endured 8 years of rising debt (from 10 -20 trillion), growing Islamic radicalism, massive increases to our heath care and sadly a more divided nation then I have ever seen in my life. And neither of the two folks who will be sitting in the white house will do much about those issues. But I still have hope that one day our nation will find its path again. Neither Hilary or Trump will make your life better. That is up to you. I suggest a heavy dose of individual responsibility for the next stage of American History. If you work hard, be a good husband, wife, neighbor you will hopefully stay on your feet. It will be a historic day, we will elect a reality t.v. star celebrity to be president, or a person under FBI investigation who should be indicted. I pray one day our nation will find its exceptionalism again. And no one should look at either of these people as a "role model"
10 | Shedrick Ford Jr | 0 | 10154981951758812_10154982608848812 | You have a group of black folks that strongly believe it does not matter who the president is just as long as it does not affect their livelihood they could care less who's the president of the United States
11 | David Sammy Jr. | 4 | 10154981951758812_10154982017293812 | It's fact that the Black community as been duped and neglected by every President and at this point they had enough so they are very hesitant to cast their vote in this election for any particular canidate.. And Trump is trying to pull of the biggest political con job that were ever perpetrated on the citizens of America..
12 | Cordella Lyon | 1 | 10154981951758812_10154982280068812 | What's in it for you? The black clergy supports politicians in Washington, but they do not support their parishioners who are dying of AIDS. Charity begins at home. If you cannot address, love and care for your parishioners, but you will lobby for politicians then you are using your pulpit for personal gain.

In the medical field, I have a granddaughter that is half white and half black and that is what the doctors call her.So don't call him our first black president, when the mother is black and the father is black then you can call them black.

On the last day of early voting in Nevada, a line of people snaked through Cardenas Markets, Inc. and out into the parking lot of the Latin American grocery store chain in Las Vegas as polling hours were extended to accommodate the massive turnout. The big turnout from communities with large Latino populations could bode well for Hillary Clinton.

1 | Mike Garcia | 412 | 10154981886518812_10154981937828812 | It was the Latino vote. Trump has insulted the American Hispanics. We will not forget. The Republicans remember all the shenanigans ya'll are pulling. We won't forget it.

Have they helped you and your family? Have they listened to you? Just think before you vote and think about who has told you the truth about everything and think about whose lied to you and who's tried to corrupt our governmental politicians to lie to our people and to lie about situations about others that has never happened . Then ask yourself one last question. Now who can You trust? The people that corrupt our government or outsiders that don't have hidden agendas against our country!

I love all our nationalities. It's about becoming one again, not living with the corruption our government has created to empower them more than the people they serve. Don't divide us by thought!

19 | Hayley DeeAnn Vaughn Johnson | 25 | 10154981886518812_10154981894923812 | Trump is guilty of mocking a disabled man, admitting to sexual assault, his admiration of Putin, not paying taxes, underhanded business dealings, refusing to pay contractors who have worked for him, saying POW's aren't heroes because they got caught, (completely disregarding the hell these men went through in prison camps), insulting the parents of a soldier killed in action, calling women fat and ugly etc.. he has even mocked women for having periods.And I am supposed to care about emails and bogus Benghazi accusations? She didn't cut security funding, the GOP DID. By the way, Fox News is now apologizing for spread misinformation about Hillary's investigation and being indicted.. If she was guilty she would already be in jail. Michael Vick was guilty of animal abuse and dog fighting, and despite his millions of dollars he still did his time. Stop making excuses, I get you're all desperate for who you believe is better and guilty of less but claiming that person is Trump is nonsense.
20 | Peter Geedman | 16 | 10154981886518812_10154981919533812 | How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.  I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"By Bill Snow Jr.

Many arrested, and who knows what else. Things are happening there that we are not being told about.  Now ABC is going to report on because of the benefit concert. Is this what it takes?

This whole protest is brought to you via globalist and climate change activists. Funded by special interest groups. Pipelines are the safest they have ever been. Pipelines that have been buried forty years ago are due for replacement.  Today's technology provides much more efficient and safer pipelines.  And oil in its natural state is exactly that. All natural. Totally harmless.  It's when it's refined into fuels and chemicals. Now that's a far worse disaster. And these fuels and chemicals roll through communities daily via rail. You idiots need to do some research.  Rock/movie stars stick to what you know. And stay away from what you don't know.

House Democrats are on track to bolster their numbers in Tuesday's election, perhaps picking off veteran Republicans from New Jersey, Florida and California along the way. But with no visible wave poised to engulf Republicans, there's little suspense about whether the GOP will keep control.

1 | Jacqueline Young | 27 | 10154981755708812_10154981785628812 | I would be so happy if Dems can flip the Senate. The Republican Senators act so unAmerican and are not doing their job and have threatened to not do it again if Hillary Clinton wins. The repubs think the Supreme Court is a joke and that their rulings don't matter. The Senate has lost all credibility with me. Dems should go for it and win it back and vow to do a better job, starting with giving Supreme Ct nominees a fair chance.

3 | Shannon Asbell | 4 | 10154981755708812_10154981840103812 | I think it is time for the Republican to no longer exist. They do nothing, except spread hate. Let the Independents step up into their place. And, before you call me a name, I am not a democrat either. I just can't stand the Republicans way of thinking. This is about America, all Americans not just the elite. Vote Blue. Stand up and make a change. Tell the Republicans that we don't think that way and we need a change.

5 | Peter Geedman | 5 | 10154981755708812_10154981821178812 | How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.  I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"By Bill Snow Jr.

7 | Alyssa Zapora Ehl | 49 | 10154981587343812_10154981597853812 | *Here is something to think about**, and why so many Americans supportDonald Trump !!*(This information has all been checked, then double checked... it is 100%Correct.)That's why there is such an alarm within US government, since Trump'sstatement about temporary suspension of migration of Muslims to US till USauthorities make sure there is a proper concept of safe penetration of USterritory.People are stunned to learn that the head of the U.S. CIA is a Muslim!Do hope this wakes up some!You mean until it hits you like a ton of bricks read it again, until youunderstand!We now have a Muslim government.John Brennan, current head of the CIA converted to Islam while stationed inSaudi Arabia.Obama's top adviser, Valerie Jarrett, is a Muslim who was born in Iranwhere her parents still live.Hillary Clinton's top adviser, Huma Abedin is a Muslim, whose mother andbrother are involved in the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.Assistant Secretary for Policy Development for Homeland Security, ArifAikhan, is a Muslim.Homeland Security Adviser, Mohammed Elibiary, is a Muslim.Obama adviser and founder of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, Salamal-Marayati, is a Muslim.Obama's Sharia Czar, Imam Mohamed Magid, of the Islamic Society of NorthAmerica is a Muslim..Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships, Eboo Patel, is aMuslim.1/13/15:?? Nancy Pelosi announced she will appoint Rep Andre Carson, D-Ind,as the first Muslim lawmaker on the House of Representatives PermanentSelect Committee on Intelligence. It would make Carson the first Muslim toserve on the committee that receives intelligence on the threat of Islamicmilitants in the Middle East! He has suggestedthat U.S. schools should be modeled after Islamic madrassas, whereeducation is based on the Quran!!!And last but not least, our closet Muslim himself, Barack Hussein Obama.It's questionable if Obama ever officially took the oath of office when hewas sworn in. He didn't repeat the oath properly to defend ournation andour Constitution. Later the Democrats claimed he was given the oath againin private.CIA director John Brennan took his oath on a copy of the Constitution, nota Bible..??Valarie Jarret wrote her college thesis on how she wanted to change Americainto a Muslim friendly nation and she is a Obama top advisor.Congressman, Keith Ellison took his oath on a copy of the Qur'an.Congresswoman Michele Bachman was vilified and verbally tarred andfeathered by Democrats when she voiced her concern about Muslims takingover our government.Considering all these appointments, it would explain why Obama and hisminions are systematically destroying our nation, supporting radical Muslimgroups worldwide, opening our southern border, and turning a blind eye tothe genocide being perpetrated on Christians all over Africa and the MiddleEast.The more damage Obama does, the more arrogant he's become!Our nation and our government has been infiltrated by people who want todestroy us. It can only get worse!If you fail to pass this one on, there's something wrong.. Somewhere!In his book he said, "if it comes down to it, I would side with theMuslims". (And still, some insist he isn‚Äôt Muslim!)Common sense doesn't grow in everyone's garden.
8 | Tristan Tris | 25 | 10154981587343812_10154981765613812 | I can't believe Hilary is getting away from her email scandal. She put the the entire country at risk. If she can get away with Benghazi and her illegal emails what more will be done when she is elected. The only reason why she will win is because this election is purely racially motivated and she is using it for her advantage. Did I mention she use Jay-Z to get younger voters SMH.
9 | Bunny Benson | 14 | 10154981587343812_10154981712568812 | While I‚Äôve opposed the Trump candidacy from the start, I‚Äôve never disparaged Trump voters. Some are friends and neighbors; they‚Äôre all fellow Americans. We should take their concerns seriously. But we should also demand that they be serious, that they draw distinctions between these two presidential candidates. Yes, Hillary Clinton is a flawed leader ‚Äî but in the way so many presidents were. We know her flaws: She has a weakness for secrecy, occasionally fudges truths, has fawning aides and a husband who lacks discipline when it comes to moneymaking and women. But she is not indecent, and that is an important distinction. And she‚Äôs studious, has sought out people of substance on every issue and has taken the job of running for president seriously.Trump is not only a flawed politician, he‚Äôs an indecent human being. He‚Äôs boasted of assaulting women ‚Äî prompting 11 to come forward to testify that he did just that to them; his defense is that he could not have assaulted these women because they weren‚Äôt pretty enough.He‚Äôs created a university that was charged with defrauding its students. He‚Äôs been charged with discriminating against racial minorities in his rental properties. He‚Äôs stiffed countless vendors, from piano sellers to major contractors. He‚Äôs refused to disclose his tax returns because they likely reveal that he‚Äôs paid no federal taxes for years, is in bed with dodgy financiers and doesn‚Äôt give like he says to charity.He‚Äôs compared the sacrifice of parents of a soldier killed in Iraq to his ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù of building tall buildings. He‚Äôs vowed, if elected, to prosecute his campaign rival.At the same time, Trump has shown no ability to talk about any policy issue with any depth. Harlan Coben‚Äôs debate-night tweet last month had it right: ‚ÄúOn Aleppo he sounds like a fifth grader giving a book report on a book he never read.‚Äù                    Trump wants to make America great in ways that are just not available anymore. ‚ÄúWhat do we have to lose‚Äù by trying his way? Trump asks. The answer is: everything that actually makes us great. When the world gets this fast, small errors in navigation have huge consequences.While Clinton has failed to inspire, her instincts and ideas will keep us hewing to basically the right course. And however great her flaws, she is still in the zone of human decency. Trump is not.We can never be great as a country with a president with the warped values of Donald Trump. I pray that in the end at least some Trump voters, my fellow Americans, will see that. New York Times
10 | Patrick OConnell | 32 | 10154981587343812_10154981749713812 | I'll vote for the candidate not under criminal investigation by the FBI. A businessman who knows how to Make America Great again!! Trump for all the people!

15 | Shawn Williams | 10 | 10154981587343812_10154981780053812 | We need a president who will bring back jobs. We need a president who will put Americans first. We need a president who can clean the scandals and all the evil out of the system. We need a president who believes in peace. We need a president who will protect our rights. We need a president who will not keep the man down and will give us equal opportunities to make a better life. We need a president who will go after the medical corporates making health care unaffordable. We need a president who will stop letting congress take money just to pass bills. We need a president who will stop the government from taking away out rights. But the president is no where to be found. It's a sad day to be a American we go to other countries start war for profit we bomb other countries for profit.
16 | Jim Roskowsky | 5 | 10154981587343812_1791171444504372 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.PLEASE SHARE !!
17 | Dan Terry | 1 | 10154981587343812_1612872459009508 | Thought I should shareHow quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.  I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"By Bill Snow Jr.

Her aides are calling it "the Hillary coalition," rather than "the Obama coalition," distinguished by her dependence on an apparent surge of Hispanic voters, while Pres. Barack Obama set records for African-American turnout. But the foundations remain the same: nonwhite voters, millennials and women. Even some Republicans acknowledge that still gives Hillary Clinton an advantage over Donald J. Trump in an increasingly diverse country.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Liberty Never Sleeps | 50 | 10154981574373812_10154981575133812 | Liberals and socialists always talk about giving some ethnic group preference, or redistributing the wealth. What about Christians? Or the Irish? Or Blacks? Or any ethnic group for that matter. Do we base our hiring and wealth on these factors or on the requirements of the job and who is best suited to do them. I'm tired of these politics of division in which no one wins. I want someone who is running for President to talk about all of America as equals; about all Americans instead of this special interest group or that one. What is good for Irishman is good for the African American folks. Clinton is always talking about a dark, depressing, vision for America that Trump has. What about her own, where women and minorities are too dumb, weak and lazy to do things on their own and without government intervention?That's not the America I know.
2 | Kevin Lawley | 17 | 10154981574373812_10154982222858812 | She is suppose to be so great. She can't win anything without cheating or on her merit. Sad part for America we gave all these people  lieing for her. She will do nothing to better our lives. The claim is Trump is rude but no one has said he's failed building his business. Hillary has spent others money. Trump has spent his own.

The coalition has already been broken, the only thing Hillary can rely on now is fear of Trump. It might be enough, but Hillary will get no where near Obama's record number of votes and the election will be allot closer than everyone predicted earlier.

It is an ignorant way to make such an important decision. It doesn't reveal faith in the candidate, it reveals a high level of stupidity
9 | Mark Bray | 7 | 10154981574373812_10154981593923812 | What disgusts me about Trump and his positions is not that I haven't read or listened to them; I have. What disgusts me is that he is anti-Constitution in his desperation to throw groups of people who are not the majority away in the scrap heap in order to gain power (violates Father of the Constitution James Madison Federalist Number 10 who said no tyranny of the majority). He also uses simplistic explanations of complex issues that simply do not work and are red herrings to help propel him to power--he says build a wall--no wall in the history of humanity has worked--ask the people who built the Great Wall or the Maginot Line Wall and all the others. He says have Mexico pay for it. How and why? Use trade surplus money--that is not money of the Mexican Government but corporations and people--so he is advocating appropriating private property which is against the "life, liberty and pursuit of property (happiness) key fundamentals of the American Journey. He says to undo trade agreements but the reality is that they help our Economy more than they hurt us and Nobel Laureates agree--or if you don't believe in experts let a high school student be a general commanding troops then or a Biology student in anatomy do your open heart surgery. I can go on and on--and the Trump positions would not help America or the World, and they will hurt the people who support him more than they would possibly help, and therefore he is a net negative on the American and global equation and needs to be sent on his way to the hinterlands where he belongs.
10 | Alyssa Zapora Ehl | 5 | 10154981574373812_10154981596653812 | *Here is something to think about**, and why so many Americans supportDonald Trump !!*(This information has all been checked, then double checked... it is 100%Correct.)That's why there is such an alarm within US government, since Trump'sstatement about temporary suspension of migration of Muslims to US till USauthorities make sure there is a proper concept of safe penetration of USterritory.People are stunned to learn that the head of the U.S. CIA is a Muslim!Do hope this wakes up some!You mean until it hits you like a ton of bricks read it again, until youunderstand!We now have a Muslim government.John Brennan, current head of the CIA converted to Islam while stationed inSaudi Arabia.Obama's top adviser, Valerie Jarrett, is a Muslim who was born in Iranwhere her parents still live.Hillary Clinton's top adviser, Huma Abedin is a Muslim, whose mother andbrother are involved in the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.Assistant Secretary for Policy Development for Homeland Security, ArifAikhan, is a Muslim.Homeland Security Adviser, Mohammed Elibiary, is a Muslim.Obama adviser and founder of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, Salamal-Marayati, is a Muslim.Obama's Sharia Czar, Imam Mohamed Magid, of the Islamic Society of NorthAmerica is a Muslim..Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships, Eboo Patel, is aMuslim.1/13/15:?? Nancy Pelosi announced she will appoint Rep Andre Carson, D-Ind,as the first Muslim lawmaker on the House of Representatives PermanentSelect Committee on Intelligence. It would make Carson the first Muslim toserve on the committee that receives intelligence on the threat of Islamicmilitants in the Middle East! He has suggestedthat U.S. schools should be modeled after Islamic madrassas, whereeducation is based on the Quran!!!And last but not least, our closet Muslim himself, Barack Hussein Obama.It's questionable if Obama ever officially took the oath of office when hewas sworn in. He didn't repeat the oath properly to defend ournation andour Constitution. Later the Democrats claimed he was given the oath againin private.CIA director John Brennan took his oath on a copy of the Constitution, nota Bible..??Valarie Jarret wrote her college thesis on how she wanted to change Americainto a Muslim friendly nation and she is a Obama top advisor.Congressman, Keith Ellison took his oath on a copy of the Qur'an.Congresswoman Michele Bachman was vilified and verbally tarred andfeathered by Democrats when she voiced her concern about Muslims takingover our government.Considering all these appointments, it would explain why Obama and hisminions are systematically destroying our nation, supporting radical Muslimgroups worldwide, opening our southern border, and turning a blind eye tothe genocide being perpetrated on Christians all over Africa and the MiddleEast.The more damage Obama does, the more arrogant he's become!Our nation and our government has been infiltrated by people who want todestroy us. It can only get worse!If you fail to pass this one on, there's something wrong.. Somewhere!In his book he said, "if it comes down to it, I would side with theMuslims". (And still, some insist he isn‚Äôt Muslim!)Common sense doesn't grow in everyone's garden.

2 | Gary Doan | 92 | 10154981511073812_10154981515848812 | We have witnessed the largest, most elaborate political coverup in history. Obama's Department of Justice, the Mass Media, the DNC and Hillary Clinton have almost succeeded, by attacking Trump. Their defense, was to go on offense and they flooded the media, with claims of violence, even rape. The violence was found to be planned and instigated by paid Team Hillary goons, who even rehearsed before hand. Their offense was all staged and fake. It‚Äôs all fake, the fake rape lawsuit was even dropped the week before the election. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt, dishonest politician to ever run for office.
3 | Mike Hutchisson | 65 | 10154981511073812_10154981519548812 | Barack Obama has bought this country back from the worst recession since the Great Depression.

8 | Peter Geedman | 14 | 10154981511073812_10154981754023812 | How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.  I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"By Bill Snow Jr.

15 | Kelly Duffy Sage | 5 | 10154981511073812_10154981917003812 | Obama spent 9 TRILLION dollars for this anemic recovery, 9 Trillion without rebuilding our infrastructure, without taking care of our American Hero's, while depleting our military, destroying our decent health care, to make way for single payer, socialized medicine, while lying to us about it, our first african american president left his brothers and sisters to suffer in the inner cities without relief, and with the help of Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, created Chaos and death in the middle east, in Libya, in Syria, and allowed ISIS to rise in Iraq, the death toll is in the hundreds of thousands, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, and they call it a success.The United states is closer to war with Russia than we have been since the cold war, the Philippines, our protectorate and friend for generations has cut ties with us and is looking to join with china and russia, north Korea is launching medium range ballistic missiles into the south china sea, China has stolen our stealth technology and is using it to build their war machines, That is just the tip of the iceberg, we wont find out in truth, for decades, how much damage they have done, to this great nation.It is time for a change, Go Trump.
16 | Liberty Never Sleeps | 5 | 10154981511073812_10154981552613812 | Liberals always talk about giving some ethnic group preference. What about Christians? Or the Irish? Or Blacks? Or any ethnic group for that matter. Do we based hiring on these factors or on the requirements of the job and who is best suited to do them. I'm tired of these politics of division in which no one wins. I want someone who is running for President to talk about all of America as equals; about all Americans instead of this special interest group or that one. What is good for Irishman is good for the African American folks. Clinton is always talking about a dark, depressing, vision for America that Trump has. What about her own, where women and minorities are too dumb, weak and lazy to do things on their own and without government intervention?That's not the America I know.

You little stupid-a** b***h, I ain't f**kin' with you.'Violence against Police is up under the Racist Obama Administration. Obama‚Äôs Race and class wars have blacks killing police. We see police killings and mass civil disobedience for calling out the tactics of BlackLivesMatter and liberals attacking whites and the values of this country.

Finding out the truth about who was responsible for the death of our heroes who died in BENGHAZI.. We should not give up till we get justice for Chris Steven, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.. You want to vote for Hillary Clinton, the evil, crooked and wicked woman whose hands are stained with the blood of 4 our Heroes? She stood in front of these HEROES coffins, telling lies... Shame on her and on all those who vote for her.. The blood of the 4 heroes are on Hillary's hands and all those who vote for this evil woman.. When I say to the wicked, 'You wicked person, you will surely die,' and you do not speak out to dissuade them from their ways, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.

4 | LeRoi Mora | 37 | 10154981477958812_10154981484748812 | According to Hillary Clinton, average Americans under investigation by the FBI shouldn't be allowed to buy guns but corrupt politicians investigated by the FBI should be able to run for president and have access to the nuclear codes#LiberalLogic
5 | Sandy Machell | 11 | 10154981477958812_10154981485703812 | Yeah just take a look at the Hillary campaign,go on to shady pines with Dengy Harry!!!! You guys didn't have anything good to say about her four years ago!!!

7 | Jim Roskowsky | 0 | 10154981477958812_10154981940498812 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.PLEASE SHARE !!

10 | Tammy Davis | 1 | 10154981477958812_10154982188538812 | I still can not believe Hillary is running for president when she used an insecure server that had classified information on it. Emails went to so many people who did not have security clearance. plus they were hacked. All for her convenience! :(
11 | Peter Geedman | 4 | 10154981477958812_10154981772378812 | How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.  I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"By Bill Snow Jr.

24 | Mark Bray | 4 | 10154981477958812_10154981516698812 | What disgusts me about Trump and his positions is not that I haven't read or listened to them; I have. What disgusts me is that he is anti-Constitution in his desperation to throw groups of people who are not the majority away in the scrap heap in order to gain power (violates Father of the Constitution James Madison Federalist Number 10 who said no tyranny of the majority). He also uses simplistic explanations of complex issues that simply do not work and are red herrings to help propel him to power--he says build a wall--no wall in the history of humanity has worked--ask the people who built the Great Wall or the Maginot Line Wall and all the others. He says have Mexico pay for it. How and why? Use trade surplus money--that is not money of the Mexican Government but corporations and people--so he is advocating appropriating private property which is against the "life, liberty and pursuit of property (happiness) key fundamentals of the American Journey. He says to undo trade agreements but the reality is that they help our Economy more than they hurt us and Nobel Laureates agree--or if you don't believe in experts let a high school student be a general commanding troops then or a Biology student in anatomy do your open heart surgery. I can go on and on--and the Trump positions would not help America or the World, and they will hurt the people who support him more than they would possibly help, and therefore he is a net negative on the American and global equation and needs to be sent on his way to the hinterlands where he belongs.
25 | Johnny N Cher Buchanan | 0 | 10154981477958812_10154981702568812 | So Trump is for America and loves the people, yet he hates Mexicans. His wife is an immigrant, yet he wants to put up a wall. He discriminates against blacks living in his townhouses because he says their lazy. He wants to bring back jobs. Yet he won't pay his workers, his metal for his buildings come from China. He's a great business man, yet he has gone bankrupt many times. He doesn't want to show his taxes or pay taxes. Yet he's for America?? We talk of Hillary's E-mails yet they have found nothing to convict her. Bush deleted thousands of emails not a word was said. Bush admitted to lying about weapons of mass destruction, killing thousands. I hear people say Hillary kills babies. Is she performing the abortions? People need to wake up. Trump is for Trump. Don't be so dumb to this all. How can anyone believe in him? Please explain? I know many of you have children with disabilities. It's ok with you to that he makes fun of them? Your ok with him talking about woman's p****??? Please someone explain to me. Don't vote for Trump just because he's Republican. This is a game to him. A spoiled kid that will win the game even if he has to cheat because he's always had his way. Angie Cortese Sheila Saxton Harper
