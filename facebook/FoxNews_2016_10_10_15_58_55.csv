18 | Theresa Brooks | Lock her up. Never forget Benghazi. Never forget what is going on with Iran. Rebels supported by Iran fired missiles at our ship yesterday. You can get much lower than getting Americans killed.
19 | Kimberly D Spencer-Nearn | Clinton your political days are over! You went too far with the American voters! I can not support you! Wikileaks disclosed more than corruption they uncovered you are dangerous!

Donald J. Trump hit back on Twitter after House Speaker Paul Ryan said he would not campaign with the GOP presidential nominee. http://bit.ly/2d7Tt0R
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Shawn House | In 3 days, the media has covered Trump's 'sex talk' tape more than they have covered ALL of Bill Clinton's rape victims over the last 20 years combined, and no RINO's have called for her to step down....Let that sink in.
2 | Tess Taylor | "Actions speak louder than words. Mr. Trump might have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me. And Hillary Clinton threatened me. I dont think there's any comparison." -Jaunita Broderick, Bill Clinton rape survivor. TRUMP 2016
3 | Marc James | Regardless if you like Trump or not - Paul Ryan is showing his true character flaws by not sticking it out to save his own reputation.  Little does he know that his failure to be a friend in times of turmoil has ruined it.
4 | David Dabb | Let's not elect this guy because he said something nasty... Lets vote the individual in who has lied and did this Country and those serving wrong. Because, of course, none of us have never said something bad.... right?
5 | Tanya Borders | Vote Trump November 8th no matter what the polls say or what the media throws at us. We have to stand up and take our country back!
6 | Patrick J Higgins | Donald Trump helped Paul Ryan by endorsing him during his primary challenge. He did so while Ryan had still not endorsed Trump showing he could be a bigger man about it. Now Paul Ryan goes and stabs Trump in the back. Lower than a snake and no class.
7 | Michael Callison | ME: "Hi, I would like to order a big, fat beautiful wall, 4 bald eagle eggs sunny side up, with some freedom and #winning on the side, and a large red, white and blue, please hold the lies and corruption."WAITER: "You mean the Donald J. Trump?"ME: *tears welling up*-- "I'll take two. You can keep the hope and change."
8 | Andrew Doddridge | If the Republican leaders would go after Obama half as much as they do Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, Obama would not be getting away with half of the lawlessness he's done in his presidency.
9 | Robin Barron | America, this election is not about personalities it is about principles. Do we want to keep the values that America was founded on? America was founded on a Biblical worldview. The question is will we keep America‚Äôs heritage or sell out to a communist worldview?
10 | Dawn L. Morey | So True! Paul Ryan should be ashamed of himself today. Trump won the debate BIG TIME and then Ryan comes out and tries to undermine him AGAIN. ENOUGH! Ryan needs to step down or support our nominee. This is disgusting. The people have spoken and TRUMP is the nominee, get on board the train or step down!!!!!
11 | Bella Ladin | Ryan is a turncoat and the worst leader of the Republican party I've witnessed.  How on earth do you hold a position like that and desert your candidate!!!!
12 | Steve Withers | When is Fox going to cut Shep loose?He's got a huge bias against Trump. Fascist? Really? Trump just wants the system to work. He doesn't want to use the FBI to sweep this stuff under the carpet. That's what fascists do.
13 | Morrissey RC | Mr. Trump did more last night in his prosecution of The Clinton Dynasty than Paul Ryan has accomplished in his whole wishy washy, two faced, traitorous career.....
14 | Lois Chears | Best answer of the debate when Trump answered who he would appoint to the Supreme Court?"Those that would uphold the Constitution."Shows where his heart is. Trump loves America. Hillary's answer pertained to her agenda - not constitution.
15 | Franklin Branch | Paul Ryan, you are a joke. Not only will I vote for #Trump, i will NOT vote for anyone on the down ticket that does not support Donald Trump. Period. I urge others to do the same. #paulryanisa2facedsnakeHis web page reports his wealth at nearly 8 million dollars. Just another career politician.
16 | Luis Sotero | Paul Ryan is to face imature self-serving brat... I think he should be booted so you can go back to making Cheddar cheese... Republicans should stand next to one another as if we're family. Not take the sides that benefit one another political agenda paul ryan needs to be boycotted and removed from his position he's not a to republican. He's a to face idiot
17 | Sheila Kern Renfro | I totally agree, I thought Paul Ryan was a republican guess he has decided to switch parties...he is a disgrace to America and the Republican Party.  There was a time when I admired him...absolutely not any more!  He needs to resign!
18 | Judy Eckerd | I think it is absolutely terrible that several of the Republicans won't endorse Trump because of something that happened 11 yrs. ago, but the Democrats don't mind endorsing Hillary knowing she is a felon and should have been indicted.  None of it makes any sense.
19 | Karen Buechs | ED KLEIN: ‚ÄúThe very people, including many, many Republicans, who got on their high horse, their self-righteous high horses about this, are the same guys who turn on pornography when they are traveling in Marriott hotels, and who often sleep with their secretaries on Capitol Hill, and do many more, worse things than Donald Trump has done in his life.‚Äù
20 | Robert Foster | You people go right back to bill clinton, he is not running now trump is.Trump is the shame of the GOP, do you want your sons, to think its okay to grope females.You want to place a person in office, who was not man enough to aoplogize to the central park five, who he slammed in the press and were found not guilty.The kind of white people who support trump. think obama was not born here, they think all police shootings of black people are justified.Your average trump supporter, who drank the trump kool aid, thinks all of islam is evil, and all mexicans are crooks.
21 | Auxi Paez Triebel | Yes, I agree one hundred percent, he hasn't done a darn important thing for America and its citizens, instead he has given Obama everything he wants including trillions in $ so Obama can keep finishing his vicious agenda against America before he leaves. Ryan Is probably in Hillary's pocket like many republicans politicians are. They Don't care about the job they were sworn to do, all they care is to line their pockets. Ryan received $2 million plus just for signing the TPP for Obama.
22 | Scott Barton | Paul Ryan is placing his bets late in the game, even if you win or lose you still are a Republican that sucks like most of them. What's the difference between a Republican and Democrat? One likes beer and the other umbrella drinks when they both go to the bar after pretending they hate each other on msnbc.
23 | Randy Boren | If any of you women (or people in general) think that "your man" has never, at some point in their lives "objectified" a woman then you are oh so miserably naive! Only Jesus Christ has never done such. Same with the women! How hypocritical of a society we are!!!! #paulryan has himself done it a time or two I PROMISE.
24 | John Hurley | We as a single country have gathered few other to fight an idea. War against terrorism is impossible to win. You can't beat and idea with lead and gunpowder. You can only beat an idea with another....freedom.The world needs to turn on these sociopaths! These extremists are trying to slow or stop the idea of freedom.We the few can't accomplish what it take many for victory.Hillary nor Trump can be in charge of this country. Even Jill and Gary are unfit. We the people need a common man...blue color, middle-class president. These rich greedy succubi can't help the People. They only help themselves and their friends. We need a highly decorated veteran with a great background and views of a safe country.We need to bring home all of our boys worry about fixing home without bloodshed.
25 | Charles Goodman | This election will come down to a few counties in a very few states. to win those counties you must appeal to white suburban women. In my opinion if you are not actively doing things to attract those voters (not the ones you already have) then you will lose. Trump fighting with people that have to make a stand so they can get elected is dumb. Because if he loses and the house and senate go to the Dems, it will be the fault of trump voters that do not understand simple math. Then unfortunately she will win an have free reign and we will never be able to come back

‚ÄúHer problem is 33,000 emails deleted is real. Making millions of dollars‚Ä¶while you‚Äôre serving the government is real.‚Äù

Newt Gingrich said Hillary Clinton could not dispute the facts about her record that Donald J. Trump brought up during the debate.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dan Hapner | Think about this for a second....Everyone knows jared fougle right ( the subway guy) everyone knows that he had child porn on his computer and his phone. Well lets say he got a heads up from the fbi that he was under investigation..... they subpoena his laptop and phone.... but first he says he wants to delete his family vacation photos and stuff then uses bleach bit to wipe his computer clean..... and smashes his phone... just like hillary.... but lets say the fbi finds around 10 pics he missed..... we know the fbi found over 100 classified emails.... so would you think he should still be in jail after all of that? I say most definitely he should be.... And i say HELL yes hillary should be too....
2 | Kevin Michel | Mr Trump... this retired army veteran is truly excited about your coming administration... can't wait!!! I'm so tired of hearing how "republicans are abandoning Trump." It's not so, the corrupt Washington politicians, whom some claim to be republicans and never supported him in the first place are only showing their true colors... Americans stand with Trump!
3 | Todd Burnette | Remember , we are FINISHED with the Clintons in 29 days. #Trumptrain The 3rd Debate should be held at a BIG Trump rally and let the Deplorable s be the moderators...!
4 | Rudy Gadrey | House Speaker Paul Ryan told Republican lawmakers in a conference call that he will spend "his entire energy making sure that Hillary Clinton does not get a blank check with a Democrat-controlled Congress."
5 | Cavell Dwyer | NBC had this video of Trump for 11 years, odd that they released it now....right when Hillary's private speeches were released.  Funny that every American knows about the Trump video..how many know that Hillary, in a speech, said that she wants open boarders...allow 600 million people to flow through, how about her statement of how she has to say one thing to the american public but another to her donors??  Odd that.
6 | Dan Hogan | I find hillary obscene.  She is a self proclaimed Progressive, party speak for Communist. Leftists know how difficult it is to impose socialism on an armed populace, thus her interest in "Reasonable Chicago Style Gun Controls."
7 | Mitch Sirota | Yet some words trump said in 05 matter more to some people.. clearly there's a problem in this country when it comes to priorities
8 | Chris Sutton | Everyone should take a second and blow up the left wing liberal Facebook pages with Trump/Pence 2016 support, Hillary for Prison, and expose not only Bills Rape, but how the media refuses to Report it unbiased.. Hammer MSNBC CNN NBC CBS NBC meet the press, Chris Mathews Chuck Todd George snorklenose all of them!! Dont quit till they boot ya! Show them your tired of the bias and they can't steal this one! Give us liberty or give us death!!
9 | Amaury Francisco Guerrero | While the MSM entertains us with BS stories that don't matter like (the Kardashian arm robbery, Trump's leaked conversation and other stupid stories) WWIII is around the corner and most Americans are ignorant to this very important and dangerous fact. Both Obama and Hillary created the chaos in Libya, they murdered Gaddaffi and since 2011 they have been trying to do the same thing in Syria, the difference is that unlike Libya, Syria has strong and loyal allies that are willing to fight and defend it. (Russia, China and Iran.) Aleppo has a population of 2 millions people and more that 1.5 millions of them live in Assad controlled area and only 200 thousands in the Al Qaeda (also known as moderate rebels according to Obama) controlled part of the city. The bottom line is that Putin has outsmarted Obama and the Russians and the Syrians are winning the war and the US, its lackeys and the terrorists they support and fund are losing it.  Now the US has been given a choice. Either it will carry through with its threats of attacking the Syrian Army and start a nuclear war with Russia and very likely China, or it will accept the fact that the world is no longer unipolar, and begin to integrate into the new format. We don‚Äôt know what choice Washington will make. The American political establishment has a sufficient number of ideologically-blinded, incompetent figures who are ready to burn up in a nuclear fire with the rest of a humanity rather than recognize the end of US world hegemony, which has turned out to be short-lived, senseless, and criminal. But they have to make a choice, because the longer that Washington pretends that nothing has happened, the greater the number of its vassals (who are called their allies, but have long since been bogged down in dependency) will openly and explicitly ignore American ambitions and cross over to the other side of the new perspectives of global power arrangement.  It is time for the American people to throw these people out and take their country back before it is too late.
10 | Cee Pete | He might have a foul mouth way back when, but she is pure evil.  Never trust a smiler who is trying to make a point in a speech, she is lying through her teeth.
11 | Barbara Rader Horn | Trump Pence 2016, Ladies and gentlemen it's time for us to move on and help change the residents of the White House in 2017! Some concerns I personally have, if Clinton should win, is Supreme Court appointments, abortions, Benghazi and open borders. Our God is good and He is in charge.!
12 | Jerry Braam | I'm voting for AMERICA !!!!~Getting rid of our corrupt Government! ~Securing our borders to make us safe again! ~Keeping the (long proven) Korrupt Klinton Klan out of out Whitehouse!!! ~Have u noticed? The establishment is afraid of Trump. ~B/c he is getting rid of all the career criminal politicians. ~That's what I want! ~Obama and the rest of the career politicians are against Trump. That alone makes me vote for him!!!! ~I am an American .... Of course I am voting for TRUMP!
13 | Lori Beaubien Rogers | Not to change the subject but, I see no other way to post this. I just got done watching Megyn Kelly on the The Howard Stern Show. As a woman who professes she has never talked in a vulgar manner, I disagree!I just listened to her discuss her husband's genitals among many other things. Very distasteful!This would be after I saw extremely racy, raunchy pics of her!  WTH is going on over at Fox News?How can anybody take Megyn Kelly as a serious journalist with this history?  Her talk was offensive to all women she professes to represent!
14 | Greg Pleak | She lies so much that she couldn't look anyone in the audience in the eye nor any of the reporters on her plane after the debate . Even brought up Honest Abe and tried to use an Ethiopian kid . She just babbled about nothing
15 | Deborah Bussell | Anyone who walks on water step forward. Didn't think so. We know Trump was no choir boy. We aren't so naive to think he didn't live a life we couldn't imagine. He spoke badly years ago and says he is a changed man. No doubt more tapes to come. He didn't live his life planning to be POTUS. I accept his apology. We support him because of his message!  We must care MORE about OUR country than the gutter politics to destroy him or anyone running against the queen. Trump must stay and fight or we are done. America is done!!!
16 | Crystal Morey | So I'm guessing those 33,000 emails were private emails between her and family members...??? If they were only private emails then she wouldn't have a problem showing them... Saying, look see private nothing to worry about... Those kind of make you suspicious when you delete all of those doesn't it
17 | Tiago Gomes | This election is no longer Republicans vs Democrats! Its the people versus the goverment, biased media, establishment politicians, annoying liberal Hollywood stars, corrupt politicians and most importantly lying politicians!!! Trump is the man who can lead the movement!!! This will be my first time voting and you 100% have my vote Mr. Trump!!! #StudentsForTrump
18 | Stephen Gilbert | I keep hearing that Megan Kelly is a Hillary supporter and i am begining to believe it after watching several of her interviews. Why do we keep having her aired on FOX! its the one news outlet that we can hear the other side of the story not cnn or abc side. I will not watch fox when she is on anymore and this news outlet should consider other venues!
19 | David Steele | I'd like this summary just once from Trump:"I build, she destroys.When I hire people, they build skyscrapers.When she hires people, they destroy phones with hammers.When I hire people, they build beautiful resorts.When she hires people, they delete thousands of emails.When you ask my employees what they've done, they point proudly to skyscrapers and resorts, and they say 'I built that.'When you ask her employees what they've done, they answer 'On the advice of my attorneys, I plead the Fifth Amendment.'As president, I'll build an America you can be proud of, not one where you'll need an immunity deal to avoid prison."
20 | Doris Knaus | Thank God for Fox News. CNN seems to be all Hillary. Wonder how they will survive Trump win. Feeling sad for CNN. Maybe getting paid by Democratic Party to be so bias. If all they have to go on is some decade ago tapes.
21 | Debra O'Connor | Shep is on now just tearing down Trump, send him to cnn!! Cant even watch him n Kelly anymore!!! Sick of the lying polls too! My God, his rallies are thousands!! Hers not even hundreds, ridiculous media!!
22 | Bill Jenkins | Personally I feel there is a large contingency of voters that are saying nothing. NO yard signs, no bumper stickers. If asked they might say Hillary so as not to be seem by the elite as a radical. I know the prognosticators say this is just wishful thinking. MAybe, but these are the same folks who told us a year ago Trump finally made the remark that would finish him off! So here we are 29 days out. My thinking Trump wins and turn a couple states red that have been blue for years! And there will be many prestigious prognosticators lining up for unemployment.
23 | Peggy Lohr | She stood there with a stupid smirk on her face, trying to make it seem that she was saying can you believe this guy?  Nothing but lies, see what I have to deal with??  Problem is the smirk just made her look dumb instead of superior.
24 | Nancy Mitchell Gilliam | I still will NEVER vote for Hillary.  I am thinking that what is being said about his foul mouth comments is more of this "Oh I my ears are offended. I need a safe space."  Get real and grow up. Offensive things get said. Does not change the politics of what is happening to our country.
25 | Jane Marondera | I can't imagine Donald J. Trump walking up to a podium giving a speech as president of the United States but I can see him in a strait jacket being taken away kicking and screaming on November 8th after losing the race. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòπüòπüòπüòπüòπ

Live: Mike Pence holds a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | KathyLarry Graff | Why is the media NOT reporting on the part of the emails released by Wikileaks that she wrote referring to Muslim's as Sand N*ggers? Why is this NOT being reported on? Shameful......
2 | Brittany Nicole | If Abraham Lincoln was truly like Hillary, he would have gone from dead broke to $300 million by making a personal profit off the Civil War
3 | Heidi Gehret | A vote for Hillary is a vote for open borders and a 500% increase in refugees..how does that help our kids? Our vets? Our wages?

13 | Robin Barron | Lord, please open the eyes of America to the Truth (Hillary's progressiveness is code word for COMMUNISM) God Bless America and keep us Free!
14 | Norma Adrover | Is ironic that the tape insted of hurting Trump help him gave him the push he need to talk stand and look like the president we need to run this nation!!! Everything happens for a reason let God works his magic!
15 | Joyce Cardoza Duhaine | I really like this man. Speaks his heart and isn't afraid to make a stand for the country.

"[Anderson] Cooper started the fireworks on the second question with four follow-up questions attempting to skewer Trump on the latest video controversy about offensive things he said on an open mic. That set the tone for the evening and it wasn‚Äôt a neutral one." ‚ÄìDan Gainor
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Irene Meserve Dowling | I just do not understand how any true red blooded American could even think about voting for Hillary after her cover up of Benghazi and Emails !! The only thing she has proven is she is a BIG liar and above the law ! She is truly a woman of zero integrity and belongs in prison NOT running for our president !
2 | Lauren Huff | I do not condone what he said ... But if we start calling that rape ... We have a lot of people to arrest , including many females .
3 | Dawn L. Morey | The moderators are not journalists, they are activists and they have an agenda. Why don't we have Laura Ingraham as one of the moderators??? It is all rigged for the leftists.
4 | Celia Mayes | Mr. Trump you were the winner of the second debate by far, and believe me... we are behind you all the way. I think it was a marvelous idea to have the victimized women in the audience of those who were taken advantage of by Bill Clinton when he was president and got impeached - we definitely don't need another Clinton she's a train wreck!!!
5 | Dustie Cole | Give me a break. Hillary feigns outrage over Trump's locker room trash talk (it IS trash - however, as a former sports reporter I've heard much worse in locker rooms. I kinda think Hill has too. If not, she needs to close her virgin ears and just wish away her participation in extremely crude conversations and activities wherein she's caught on tape). Hills calls Trump's tone "horrific".  Amazingly, based on complicit silence, here are things Hillary DOESN'T find "horrific" (hat tip commenters on conservativetreehouse.com):*Her own husband's affairs, rape, abusing his power with young interns, humiliating and discrediting victims ad nauseam;  *Cops murdered with Black Lives Matters activists taking side with the killers;*The ISIS sex slave industry;*Genital female mutilation by Muslims;*Americans left to die in Benghazi at the hands of US backed terrorists;*Americans murdered and/or raped by illegal aliens and "refugees" (she still wants open borders!);*Various terrorist attacks;*ISIS torturing and murdering their captured by horrendous methods that make water boarding look like a walk in the park;*ISIS and Al Queda throwing homosexuals off roofs of buildings just for being who they are;*Snuffing life out of innocent babies just inches from being born;*The late Sen. Byrd's (her "mentor") KKK roots;*Saul Alinksy's life-destroying politics-of-personal-destruction;*Saul Alinsky's (another quoted "mentor"?!) work dedication to Satan;*The plight of inner city youths who get shot in the streets by gangs;*The plight of inner city youths stuck in failing schools with government-prohibited opportunity for competitive education venues;*Iran growing its dangerous nuclear program even after vowing to destroy Israel, thanks to her participation in the most dangerous deal America finds herself in;*Corrupt pay-to-play crony deals to enrich herself with deals like handing 20% of America's valuable uranium supply to Russia; .... and goodness, there are more. All this, yet it's a political opponent's past verbiage she deems "horrific". - Sarah Palin
6 | Frank Lampone | Trump delivered an A$$ Whoopin to Crooked Hillary and Slick Willy last night. She'd have been better off to keep her lying mouth shut about Donald's potty mouth. He deserves a bar of soap. Hillary opened the door for a full on assault on Bill who should have gone to jail. If the CNN moderators want to join the debate then they should have to run for the office! How is it that we are worried about someone's potty mouth but dismiss real criminal activities.
7 | Jan Hobbs Chapman | It was just UNBELIEVABLE and the moderators just get away with it!!  I'M VOTING STRAIGHT TICKET REPUBLICAN!!  #hillaryforprison #neverhillary
8 | Gwen Gordon | He sure held his ground. I can't imagine how hard it must be to go into a debate knowing the commentators are against you and are armed with every goof up you have ever done in your life while glossing over everything negative about your opponent. She is like a mafia boss lady who could care less what she destroys in her wake as long as she gets what she wants
9 | Teri Layton Mantle | As usual, the moderators were doing everything they could to crush Trump.  He even called them out on it, but to no avail.  However, last night, Trump beat all three of his opponents - Hillary and both moderators.
10 | Michele Lynn | Of course twinkle toes Anderson would be on her side, funny those who she cater's to, like to throw people like him off high buildings.
11 | Lisa A Coyner | Trump does not need moderators, he took that debate over and ran it like he owned it......He exposed Hillary for the crook she really is and made Cooper and the ole hag look like they were amateurs...Kudos to Donald J. Trump
12 | Scott Smith | It was indeed biased, and I think it's because "journalists" have been pressured to more critical of Trump.   On a side note, Anderson Cooper never grabbed someone by her p...y.   :-)
13 | Greg Dye | Don't forget about Megan Kelly after the debate. She was saying all she could to rain on Trump's victory. Even tried to defend Bill and Hillary concerning the rape victims who were in the audience! Fox, you need to send her packing!
14 | Bermis Alvarez | Its interesting how the moderator brought up trumps offensive private conversation of 11 yrs ago but didn't bring up the 33,000 deleted emails, a real issue! What a friking joke
15 | Dave Farrar | Trump destroyed her! 3 against 1 and he won! THATS what our country needs, a fighter who stands up! Not afraid for what he believes in! He's a fighter and who we need running this country!
16 | Sarah Cardin | Donald Trump was at a debate that was 3 v. 1 and he proved he could stand on his own. Then telling Hillary she would be in jail was the best. Loved how he put Cooper in his place, and after he made the comment about how biased and rigged the debate was, was when they started to tell Hillary she was going over her time. They were foolish enough to think they had "I got you questions" and Trump was ready.
17 | Albert Galindo | The news media attacking Mr. Trump on what he said 11 years ago, Hillary Clinton defended a rapist of a 12 years old victim then braggs about how Hillary defebded him. Hillary destroyed a 12 year old little girl on the witness stand and the media doesn't see nothing worng with this. The media should be a shame for not reporting this awefull act of evil.
18 | Kimberly Taylor Cavish | I completely agree. I watched the whole thing and the bias from the moderators was obvious.  Also this reporting that he was stalking her around the stage and trying to intimidate never happened.  Watching it in real time, you would see both candidates moving around the platform as they worked out their responses.  Photograph stills are just another way of manipulating opinions.
19 | Amanda M Turnidge | The moderators need to just keep their mouths shut. I'm so over this crap. Ready for Trump to take office and be done with this horrific nightmare of an election.
20 | Eileen Matuza | It's no longer about Republican vs. Democrat.It's all of us Americans vs the Politicians, the media, special interests, lobbyists, foreign countries, Wall Street, the drug companies, hollywood, and the Washington elitist.Never again will we have a chance to take our country back from the globalist agenda they're cramming down our throats, It's now, or never.Please get out and vote, do it for your children & your grandchildren. Stop the Muslim invasion of our country and our way of life. Be true to your country, your values, and your heritage. Vote for the American, not the politician.God Bless.üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
21 | Kaysie Blankenship Hart | I felt his behavior this debate was stellar! She didn't rattle him and he kept it in check. The first debate he allowed her to strut and crow and appear to be in control (I felt this was intentional knowing there were two more debates) She and the moderators attempted to distract/rattle him (and us) by crucifying him w the audio. WE DONT CARE ABOUT AN AUDIO. He did great at steering them (3 against 1!) back into right direction and I'm just proud he didn't punch her in the throat. This was his make it or break it moment; I have never been fond of him, but after last night and the manner in which he handled the dem's attempt to smear him; I'm more of a Trump fan than ever!
22 | Carol Whitesel Standeven | What about the serial Democrat womanizers and abusers that kept being elected ... Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton, for example.
23 | Dan Hapner | Think about this for a second....Everyone knows jared fougle right ( the subway guy) everyone knows that he had child porn on his computer and his phone. Well lets say he got a heads up from the fbi that he was under investigation..... they subpoena his laptop and phone.... but first he says he wants to delete his family vacation photos and stuff then uses bleach bit to wipe his computer clean..... and smashes his phone... just like hillary.... but lets say the fbi finds around 10 pics he missed..... we know the fbi found over 100 classified emails.... so would you think he should still be in jail after all of that? I say most definitely he should be.... And i say HELL yes hillary should be too....
24 | Sharon M DeMayo | Actually it started with the very first question. And then it followed by how he wasn't going to allow Trump to rebuttal Killarys answer. It was straight out of the gate. He shouldn't be aloud to moderate any longer. What happened to all the good news reporters I grew up with? (Rhetorical question - I know what happened to them) It will never be the same. Only gets worse.
25 | Faye Law | Trump said something very nice about Clinton, that she was a fighter! So were the other 16 or 17 he beat! Plus Clinton has refused interviews and stayed hid most of this year! To me that's not a true fighter , that's someone hoping Trump would hurt himself ! If she took question it would have killed her and Sanders would be in her place! Trump has won this on his own without the RNC and news media and bought supporters!

House Speaker Paul Ryan told lawmakers Monday he will not defend or campaign with Donald J. Trump, and that they should do what is best for their own districts. http://fxn.ws/2cQKNNC
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Godswill Forche | Paul Ryan, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush, Mitch McConnell, John Kasich and the other Prominent Republicans never come out and CRITICISE Hillary Clinton or hold her ACCOUNTABLE for her actions or her CRIMES. But guess what? When it comes to Donald Trump, they can't wait to POUNCE on him and shred him to pieces.Just like the Mainstream Media does.I think most of these Republican elites are just Democrats in GOP skin.
2 | CJ Del | So what. Whether you like Trump or not, a Trump Presidency is a threat to the entire political system.It will demonstrate that the highest office in the land does not have to go to a career politician. That "The People" are the ones who determine who will be President. Should this happen it will definitively prove that every political office is up for grabs by "We The People", from the highest office to the lowest. This is what the establishment fears most.
3 | Mandi Marie | We don't need you Paul Ryan Trump will pick a great cabinet and make this country better Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me üòÇüòÇüòÇ trump is just a big meanie but killarys actions don't bother you Just wow Go trump
4 | Franklin Branch | Paul Ryan, you are a joke. Not only will I vote for #Trump, i will NOT vote for anyone on the down ticket that does not support Donald Trump. Period. I urge others to do the same. #paulryanisa2facedsnake
5 | John Buffinton | He's been a closet Democrat for years! What kind of self respecting Republican would tell his people to basically vote for Hillary!
6 | Patricia Losh | Oh my, whatever will we do!  We are doomed!   Get over yourself Ryan you lost the respect of many republican voters a long while back
7 | Jack Blackburn III | Paul Ryan sucks. He gives GOP a bad name. Establishment should be kicked out of the Republican party. They hold our party back.
8 | Connie Shull Hester | He's a RINO anyway.  He thinks he is going to run in 2020 and that is what he is aiming for.  He was never a Trump supporter anyway
9 | Rod Simmons | Well I certainly don't agree with what Mr. Trump said on that video, but where would we have been after WWII if General Patton had been booted out for his foul mouth remarks? Trump apologized and so now that's between him and the Lord. We just need someone to right this country!
10 | Mike Carlin | Spineless and doesn't care about the Republican voter but you people in Wisconsin keep electing these spineless politicians
11 | Landi White Hart | Any Republican politician who doesn't respect the people's decision to make Trump the candidate, should be voted out of office.
12 | Karen Kelly Langan | Paul Ryan and all the other so called Republicans..would rather see a Corrupt Government because you are a part of this.. You don't have a party left ever again if this happens.
13 | Steve Jawback | This came from the Advocate (our local paper) and I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump.  The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."
14 | Christopher Cook | The sooner Paul Ryan jumps ship & joins The Democrats the better for The Republicans..Maybe he could take Kasich,Romney & the Bushes with him when he goes..
15 | William Artrip | Thank you Paul Ryan for doing your part in turning registered Republican voters into Independent or Democrat voters. You are a perfect example of why I will vote for Donald J Trump and NOT a straight Republican ticket. The GOP is dead to me thanks to establishment leaders like yourself.
16 | Linda Cella | Hey Mr. Ryan, you are one of the reasons that Donald Trump is doing so well. We The People are sick and tired of The Establishment so we are glad you are NOT WITH TRUMP!!
17 | Melissa Adams Wright | With this position, either way, he mostly likely will suffer future political losses. Ryan is way out of touch. He might as well become an independent or a democrat.
18 | Diane Jeffcoat | I love how people like Paul Ryan like to get votes by saying he's a family man and committed Christian. Christ would not be judging Mr. Trump of sins a decade ago when he's changed and has given his heart to Jesus. 'Christians' like Mr. Ryan give Christianity a bad name.
19 | David Shouler | thanks the from the softest man in America. Another politician who's agenda is to only win elections, not do what the country needs
20 | Rhonda Guenther | Paul Ryan has been a huge disappointment since he has been speaker of the house, he has allowed Obama to walk all over him and therefore we the people. He needs to grow a set and support the better choice
21 | Lisa Marie Kelsey | Seriously though? All the politicians and media monger celebrities can save their breath telling us that they will not support Donald Trump. Actually, it makes me love him more. I guess they didn't get the memo that we don't care what they think. Maybe Hillary deleted it? Anywhoooo, they are insignificant to us in our lives. Americans have been awoken, and we will not be silenced. #MAGA
22 | Marlene Harvey | Paul Ryan has no backbone. The Republican Party didn't nominate Trump, the American people did. I am an Independent voter, a college educated (3 degrees) suburban woman and I wholeheartedly support Donald Trump.
23 | Mark Rit | Hey ASSHATS in the Republican party that feel they don't need to support Trump. You just lost the support of the voters. WE decide who will be president, not the leadership of the RNC or the DNC. Trump being the candidate is OUR message to YOU that we are sick of the way you do things. It WILL change now.
24 | Virgil Kupfer | Paul Ryan is a coward to support the GOP candidate winner. Ryan need pull up his big boy pants and act like a man and campaign for Trump the next president. Trump has a plan for America. Vote for Trump this November.
25 | Diane Jeffcoat | That's the difference between parties. The democrat party heads stand behind you no matter how scuzzy you are....Republican Party heads run for the back foot the minute a rain cloud comes around the candidate running for office. Look up Tom Delay in Wikipedia and other sights. See how the republicans deserted him and pushed him out of office when the democrats brought bogus charges against him for campaign money laundering. This was a man of integrity who (rumors say ) would most likely run for president and the democrats were terrified that he would win. After being left stranded by his party, and found guilty ONLY after taking the case to several judges who refused to take the case, the fix was in and he was found guilty. THAT made the headlines. Once he was no longer a threat, the democrats left him alone. His appeal found him not guilty but that never made the headlines. I'm sure he totally gets Mr. Trump.

On Fox & Friends, Gov. Mike Pence shot down reports that he was considering leaving the Republican presidential ticket and said Donald J. Trump "stepped up and won a debate last night that seemed to be against all odds." http://bit.ly/2dJLfPG
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dan Facette Purr | ,,,,,I come from Canada and watched debate,, it was clearly biased,, CNN reporter was always's rude to Trump ,, and clinton surpassed her time 60 % more then Trump and never was stopped with rudeness, clinton said she doesn't like dictators,, USA being so bought by obamma and clinton that its become dictators itself's,
2 | Carla Alves | BEST COME BACK IN DEBATE HISTORY?HILLARY CLINTON: It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country."DONALD TRUMP: "Because you would be in jail."
3 | Rebecca Chuamsky | I'm sick and tired of those who say Hitlery has no great accomplishments. I would say staying out of prison for the crimes she committed in the last four decades is an accomplishment.
4 | Lois Chears | Best answer of the debate when Trump answered who he would appoint to the Supreme Court?"Those that would uphold the Constitution."Shows where his heart is. Trump loves America. Hillary's answer pertained to her agenda - not constitution.
5 | Jack Selby | Donald J. Trump always has good, intelligent people around him, and he will do the same when he is our next president, and he will make America the great country it deserves to be, and the Obama/Clinton era will finally be over and a big mistake of the past.
6 | Devie McAdams | As a black man So proud of mr. Trump's performance last night outstanding why would a two-term president dropped out?
7 | Cathy Ridenhour | Bill O Rilley said that 3 media stations told there employees if any of them were reporting anything good on Trump they will be FIRED. This is what is wrong with polls and with American..
8 | Hope Devenuto | It shows you how corrupt our government is by them allowing Hillary to run for office. She nor her party has any vision for this country. Their only vision is to always deceive it's citizens. Wake up ladies and grow up for words can never harm you. Hillary has no substance. This is not about woman power if that's what swings you. It's about real issues on what has she done in 30 yrs. Why is she all of a sudden going to do something. If we mishandled trillions of dollars wouldn't we be fired from our positions? Why would you broadcast your war strategies so that your enemies know what you are doing? Also, is allowing illegal immigrants to vote fair to people who haven't been able to? Really? Frustration is what I and millions of others feel... Clean out the corruption in our government and the media. This debate was a knockout win and a great come back for Donalds campaign. In 30 yrs No one has ever put the Clinton's in their place from any Republican party. Powerful Donald Trump has and so needed to show that leadership is not about political correctness, but to be strong and respond in truth for its people, which evidently the media, the government nor hollywood has no interest in doing. They all rake it in to persuade you. and distract you from what is real. Kudos to the truth!
9 | Nelda Taylor Havener | If these Republicans think they can make it without the Trump supporters, they need to think again. Most of us have voted Republican and we are tired of your nonsense. Most of those withdrawing support never supported him to begin with. We will vote in the future and we won't forget your actions.
10 | Roger Lucas | Trump for president should be the motto of all the down trodden people who are in the poverty population. Welfare will never get you off your feet and make your lives better. We need people who can help get you off the welfare roll and improve your life. It is not hard to pick yourself up by the boot straps and make you productive people so you can raise you ffamily in a fashion that makes you proud of yourself.
11 | Jerry Berger | Chris Wallace needs to start the next debate with this." By now , all the American people know what each candidate thinks about the moral integrity of the other candidate and they are aware of all the skeletons in the candidates closets, so this debate is going to strictly be about policy and the candidates vision for America. That is what the American people want"
12 | Dom Fernandez | there definitely was BIAS ... especially @andersoncooper and his repeated questioning @realDonaldTrump ... but I couldn't help noticing how dejected @andersoncooper looked towards the end of the debate! @realDonaldTrump won  - hands-down!
13 | Laura Doris Irwin | I think the Trump Pence ticket is going to be a winner! Both guys swimming hard upstream, and doing a great job! Keep up the great work!
14 | Carmen Brouillet | Forget political correctness!!! We must call things like they are!!! This is about SAVING OUR COUNTRY from corruption. lies and deceit!!! America is worth it!!! We must vote Trump/Pence Nov 8!!!
15 | Michele Cook Scardina | Thank you for sticking by him through thick and thin!  It takes a man of great character!  Let he who has not sinned throw the first stone!
16 | Lonnie Mayes Sr. | All I care about concerning Fox News, is when are they going to get rid of Megan Kelly !I turn the channel when she comes on at 9:00 PM. And they let her cover the debates and election as well.So I will not be watching Fox News period anymore, until they do away with that ugly snarky woman.She actually brought up a clip of her argument with Donald Trump trying to vindicate her point and deface Trump."Bye, Bye, Fox News... And good luck with your ratings.
17 | David Brigmanjr | what's up with megan kelly !!  she just kept on & on about trump !! I think she's for hillary don't like her as much as I use too. tries to be funny and she's not
18 | Sara Brown | I want them to ask her about the Bosnia sniper lie... You know, the one where she was under sniper fire and had to be rushed to safety even though she was on the tarmac taking pictures with children. Why did she come up with such a story? What narrative was she promoting?
19 | Jim Furber | Hillary has a worse temper that Donald ever had ... just look at all the reports by her security detachment while she was in the White House as first lady and Secretary of State .......... she was brutal and foul mouthed.http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/06/28/ex-secret_service_agent_people_need_to_know_the_real_hillary_clinton_and_how_dangerous_she_is.html
20 | Ralph A Solli | The debates are useless. It was again evident that the moderators were bias and did all they could to trip Donald Trump. Again as with the first debate, it didn't work, and only demonstrated how corrupt and one-sided the liberal media is. America is now used to their faux journalism and finds them irrelevant.
21 | Diane Webster | I know the media is bias and I know CNN is the Clinton News Network but I am outraged that Anderson Cooper actually asked Hillary if she felt Donald Trump had the discipline to be President. Are you kidding me. I was outraged. He already knew the answer. That precious time could,have been used for the audience to ask both candidates a question. Anderson Cooper should be asked to explain why he did this. Shame on you Anderson Cooper for your lack of professionalism.
22 | Franklin Branch | Paul Ryan, you are a joke. Not only will I vote for #Trump, i will NOT vote for anyone on the down ticket that does not support Donald Trump. Period. I urge others to do the same. #paulryanisa2facedsnake
23 | Martha Armstrong | Please publish a list of the REPUBLICAN senators and house members who were in office when Bill Clinton was president and how many publically objected to HIS conduct....let's be fair and balanced......
24 | Jan Hobbs Chapman | Thank you VP Pence!!  We need to stand together to defeat the corrupt, lying, evil Hillary!!  #hillaryforprison #neverhillary
25 | Joe Aytch | After last night's outing of the crimes surrounding the Clinton dynasty, I couldn't be more proud to cast my vote for Donald Trump. You'd be in jail, Hillary! We know it, you know it, everybody knows it!

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Beulah Marie | I am so glad that someone finally said all of those things directly to her smug, lying, corrupt, evil face!!!! That was awesome! All of us "deplorables" wish we could have the opportunity to do exactly the same thing! She'd know what (c) meant when I was done with her!!! I loathe that (b)!! .......... ** Hey liberal media..... why don't you "fact check" what was said by the 4 women who appeared with Trump right before the debate?
2 | Matthew Gunnoe | Like if you believe Hillary has no chance because no matter how much tabloid sleeze they dig up on Trump, Hillary is an overt crook and threat to this country. The voters are ultimately smarter than that.
3 | Gibbie Gibson | Thank you Mr. Trump for bringing the truth about Benghazi ~ Reality check that almost brought me to tears was this....‚ÄúAmbassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúAnd the only one Hillary talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who‚Äôs her friend and not a good guy.‚Äù ~ How desperate those men must have felt that night in Benghazi knowing that our leaders had abandoned them!
4 | Bruno Cupo | I'm sick and tired of those who say Hillary has no great accomplishments. I would say staying out of prison for the crimes she committed in the last four decades is an accomplshment.
5 | Tracy Devine-Sutton | I am just thinking out loud but does anyone else remember Susan McDougal, the woman who went to jail for the Clintons in their cover up of white water? ......or the mysterious death of her husband James McDougal who later became a witness for the prosecution? Or how about Vince Foster, a Clinton Advisor who supposedly killed himself with a shot gun?ü§îü§î
6 | Mark Jones | Absolutely mind blowing to me that many of my fellow Christians won't vote for Trump and would willfully allow Clinton to destroy our religious freedoms and nation if elected. Mind blowing that so many people have been misled by the media. Mind blowing that people don't recognize that God is using Trump for His purpose and showing Trump humility. Transforming Trump slowly but surely in front of our eyes. How much humility, sincerity, and sorrow is expressed by Clinton for HER CRIMES, against her fellow Americans? How can anyone possibly think that another 4 to 8 years of progressive liberal policies and outright tyrannical, lawless, corruption be good for our nation? We've already witnessed how horrible it's been the last 8 years! Take your moral superiority hats off for 5 minutes, look at the BIG PICTURE, and WAKE UP!
7 | Danielle Mitchell | Hillary SAID she was ready to take on RUSSIA!! My head snapped at that comment! She wants us all to be nuked, I mean , she's the one who sold the uranium to them, so......... we all know where her loyalties LIE....
8 | Ronie Prinzing | We loved the debate last night. Most people don't know the truth about the Clinton's and Hillary's lies. We were happy to see Trump stand his ground & didn't buckle to the media and the establishment.
9 | Joni Bunch | Evil will not win! Media can throw everything at him cause they are running scared & they are losers! Facts: Hillary let 4 men die in Benghazi, deleted 33,000 emails, shut up women's mouth after he raped them, she's not for women or children cause she's for abortion & rapists, she stands with terrorist, refugees, immigrants, thugs & racist, all for flag burnings, she accepts money from our enemies to get favors, she gives our enemies weapons, she won't say radical Islamic terrorism cause she & obama created them, she's been there for 30 yrs & has done nothing, she's a race baiter, she along with obama tells the black community they are victims when in reality they can do & be whatever they want! She wants to take our rights away along with our guns so their precious Isis can come & take whatever they want & kill whoever they want & sharia law would be in affect, Obamacare is a disaster... you can't afford it & you get penalized for not being able to afford it! Her & obama is not doing anything for our vets... clearly America is not first when obama & Hillary are in charge. Trump facts: he's a businessman, he has said "mean" things & I don't care about his taxes! Best part, he's not a politician! He wants to put up a wall, kill our enemies & he's for America! Americans will actually come first, vets will come first. Choice is clear! My choice is trump! #gotrump!!! Next time.... bring the families of the the Benghazi men! üëç
10 | Vallory Deflumeri | Fox it's a shame !!! I thought y'all had more integrity than what you are showing ! I read Wikileaks.com that clearly identifies the news stations that agreed to support Kilary and you were one !! What a disappointment!!! Just know we the people know and will still support Trump in this election!
11 | Brenda Dreyer | Obama denied Hillary's request to have Blumenthal on her team at the Dept of State. Blumenthal had NO security clearance. Hillary discussed and shared Classified and Sensitive info with Blumenthal. That is a felony.
12 | Lynn McClain Ward | Yes,  it is so sad and at the same time, awful to think our Americans in Benghazi were waiting, believing and hoping there would be people coming to save them and there was no one ever coming....no one coming to help them and Hillary says - " What does it matter now?"  Ask their loved ones if it matters now....ask others who are in foreign countries thinking whether or not it matters that they maybe put in the same position...
13 | Margie Nichols | Dems are offering $5 million for any dirt that can be found on Trump - they are desperate to get Hillary in so they can keep covering up the corruption running rampant in our government - Trump would uncover things we have get to find out
14 | Lesa Leamons | Did anyone else notice that HRC was intentionally making Trump look like he was bullying her? What I saw was that she sat after she talked every time which could make it look as though he towered over her and also when she did talk she would walk to where he was standing making it look as if he was towering over her. I find it very odd that instantly after her camp said he was trying to intimidate her by towering over her when she talked when it was her positioning herself like that.
15 | Ed Kramer | How can anyone disagree, Hillary needs to be held accountable for her actions before this election is over. People, open your eyes, she will bring this country to its knees.
16 | Derrick Harper | The same way Hillary Clinton left Ambassador Steven's to die is the same way that she will do our troops if elected president. No way can Hillary Clinton be Commander in Chief. There's just no way.
17 | Mary Duzan Drzyzga | What she did was a sin!! She Killed those 4 men and wont admit it or even say the truth to their families!! She is a disgrace to America!!! Trump all the way & I am a woman, go figure, LOL
18 | Dan Hernandez | Romney and Mccain were afraid to do this the last 2 elections....admire that he can be in your face as needed...hopefully it would translate to world leaders too!
19 | Michael Kersey | Can't forgive nor forget that she and Obama abandoned those Americans then made up a lie to try and cover up. Trump will be be READY at 3 AM and any other time....and he will be SOBER and not on drugs.
20 | Jennie Guenzler | There is never enough time in these debates to thoroughly scour through all her crimes.  I truly hope that in the last one, Benghazi gets vetted. The four families of those patriots deserve that.
21 | Lauralee Paye | FINALLY.... THis needs to be brought up even More in VEGAS... Please Mr. Trump, have the families present of the lost loved ones of Benghazi and also Tig and the Guys who almost gave their lives trying to save them after the Stand Down order from OBAMA>
22 | Nancy Browning | For those that are in the Military, I am sure that they wouldn't want to be left on the battlefield to die in a foreign land for "political reasons" and then have their loved ones LIED to about what happened to their son, brother, father, and friend! 600 TIMES, not 6 times, 16 times, or 66 times, BUT 600 TIMES asking for help and received NONE! Think about that for a minute.....
23 | Linda Mccoy Bowman | I hope someone sees this HRC is always saying Trump needs to apologize. I have never heard her use the words I apologize are I'm sorry at any time, she will how ever say I shouldn't have done that or  it was a mistake, what difference does it make now. never has she uttered the two words she thinks everyone especially Donald Trump should use. Think About that.
24 | David Windisch | Why  has no one mentioned that in the spirit of the law , IRS offers tax relief for operating losses so the company will not go out of business. The last thing the IRS wants is to have a company fold. this is not a loophole, but instead a deliberate , well thought of solution to keep a company operational so future taxes and be collected.
25 | Sugar Azteca | Cocaine addict and completely irrational, yep he would make a great drug dealerr and nothing else.. Thank you Hillary for being the professional and lady you always are, you won the debate hands down. Dr.. Dean you were right.

Facts: Hillary let 4 men die in Benghazi, deleted 33,000 emails, shut up women's mouth after he raped them, she's not for women or children cause she's for abortion & rapists, she stands with terrorist, refugees, immigrants, thugs & racist, all for flag burnings, she accepts money from our enemies to get favors, she gives our enemies weapons, she won't say radical Islamic terrorism cause she & obama created them, she's been there for 30 yrs & has done nothing, she's a race baiter, she along with obama tells the black community they are victims when in reality they can do & be whatever they want! She wants to take our rights away along with our guns so their precious Isis can come & take whatever they want & kill whoever they want & sharia law would be in affect, Obamacare is a disaster... you can't afford it & you get penalized for not being able to afford it! Her & obama is not doing anything for our vets... clearly America is not first when obama & Hillary are in charge. Trump facts: he's a businessman, he has said "mean" things & I don't care about his taxes! Best part, he's not a politician! He wants to put up a wall, kill our enemies & he's for America! Americans will actually come first, vets will come first. Choice is clear! My choice is trump! #gotrump!!!
4 | Mike Dixon | I don't like both, but Trump won this debate. Like it or not thats the truth. Yahoo, Abc and NBC are now trying to save Hillary!üòÇ
5 | Jack Jenkins | Has Bill Clinton apologized for his vile and vulgar actions against women? He raped and molested women for real, actions speak louder than just words. Has Hillary apologized for threatening the lives of Bills women? It's interesting that the liberal media won't go into the Clintons past, they would only do it if the Clintons were republicans. This is just how corruption filled our media actually is.
6 | Jonna DePriest | Did you notice that both the moderators every time the audience would clap for Hillary  they never said anything  not to clap but every time they would clap for Donald Trump they would say we want to remind the audience to not clap because you're just wasting time. These moderators they pick are so bias.
7 | Mae Neisler | I say go for the jugler Donald, Clinton is a murderer, liar and traitor. We can't let her win...What he is accused of is so little compared to Clinton's lies about the murders in Benghazi and her lack of responsibility in those deaths to the families. We may not like Donald's demeanor but he is a stronger ally then Hillary..She is evil, pure and simple. God help us to be wise
8 | Paul Tucker | We've never had someone like him telling everyone all about this stuff and I personally believe it really scares ALL OF THEM to be honest even the Republicans who supported him (congress etc) they wanted him to step down not because of what he has said in a van but because what he knows and what we don't know
9 | Kirstien Demuth | Hillary should drop out of the race she's the biggest problem America has her and her buddy Obama
10 | Elisabeth Byrd | Because she takes other people's money and hoards her own. No one wants her money anyway because it has the blood of the soldiers who bravely died on her watch and the women and children who are systematically beaten, tortured and killed due to her "foundation's" contributions.
11 | Renee Stidman | Get ready Trump supporters....(copied)MARK MY WORDS."Over the next few days there will be woman sprouting out of the woodwork saying trump did sexually harass them by grabbing on them. I knew immediately due to Cooper being so vehement that Trump say for the record that he never did it. I doubt any of these accusations will be true they will almost surely be being paid through the Clinton foundation. Hillary is a blood thirsty beast and we all know this is exactly what she will do to win the election, especially since Trump vowed to have an unbiased prosecutor look into the emails which will land her in jail."

13 | Pat Warren | Her and her smirky snarly ugly faces. Tell me she doesn't have a mental condition. Donald was right on the money to bring some of Clinton's victims and have them sit in the front row. I don't know which was better that or telling her she would be in jail. He's a quick thinker
14 | Kevin Watts | You  know I've noticed past few weeks Hillary does not wear the American flag button on her. Everyone else wears it proudly. Just goes to show ya she is anti American!!! #Trump Pence2016
15 | Barry Holloway | HOW, in God's Green Earth, does someone in PUBLIC SERVICE, end up with $250 MILLION dollars in assets????? I would LOVE to get the name of the Clinton's broker, if you're going to say they invested???
16 | Pete Benton | Sorry Clinton, We're not buying it. You've had 30 years to prove your leadership and you have failed, miserably. As a matter of opinion, I know of no one who has failed worse and how you are the democratic candidate for the President of this country absolutely escapes me. I see a Trump win and your disappearing from American politics forever. Trump Pence 2016
17 | Richard Sealey | Exactly, Clinton's have made hundreds of millions off of selling America out and yet she can't fund one dime towards her own campaign ....Excellent point Mr. Trump
18 | Tommy Raines | Understand this , this is no threat this is a promise If this crooked elitist republican establishment doesn't stand behind Donald Trump 110% all the way to November 8th 2016 !! The we the people and the entire power that wields the Trump Train will be aimed directly at you and the party will be destroyed forever !!!You will finally with your tricks and backroom deals , midnite votes , finally be held accountable and cause the rise of a powerful third party !!! Just remember payback will begin as early as the midterms in two years!!! You are not just committing treason against trump but all his hundreds of millions of supporters !! #standbyyourmanDonaldJTrumporelse
19 | David Wright | She has never had to fund her own campaign, that's beneath her.  She uses special interest donors money and then gives them whatever they want.  That's always how she's run her political office.
20 | Hope Devenuto | It shows you how corrupt our government is by them allowing Hillary to run for office. She nor her party has any vision for this country. There only vision is to always deceive it's citizens. Wake up ladies and grow up for words can never harm you. Hillary has no substance. This is not about woman power if that's what swings you. It's about real issues on what has she done in 30 yrs. Why is she all of a sudden going to do something. If we mishandled trillions of dollars wouldn't we be fired from our positions? Why would you broadcast your war strategies so that your enemies know what you are doing? Also, is allowing illegal immigrants to vote fair to people who haven't been able to? Really? Frustration is what I and millions of others feel... Clean out the corruption in our government and the media. This debate was a knockout win and a great come back for Donalds campaign. In 30 yrs No one has ever put the Clinton's in their place from any Republican party. Powerful Donald Trump has and so needed to show that leadership is not about political correctness, but to be strong and respond in truth for its people, which evidently the media, the government nor hollywood has no interest in doing. They all rake it in to persuade you. and distract you from what is real. Kudos to the truth!
21 | Alona Weingarten | Why is she pooling the gender card, every time she feels uncomfortable? It's nice to demand equality and fairness for all but when it doesn't work, or actually when she is being treated equally, all of a sudden it's not fair because she is a woman? Give me a f$$king brake!!
22 | Manny Perez | This would be a very serious case of corruption. Where is the Judicial United States system on this? Why is Hillary not being investigated?Are you suggesting she was able to rig the whole system?If that is the case, we are in deep shi.....I just cannot believe Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama can control the whole judiciary system including FBI.
23 | Bonnie Lou Prunty Cline | Very true, Trump brought out the issues and facts that no one else had the guts to address!!! Trump/Pence to the White House or kiss our country good bye to ISIS and the New World Order that Hillary wants, and please don't forget about these innocent unborn babies, that Hillary and Kaine say have no Constitutional rights all the way up to the 36th week, they want legal to abort!!!!!!! God Help Us, she is the devil!!!!!!!
24 | Maureen Martin O'Neill | As a woman,mother and grandmother to girls,it sickens me to watch and listen to Hilliary Clinton. We are trying to teach our girls that rape and sexual assault is criminal and unacceptable,yet we have a candidate running for President,who  is married to a rapist and sympathizes with a religion  that degrades women and girls. Through her actions through the years,she is condoning these actions of her husband all in the name of power. What kind of example is this for our girls? Shame on all the politicans who withdrew your support for Trump,is this what you want for your children. The voters want change now, you had your chance and ignored us for years!!!
25 | Jim Finnegan | You are now cnn 2. Calling clintons woman that he raped accusers instead of victims is pathetic what would you rather have hillary and isis knocking on your door or loose your viewers. Ask rupert. Your pathetic!

1 | Michelle Scribellito | Do you complain about MILEY CIRUS, KIM KARTASHIAN, BEYONC√â, and so forth?  Oh that Schumer chick too...they degrade women as well.  Rap videos as well,  they are horrific!
2 | Joshua Willett | It's so true... illary is a p.o.s. Who is only interested in making her bank account as fat as possible... every president after they are out makes 400,000$ a year for the rest of their life's.... let's put a stop to it!
3 | William Garcia | At least he owns up to his mistakes and apologizes instead of blaming others for even digging it up. Ugly words, yes. But I am encouraged that he is surrounding himself with good men like Dr. Carson and Gov. Pence who are helping him become a better man, not just for our country, but for himself. I believe he has evolved even through this campaign. We are all a work in progress in God's eyes. Some may just be a little further along.
4 | Joy Tomasean | Who wants a rapist as First man in the WH ? It took a lot of courage for the victims of Bill Clinton to come out. Thank you ladies, I applaud you.
5 | Angela Szoyka | As a woman, I'd rather Donald Trump talk about groping me and make lewd comments, decrease my taxes and make me feel safe in my own home again rather than Hillary Clinton screw me royally, keep stealing from American women and increase the possibility of civil and foreign wars! I bet Donald has never talked about groping her ugly mug!
6 | Zakiya Moss | Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."

8 | Heather Gifford | "Actions speak louder than words. Mr. Trump might have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me. And Hillary Clinton threatened me.

9 | Tommie Lee | I wish Fox News would send Megyn Kelly to CNN or somewhere. She is not worthy to be a commentator on Fox News. Donald Trump did not say anything a million other men would say and that is not who he is today. Bill Clinton actually abused women and Hilliary trashed them. How could she trash Trump for what he said? I am a woman and a Christian and will still vote for him. Let you without sin cast the first stone.
10 | Vickie Brake Pollard | This is not the issue we need to focus on. He said something a decade ago that hurt no one. Focus on the actual issues of our country and not the shiny object the DNC is waving.
11 | Pete Benton | Sorry Clinton, We're not buying it. You've had 30 years to prove your leadership and you have failed, miserably. As a matter of opinion, I know of no one who has failed worse and how you are the democratic candidate for the President of this country absolutely escapes me.

12 | Carolyn Graziani | Hillary put the tape of Donald Trump to take the focus off the 2000 e-mails and it worked turned on Fox News and Fox Business this morning and they were still going on about what he said shame on them for climbing into the mud with her I am not watching them until they climb back out.
13 | Dan Davis | I'm sorry, but Johnson or Stein just don't stand a chance. Nowhere near enough support to do anything but take votes away from one of the major parties or the other. The sad truth is that we have 2 choices. One of them is an experienced career international politician who is a ruthless bulldog that will do whatever it takes to get what she wants done, right or wrong. She has been caught in one major false statement, and has had two major scandals, both of which she has been cleared of any wrongdoing. The other is a failed businessman with 6 bankruptcies, 5 failed businesses, over 150 pending fraud cases, one at the federal level, who at one point reported a $916 million dollar loss, and brags about not paying taxes for 20 years, who is also a proven racist (sued by New York Justice Court for racial discrimination), has publicly humiliated our military veterans, and says he knows more about ISIS than this country's Generals of the Armed Forces because he watches TV. He has on 3 recorded occasions expressed sexual interest in his own daughter, his current and 3rd wife can be seen naked on the internet by anyone with a browser, and he thinks Mexico is going to pay for a border wall between our two countries. Oh, and New York Justice Court has decided that there is enough evidence to move forward to a hearing on charges of JUVENILE RAPE, so he'll be facing those charges too. I think the choice, though it is not the choice we want, is crystal clear....
14 | Cortland Nagle | You should hear some things my girlfriends and I say at happy hour! Theyd make your ears bleed! But we are just messing around. Go Trump!
15 | Jg Wynn | ...and how many Rappers support Hillary?  Does she denounce the support of the "deplorables" who make millions of dollars from calling woman "bi___es...hoes"...ad nauseum and "rapping" much horrible things than Trump's locker room talk. More importantly the PROPAGATION of unspeakable treatment of women as being cool! C'mon Hillary let the American people hear you chastise them n shake your finger at them. Let us see you publicly shame them for publicly defiling the air waves as you privately support the "rappers" position on women!!!
16 | Ellen Fay Komorowski | Ok why is every so upset over what Trump said but not over Hillary's treatment of the women bill clinton had affairs with...and please what Trump said has been in movies ..books...songs I mean listen to some of the rap songs...and we buy ...see...listen..read  this stuff and yet we r offended by trump...Monica Lewinsky had a dress with bill s semen on it...come on people!! And who bought all the fifty shades books...and that is a story about women being submissive and yet we r offended...
17 | Charlotte Martin | He had to bring in Bill's accusers just to rattle her and that didn't even work lol! That is the only way he could perform in a debate after the last fiasco - how truly pathetic lololol!! He is jerry springer trash and she is Madame President. Loved every second. üòÇüòÇ
18 | Melissa Wanshon | LOL Fox,  you so funny. "despite his vulgar comments about women and extramarital sex." Oh, my goodness! Because NO man has ever done such a thing, ever, not in the history of the world! Seriously? Do you have your pink ruffled petticoats on today, Fox? Stop being over dramatic. Those stupid things men say are kind of like fish stories. None of it is *really* true, but they love to talk "sassy" with each other.
19 | Jack Jenkins | Trump said the word "pussy." Bill Clinton blew a load on an intern and Hillary called women liars bimbos and trailer trash.You be the judge
20 | Kristina Bullard | I love the people who say "but Bill is not running" so is actions as a rapist don't come into play as far as Hillarys presidential bid goes. Except for the fact he will be living in governmental housing, and just like Michell be present to meet and greet other leaders of the world, representing the US. So here's our presidents husband, he is a serial rapist, shake hands with him other First Ladies.
21 | Alex Bourne | Of course, because evangelicals will surely rejoice in a nation where they are free to grab women's p***y with no consequences. NOT!!!
22 | Linda Stillwell Ray | Thank you. I am concerned about the Shari law the Democrats are trying to pass, it will set Muslim religion above every other religion.It will make it a hate crime for anyone to question it. Why are Democrats not concerned that attack  Christians? The only people I've heard of being attacked are Christian's, white people or police officers.  It seems like the Muslim Church is using the Terrorists to change laws in America. If they don't like it here, why stay?
23 | Valerie DePasque Novak | Wow...you guys who support Trump don't  really think too highly of yourselves do you‚Ä¶it's a shame the high standards and values that used to be so prevalent in this country don't exist anymore..it's reached a new low..how embarrassing for us as a nation that many Americans are willing to put this bozo in office...
24 | Aaron Baird | Lets see- stand by trump who SAID something wrong or stand by the teflon twat who DID many wrongs? Seems pretty easy to figure out. If youre not a libtard, of course.
25 | Aida Berridy | If she is telling the truth for once about not knowing what the C meant, she is a bigger dingbat than we all think. She should not be allowed to even run for President. She has been a lawyer or should I say a liar.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Steve Borysiak | I believe lying under oath in a court of law is called "perjury," and Slick Willie was impeached for it. Hillary has been given a "free pass-get out of jail free" card, where her so-called husband, didn't.
2 | Jimmy Tucson | ..This is the truth of what is really at stake this election...We MUST elect Trump.https://amp.twimg.com/v/39fd2151-99b5-45f9-bdf8-173e0b7f3730
3 | Ronan Ryan | So the Congress supeoned her for her emails and she decided to delete... oh say, 33,000???? Didn't Nixon get booted and threatened with jail for erasing 19 minutes on a tape? She belongs in jail!
4 | Heath Stinson | We all already know the media is corrupt, let me ask, did you know Debbie Wasserman Schultz was the co-chair of Hillary's 2008 presidential run, where she lost the nomination to Obama. So, in order to lock down the nomination for 2016, Hillary would've had to put Schultz in charge of the DNC to manipulate the party from within. In order for this corruption scheme to work, the Clintons would have needed first to, not only get the current DNC chair at the time to step down, but also get them to recommend Schultz for the position. A big request. And the Clintons would have likely needed to promise a powerful favor to that DNC chair, something more prestigious than being head of the Democratic party. So who was that person and what did they get in return? The previous chair of the DNC prior to Debbie Wasserman Schultz was...Tim Kaine.Let that sink in.
5 | Ed Gilliam | I never thought in my lifetime I would be able to watch the Clintons...publicly face the bold truth about how despicable they really are; it was like watching a mini great white throne judgment. I Love it when Good "Trumps" Evil. Amen !!!
6 | Theresa Stubbe | I forgot nobody has said anything wrong or done anything wrong?  everybody in America has the cleanest a nobody has said anything wrong or done anything wrong everybody in America has the cleanest  record?     Like a lot of people are saying I'm not condoning what he said but guys are guys guys are always to talk like this and they always will I'm not saying that it's right but it happened over 10 years ago and nobody was really hurt in the process of it all guys make comments at a bar in a locker room in the car hanging out with the guys or guys make comments old guys talk about women like your a piece of meat it is been happening longer than we have been alive. And all the women that are getting all high-and-mighty on this is well you've never talked about grabbing a guy kissing a guy screwing a guy making out with a guy come on everyone needs to really take a good long hard look in the mirror we've all done it. Life Is Life, words are words, and I still think that there's still a big difference on what he said 10 years ago versus what Bill Clinton actually did the lies Hillary is spreading and the fact that she's not getting any kind of penalties for Benghazi or emails that she deleted they're not her own little private recipes they were high top classified secret emails that are gone and the people that stand in her way or going
7 | Hernan Senoren | Bill Clinton not running for president but it was Hillary who put these women lives in hell by legal means and harass by IRS while they are in power. She is clearly an enabler. She continues doing this while secretary of state to conduct illegal "Pay to Play" around the world.
8 | Henry Best | This woman is terrible, she will never accept responsibility for her actions, instead she either blame the Russians or the great Abraham Lincoln.
9 | Jay Camara | For those who think Trump won are sick after the release of the tape. I have had locker room talk before not in a way to sexuality assault a female. It's ok for forgive him for something he did 11 years ago but yet he still bringing Bill Clinton in this when he is not running. Republicans you are telling people its ok disgrace and disrespected your women as long as you use your faith.
10 | Pennie Brettin | Republicans just looking for an excuse to reject Trump. They are scared they are going to lose there place in the elitist club. Paul Ryan is a pussy and is worthless to us. Let Obama get away with everything. I would never vote for Pail Ryan. But I will be voting for Donald J Trump!
11 | Kenneth Neuendorf | I don't like the 2 but would take him over her.we need some one that is a saint to run for pres. and it will not happen.caues we all have something in the closet
12 | Bill Pineda | ~SFHow quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care.Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection.After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations.She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply.She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation.Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense.Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . .She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?)After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"Credit: Donna Bauerhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154832456506564&set=a.10153052941601564.1073741826.652821563&type=3&theater
13 | James Cannon | LOL, you people amaze me.  NY Times fact check: Trump is a liar...wake up idiots, he is pandering to you in hopes that there are enough people out there who think they will magically be better off with a guy who has stiffed the little guy, (and the little guy's wife if she's hot), at every opportunity. It would actually be fitting if Trump were elected because you would have to go on for four years blaming only yourself for your discontent.  Now go ahead, and change the subject and give me your "yeah but she did this or that" comment, which is based upon nothing but wishful thinking. Do you really believe that if there were anything she has done that rose to the level of prosecution, the GOP would not have done so as violently as possible?  Of course they would, they've been after her for years...but she's still standing, and beating your liar.
14 | Russ Abrams | Trump earned my deplorable retired Navy mans vote tonight with that jail comment. Finally someone who fight back against the Clinton corruption!
15 | Sandra Herron | Who would have ever thought that Donald Trump would become Bill and Hillary's worst nightmare. It can't get better than this.
16 | Jewel K. Christian | Hillary's free passes are over once we, the people, elect Donald J. Trump as our next president....a special prosecutor will indict her & all her corrupt government friends. didn't Hillary say "I don't recall" 39 times? Brain rot has set in & she is not fit to be president if her memory is that bad.
17 | Betty Springer Craig | She gets away with everything, just like Obama, and she is guilty. They are all under the power of Soros. We do not need her in office, because she will be worse than Obama,
18 | Gary Larrison | Why are people worried about lewd talk? That never has killed anyone, the blatant mis-handling of classified material that ISIS can use along with other 3rd world countries to harm our troops and Americans at large has and will continue....Hillary you will never be trusted whether you are President or not.
19 | Deb Hains | I'm afraid no matter what Trump does, he's going to be rigged out of this presidential election because of the upper  ,upper class of people the Clintons know. It won't matter how many votes he gets, the crooked gov. Of this country will do whatever they want to to not let him win .
20 | Elisabeth Bowers | This is why I despise her so much. She is not held accountable for things that other people would've been in jail for years ago. Yet she preaches against white privilege‚Ä¶
21 | Eric Staffin | Rudy doesn't understand the process here !  A) you have to lie at least 40 times before anyone notices, and, B) having a former President meeting with the AG before you consider a case resets the lie number back to 0.
22 | Karen Jenkins Korn | Did anyone else hear the spokesman for Hillary on Morning Joe say when asked "what do you say about her skirting the issue on the recordings where she said something totally different off camera???? His reply "IVE BEEn IN POLITICS FOR OVER 30 years, and that's the way politicians are, !!!!!  Exactly!!!!!!!! That's why we want them out!!!!!!!!!
23 | Cheryl Ogletree | Yeah Jason Jenson Stuart Morton she did lie. Saying she didn't recall, then later making millions on her memoirs (her memories). She only recalls if she makes money for remembering.
24 | Gene Moglia | Ok, so if Bill Clinton's transgressions led to his impeachment, how does the predatory tactics of Trump qualify him for president. Cognitive dissonance is alive and well with Trump supporters. Also, if Trump's going to put Hillary in jail, perhaps he should have taken up Mr Khan's offer of the US Constitution. Article 2 does not give the President the power to jail people and the 5th, 6th and 7th Amendments cover one's rights. Mr Trump cannot suspend these, any more than Mrs Clinton can repeal the 2nd Amendment, as he so often claims. Due process evidently means nothing to the mendacious misogynist Trump.
25 | Laura Baldwin | How many of the people who are commenting on Trump's statement about getting a special prosecutor actually watched and listened to the debate?If you did you either didn't pay attention or are unable to comprehend the English language. You are really embarrassing yourselves. It's seriously quite sad.
----------------Post:----------------
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the kind of locker room and frat house talk that personally infuriates me. But guess what? I still, without a doubt, support [Donald J. Trump]."

Watch Judge Jeanine Pirro's full opening statement.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Gary Greenwood | DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT : After what he went through this weekend. To come out with such strength and control. He has proven to me that he is ready to be President.
2 | Thom RudeBoy Chicomba | If Hillary & Supporters are so butthurt over something Trump said 11 yrs ago, then why would Clinton accept endorsements from "Rappers" who had said FAR Worse things about Women then Donald said in Private 11 yrs ago? Some of the Vile things said by these Musicians is so demeaning to Women but yet Clinton doesn't reject their Support?? Nor does Her Supporters?? Calling the Kettle black!!! Copied
3 | Wendy Geib | I'm a woman and NOT offended by locker room talk. It happens. Heck even us women have locker room talk. But what the clintons have done in the name of public service is criminal and as such, they both should be locked up!!!! With the key thrown away for life. THEN and only then, will the AMERICAN people and those women and families who have been hurt OR killed, get some closure from these 2.
4 | Walter C. Brown | Trump is a man with a vision for America, not a specific vision, a great vision...the best vision...Trump has a plan to make this country great again....What plan??....a great plan...a plan that will work because it's the best plan.....Why???... because Trump knows good people...which people???....the best people....people that are not stupid like other people....people who know how to get deals done...what deals???...great deals...the biggest deals... because I know words... What words???...I have the best words... I get my information from watching TV... I consult with myself because I have a great brain... A great brain???...the best brain...Trump will also build a big wall to keep Mexicans out and he will make Mexico pay for it!...How....??? its all part of the great plan!...ISIS will be gone very, very quickly...How???... I won't tell you.. It's a secret !!!...
5 | Chris Strange | Ok I broke down and listened to the recording of what Trump said all I can say is: Really all of this noise over this.? I heard worse then this in rap songs that people allow there kids to listen to. Fifty Shades of Grey was a hell of alot worse then this and there was over millions of copies sold and they made a movie out of it.
6 | Gary Greenwood | I'm not offended by Mr. Trump's comments, I don't know why any sane person would be. Inspite of Mr. Trump's crude comments in a private conversation 11 years ago, I stand behind his platform 100%. You're voting for the future of America, home of the free, or globalism, where our culture is gone, taken over, never to return. I do not approve of anything Hillary Clinton stands for and in no way want her for my President, destroying the country that I love. . If you don't support Trump/Pence and their platform then you are as guilty of America's ruination as Obama and Clinton. Hang tight people and don't jump off the Trump train!  If we went back on anyone currently in congress, I know we can find something that they did or said that would "offend" someone today. Let he who has not sinned cast the first stone.
7 | Frank Sapienza | They are only words this country is too politically correct.What about the actual abuse from the Clintons.Words vs real abuse.I take the verbal abuse any day.
8 | Christine Adams | Hillary has used far worse language towards men, especially men in uniform, or her aides. She mocked them, cursed them and denigrated them. She should also be ashamed of herself
9 | Tom McClerren | The Canadians we know are cheering for Trump. They don't realize if Clinton wins they lose their sovernty too. It will take 100 years to fix what her and Obama distroyed.
10 | Jay Chris | VOTE TRUe Military President!!! he did well in the debate last night:) KEEP PUSHING FOWARD TRUMP:)! you're getting used to it for being a beginner:) next debate you should be more comfortable to sweep the floor with Hillary!:) GOOD JOB MY FRIEND:)
11 | Alisha Hale | Someone explain to me how Hillary is going to do anything for women, when she stayed with a man, who used and abused other women, while in office?  What example does she really set for women in America, and more importantly for her daughter????  That does not say empowerment to me at all.
12 | Jeremy Porter | Remember, no one has disrespected women more than the Clintons. So much of what they've said and done has been swept under the rug but I'm thankful that Trump is calling Hillary out and calling her what she really is which is a liar!
13 | Julie Humphries | For those of you that may not know... Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on this man's writings and Obama wrote about him in his books.How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare ‚Äî Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty ‚Äî Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt ‚Äî Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control ‚Äî Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare ‚Äî Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education ‚Äî Take control of what people read and listen to ‚Äî take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion ‚Äî Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare ‚Äî Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?Never Hillary Please share
14 | Granny Norton | What Mr. Trump said in what he surely believed was a private conversation was lewd, rude, and crude. I, myself, have made many lewd, rude, and crude statements throughout my long life during conversations I, too, felt were private. I would be willing to wager that you have engaged in conversations you are not particularly proud of either, and, that you, too, believed were private. Neither Mr. Trump's words nor mine, hurt anyone's life. In my opinion, it is not that he said these things so much that is offensive to me, but that someone, somewhere, out there, in an act of desperation, decided to USE this private discussion, in order to attempt to derail a candidate that We, the People, in our hearts, believe is the answer to and perhaps an end to, the corruption which permeates the Government of America. You and all Republicans, are fully aware of the corruption at the highest level our country is being subjected to. I, personally think you are a fine young, man, Mr. Chaffetz, but I am disappointed that you are not wise to "dirty trick" politics, that played such a huge part of this entire, sordid attack on Mr. Trump. I am praying very hard, that We, the People, will prevail in this election. I regret that you are so easily swayed by Trump's words, and not the filthy words that run out of Mrs. Clinton's mouth like a water spigot whenever the microphones are turned off, and that you would even chance a single vote that might be cast for this despicable woman who wants to be leader of the free world.
15 | Cindy Dixon Collins | very articluate, expresses my views exactly....only thing I might ad is that just because some of us aren't as articulate as others doesn't mean we are incapable to doing great things...by this I mean Donald Trump may not be as articulate as Hillary (my feeling is that she is just too slick and smooth because of years of practice) but I believe he is more capable of running this country.  Thank You Judge Jeanine for speaking for those of us who can't.
16 | Zenaida Cabacaba Donovan | I couldn't agree more judge Jeanine! That was 11 years ago. No one is perfect but to compare his actions on that tape with Hillary's criminal behaviors is beyond me. Our national security is jeopardized with Hillary's poor judgment, criminal acts and lying in oath and with American people! I'm voting for Trump for the betterment of our country and my children's future!
17 | Teresa Branham | So let's all get this straight the words DONALD TRUMP said "made everyone mad. This was not rape, murder,lying,or hurting millions of Americans. Not only that it's o.k for terriost to kill Americans, it's o.k to dishonor our flag, it's o.k to dishonor our police and kill them,but it's not worth talking and standing up for. Americans are lied too .its all a plan ...WAKE UP everyone they are lying to us . We will be puppets if she is President.
18 | Natalie Sullivan | Trump, You did a great job of calling out the crooked politicians, Hillary the devil and the raper husband bill Clinton. Great job! I will still be voting for you! Saying some bad things as they say is no worse than 50 shades of grey that sold 80 million copy's of, or what is on our television shows, rap music and movies? What makes a future president hold to a higher standard of language or content? Last I heard there was freedom of speech in this country!
19 | Kathy Preston | Kevin, Trump never said he raped women. Get your facts straight. Donaldo, Hillary allowed the murder of 4 Americans in Benghazi, traded secrets for donations, lied about, well, everything, supported Muslim brotherhood, supports abortions, laughed about successfully defending a child rapist and more. You think she's more trustworthy to lead our country???!!!???. Blind, uneducated idiots.
20 | Danny Valdez | This election is being run in the mainstream media on a daily basis against Trump. No matter what he says or does they will give it a negative twist for all their sheep to see and hear on a 24/7 basis. Other than two TV media networks on cable the support for Trump by radio & TV media is extremely small. The mainstream media is making sure the masses are being exposed to every and all negative coverage of Trump on a literal 24/7 basis!!! Talk about a rigged system!!!
21 | Rita Jenne Ryan | I've been hearing these men feign horror over what Trump said 11 years ago. Claimed they'd NEVER heard that talk in a locker room. I asked my husband about locker room talk. He said that stuff goes on all the time and sometimes it's pretty bad.  He said when he was younger there's stuff he wished he hadn't said too. Go grow up people, quit pretending your virgin ears hasn't heard rough talk
22 | Mary Frith LeBlanc | I saw Mr. TRUMP's apology. You know what, it made me furious. Speechlessly mad. It has taken the last 12 hours to even find the words to share.Don't get me wrong I admire that he came at this thing head on and fast. He apologized, and did his best to turn the narrative back on to what is important. Saving America.But I just sat there listening and could feel the slow boil.ARE YOU KIDDING ME?A comment that he thought was private, spoken to a select group around him - ELEVEN YEARS AGO, as an ordinary citizen is now being used to disparage him?There is a vast distance, a great canyon, a chasm of biblical proportion between what one says off hand in private and what one stands behind a microphone, a podium and says to an audience. Or Congress. Or the Country. Or the world.So the media is going to hold Trumps feet to the fire over this while his opponent for the highest office in our country has disparaged blacks as super predators, TRUMP's supporters as deplorable, struggling young people as basement dwellers, Mexicans as taco bowls? Even calling her own constituents, the democrats stupid. She has been derogatory to the Secret Service, the police, and even to special needs children. She has laughed at getting a rapist off, and degraded, blackmailed and disparaged and tried to destroy and publicly humiliate how many women to protect her husbands reputation. She has even lied about the origins of her name.She has stood and lied to the American people, to congress and to the families of the dead in Benghazi. And then call them liars. Then lied about lying.She continues to lie about her health.Oh, and the sniper attack.And all of this from behind a podium or in front of broadcast cameras and reporters. To you.Her crimes are frankly to numerous to list and if you don't know them by know you are either deluding yourself or have been living in a cave the last thirty years and probably are not reading this post anyway.Where is her public accountability? Her public chastising? Her miea culpa?Crickets.So I sat watching a good man apologize for off the cuff remarks made in private, dug up and exposed for the singular purpose of embarrassment.Do you know what? It pisses me off. It focuses me on the absolute media bias, the absolute conspiratorial corruption we are dealing with. The very reason TRUMP is running, and as reinforcement to why thousands of us show up at his rallies to cry out for help. For change. For an end to the monopoly of liberalism that is attacking us at every turn.So if they think this action has harmed TRUMP, they are wrong. It has, at least for me, galvanized my support. It has tempered the steel edge of my disdain for their underhanded, cronyism.I hope you feel as I do.All I want to do now is to tell Mr. TRUMP to take off the gloves.I want to raise my voice and cry out to Mr. TRUMP that he no longer owes these people even a courtesy of decorum. Grab them by the ankles and haul them upside down and shake them until every skeleton, every despicable deed, every embarrassing moment is laid bare before the eyes of the world.Go for the jugular. Rip out the very heart of these people. Do not stop until they are dust and ash.Like the Phoenix of old, let America rise from this dust and the ashes of liberalism to become the Great country we were always destine to be.I want him to know we are with him. We stand with hammer and saw, muscle and force of will and arms ready to build, protect and defend our nation.Together we stand with him ready to Make America Great Again.God Bless Mr. TRUMP.God Bless You all.And, God Bless America.
23 | Sheri Musgrave | Here's the thing, it is locker room, frat house talk and lots of guys do it, including the ones people are saying "Not my husband, boyfriend, etc.".  Newsflash.... women do it and say things as well in regards to men and will even do it and say things about other women.
24 | Leonard Wong Chin San | I don't like what he said either. Look past that and see how much effort he has put in to the campaign reaching out to people personally using his own cash. He could just suck up to the present administration......he'd get more favors and wealth. He instead chose to make a stand and say "Things are wrong....let's make it right. " Right when no one dared to. However things turn out. I respect Trump greatly for this. The remarks...He is a man not a god. Remember this.
25 | Donald Boell | 1. Most guys do this; 2. When media and Hollywood bombard you with sex 24x7 what else might you expect?; 3. The holier than thou outrage is likely highest from people who love 50 Shades of Grey and who watch porn on their computers - its a way to make themselves feel better about their own guilt; 4. The mear thought that the country would elect a corrupt, sociopathic liar because of dirty talk boggles the mind. This shows how far the US has fallen. The country is SOL - time to move.
----------------Post:----------------
Debate question: Name one positive thing that you respect in one another.

Hillary Clinton: "I respect his children."

Donald J. Trump: "She doesn't quit, she doesn't give up. I respect that."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Leonard Wong Chin San | The question was about Trump. Not his children. Lacking in grey matter. She doesn't give up. Of course.... She's getting away with so much bribes and cash and no one is stopping her cover-ups. Why would she quit? Loved it when he said.... if elected he would investigate the private server issue. Probably the foundation too.
2 | Susan Watkins | She is a career politician and rule number 1 is ALWAYS talk about children if you are trying to get the woman's vote. To many women fall into this trap because of how they feel. Be more logical and you can see right thru her.
3 | Michelle Parisi | As a woman I think trump answered perfectly,  complimented her not her children ! His compliment was stating she's a strong willed women that says a lot about his respectful character
4 | Isaac Anim | Seriously! You want to talk about no judgement? You're all judging Trump over a PRIVATE CONVERSATION! How many times have you said naughty things about somebody or something while speaking with someone you trust? I know I've said a lot of things to my friends that I would hate to get out. Furthermore, Nobody should be commended. Bill raped; Hillary threatened the victims. It's not about love for them it's about power. If either one of them get convicted for their crimes they lose credibility and then power. They are not a goal you should set for a relationship. Trump was not my first pick. But I'd vote for a tube sock filled with poop and bullet ants before I voted for a criminal and a murderer.
5 | Laura Nieto | In my opinion Trump really showed that he doesn't have a bad heart at all. Hillary didn't want to name a single good thing about Trump and went around the bushes and only complemented his children to look nice. Trump could have done the same and call it a night, but he complimented Hillary and mention one trait he admires in her. He definitely gave the best answer and that question gave all of us a peek into their hearts.
6 | Melissa Kincaid | So she couldn't answer the question with a direct response.  Ok his children, but it didn't sound convincing, it didn't sound sincere.  When it sounds like she was trying to make herself believe that there is something about him she respects; yeah, not believable.
7 | Summer Lynn Gartland Ballance | This question shocked me but it was the best one of the night. There is so much negative so I liked that both were forced to see some positive.
8 | Brian Simmons | Donald won that debate hands down! He exposed the real Hillary and he did it brilliantly! I loved when he said if he were president she'd be in jail! lol He also said when he's president he's hiring a special prosecutor to go after her!
9 | Liberty Never Sleeps | Look, she can't even say anything nice about Trump, she said is half way about his children, and even took the time to take one last parting shot at him.
10 | Sunny Workman | Trump did the right thing. Hillarys response was lame and then she made it about her. Trumps response was brief but he kept it positive and about Hillary. Perfect way to answer.
11 | Annetta Schleupner | That's right Hillary he raised his children to be great young adult people and that's what he wants to do for the country you and Obama ruined... He wants to make it Great again!  I think she just shot herself in the foot or cut her own throat with those words.
12 | Carol Lovelace Wadley | She didn't answer the question. It was an opportunity to "go high" as she referenced and give a personal accolade and she couldn't go there. Says one thing and and again does another. Mr. Trump gave a personal and appropriate answer.
13 | Alyssa Beth Matthews | This was the best question of the night. A question in which tested both of their humility, their ability to remain humble. Sadly Hillary missed this completely. Many think her answer was nice, it wasn't. It was jab at him because she knows he didn't actually raise his kids full time. Trump was actually able to answer this question perfectly ! He was able to actually point out a good trait in his opponent in which he respected. And didn't continue on to boast  about himself afterward. I believe this question lost Hillary some votes.
14 | Jill Anne | Funny she says she respects his children. They are respectable people and their FATHER had much say in that. This only goes to prove that his " video" and the things he said have been said by 80% of all men in private. If we were to ALL be taped for ONE year, NONE of us would have any friends/family. We are all human and say things in the privacy of our " same sex acquaintances". Not excusing it, but my God....all you Saints out there!!!!!!
15 | Marie DiTullo | Oh, and I thought the funniest thing of all was the questions afterward when that one lady said "if that's locker room talk, we need a woman in office" ...... SERIOUSLY? .... is she that NAIVE???? where has she been for the last 100 yrs?!?
16 | Frank Walker | Clinton doesn't respect Trump. Did he do something to deserve that, besides of being her opponent ? No. So in the same way, she will disrespect Trump supporters, but only after the elections.
17 | Paul Johnson-Jovanovic | He missed a trick when she didn't put her hand out for a shake. He went to do so and she didn't want to know. He should have stuck his hand out anyway and if she'd declined it would have looked really poor.
18 | Peggy Fernandez Franco | Hillary couldn't say anything about him directly and then continued on to campaign mode.  Trump thanked her and said something about her personally and left it there.
19 | Emanuel Ifeanyi Gates | This line of statement proves Hillary, the bias media and all anti Trump machines wrong. This is a clear judgement for Trump in the faces of all these liberal defamations. Hillary gave the verdict. Through Donald kids you can understand the great man he is. üî® court!!! Dismiss.
20 | Carol Superdock Valk | Kudos to the moderators last night. While still lacking in their attempt to be unbiased, they did better than any we've had so far and kudos to Trump for continuing to point out the deficiencies in monitoring the clock and giving the candidates equal time.
21 | Elise Barnum Rabold | Notice, her compliment was not a direct compliment to him. It was back handed. He was able to compliment her directly. He was very gracious and a gentleman. She was spiteful. Another win for Donald Trump!
22 | Steven Hanchey | Donald trump is right why let the bad guys knows months in advance we gonna come bomb you. If your a civilian there you know what's happening get the hell out. Or they stay there cuase they support the bad guys. We letting all the bad guys get away . Surprise them that will have them all scared and not knowing what to do
23 | Samuel Chute | If i became president of the United States Donald Trump would be the one put in jail.For not paying any income taxes / For being a bullying moronic unstable lunatic who acts and talks more like Roman emperor Caligula tan someone running for president of the U.S.A. And for Trump's scamming of poor and middle class people who trusted in Donald Trump and paid the ultimate price of having Trump in return scamming them out of their hard earned money.And for Trump acting like, and being an accused rapist which in light of his spoken words and actions seem to have a lot of credibility. .Can you imagine this unstable buffoon Donald Trump as our President.World war 3 and nuclear weapons would be on the table, and entire cities would be blown off the map.Trump is not a rational man he is a paranoid monster unfit to hold the high office of President.This is a world in which our potential enemies have nuclear weapons.This maniac Donald Trump will be on Twitter bad mouthing someone while the nuclear weapons are coming down and pulverizing our country.Trump has all the characteristics of an Adolf Hitler and you all know what happened to Hitler.
24 | Warren Murray | The guy has had three wives and cheated on each with the next one, he refers to his daughter as a hot piece of meat? It shows that he didn't raise his daughter, the only attachment he has to women is his lust drive. His children didn't get their character from him, some parents are doing their children a favor by not raising them.
25 | Rory Mambo | You were right about Clinton last night when you had to say something nice...You said she doesn't quit and never gives up..well for the life of me I couldn't find anything that was nice but I know you meant "She doesn't quit LYING to the Country and she will never GIVE UP selling out our Country."

Donald J. Trump: "If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse - mine are words and his was action." #Debates2016 #FoxNews2016
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jennifer Jackson Doolity | Hillary keeps that creepy smile on her face trying to hide her reactions to the truth! That creepy smile was knocked off her face tonight! Tonight Trump talked about the ISSUES and rattled ALL 3 of the idiots he was up against! Good for him!
2 | Jacob Shuman | MARK MY WORDS.Over the next few days there will be woman sprouting out of the woodwork saying trump did sexually harass them by grabbing on them. I knew immediately due to Cooper being so vehement that Trump say for the record that he never did it. I doubt any of these accusations will be true they will almost surely be being paid through the Clinton foundation. Hillary is a blood thirsty beast and we all know this is exactly what she will do to win the election, especially since Trump vowed to have an unbiased prosecutor look into the emails which will land her in jail
3 | Christy Bogan | We want change. Hillary claims to love children and is for killing babies right before they are born! We want our nations laws upheld. 11 million illegals live here and they do nothing about it. I could go on and on. No more Bill Clinton in Whitehouse messing with ladies. He shouldn't be aloud to even live there!!! He was disbarred and impeached. Good grief!!!
4 | Frank Miechur | Wow do you want to put an old tired impeached sexual predator XPresident back in the WH as First Predator with lots of influence for Foreign Powers???? Is this what you want????????? GO TRUMP!!!!!!!!!
5 | Elaine Torres Feinblum | Why haven't I seen anyone state that Donald Trump was a gentleman when he waited to see if Hillary Clinton would extend her hand and she did not. It is etiquette for a man to wait for the woman to extend her hand. In the end, I'm proud that he decided to break with etiquette and was the one that extended his hand to her, but I have not seen anyone state that he was a gentleman doing so.
6 | Ken A. Rathman | They showed Bills face a couple of times and he looked a little sick! How come Bill Cosby is facing charges now after so many years but, Bill Clinton is not?
7 | Janet Olafsson | notice how Killary wasn't listening‚Ä¶..they don't live together. she in NY and he in a penthouse above his library. she could care less about BILLY
8 | Kym Gumuna | I don't agree with his comment he made eleven years ago but he nailed this. Hilary wants to bring up the past well she's just dragging Bill Clinton down in this just for more votes.
9 | Cheryl Conway Oettle | Fox why are you so enamored with Megyn Kelly? I would love to continue to watch the talk after the debate but you always put her on & I have to turn the channel to CNN. By the way, she would be a much better fit for them with her obvious hatred of Trump. #dumpmegyn
10 | Kings Ibe | Donald Trump is who America needs at this sensitive period. He says it the way it is. I kept wondering how Hillary could be living in the same house with Bill Clinton(a rapist) and that makes her accomplice to all he has committed. I have never heard her condemn Bill Clinton for once nor has she apologized for what Bill Clinton did to girl children because she is his wife and a woman too..
11 | David Jones | Trump Cruuuuuuuuushed Clinton on every ISSUE including her Rapeist husband...The media will do what they do.. try to make thier opinion matter ..Doesnt work anymore.....Go Trump !!!!!
12 | Brian Calvert | She looks embarrassed. But hey, she decided to take it this far.  Trump fights back!!  He's not like the other weak candidates like Romney.
13 | Lisa Ann | Finally said!!When will people realize Trump is not a double talking politician- just a strategic thinking businessman- yes a MAN- complete with some flaws- but flaws that are not as destructive as THE CLINTON FOUNDATION
14 | Christina Sunshine | Alex Jones has already predicted that in a few days Hillary will have 3 woman coming out saying Donald Trump was sexually abusive to them and or raped them. Don't let yourself be a part of the Sheep, brainwashed by the Media. Bill Clinton and Killary should both be in Jail! #Trump2016
15 | Margaret Mokry Tomlin | I know it's too late, but I vote to bring back the independent timekeepers and with the bell also.  Moderators should not be allowed to act as their own timekeepers.  I saw a digital clock on a wall maybe one time and it was at zero and Hillary was still allowed to drone on as usual.  Bring back the bell and clock so the viewers can see it at all times!
16 | John Perry | The Apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Hillary atest to Trumps great character by his children and the way they turned out! Not matter how much we invest...no matter how much we try.....all parents in America can agree, its not easy to raise respectable sucessful children. If Trump were a horrible man his kids wouldnt be like they are.
17 | Emmanuel Ifeanyichi-ukwu Ogbonnaya Edeh | Rapist Bill want to come back as president, through the back door, the wife, killery, i love Trump so much,he is fighting for Americans, against obama third coming,muslim brotherhood/isis,Bill the rapist,second coming,special interests and bad politicians. #voteTrumpPence2016
18 | Linda Pounds | Home run of the night... IMHO Trump says he'll hire a special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute her for all her lies to the American people. While still wasn't the candidate I wanted as a president but that alone is worth my vote.
19 | Doreen McAlister | Wow! When's  Megan Kelley moving to CNN ? I think she would be a good fit. You could see hate coming out of her eyes . Professionalism definitely out the door.
20 | Tim Mccorry | Who is picking these bonehead moderators ??They definitely exposed their bias !!!lolAmericans are sick of crap just like this, democrats trying to rig everything with medias help. NOT THIS TIME !!!!!
21 | Oliver Goodale | -Hillary Clinton goes under FBI investigation. She blatantly lies, saying she never handled any classified material through her private server-President Obama endorses Hillary Clinton-Bill Clinton secretly meets with U.S. Attorney General-Attorney General blatantly lies to our faces, saying their conversation consisted of "grandchildren and golf"-President Obama and Hillary Clinton fly around together on Air Force One to go and campaign for Hillary on the day of the FBI verdict-FBI lays out Hillary Clinton's reckless and negligent behavior, concludes she did handle classified and top secret material & does not know whether or not the server had been hacked -FBI brings no chargesThe fix is in, folks.
22 | Niko Serafini | Anytime someone is hurt over the words of something trump said look at the actions of the Clinton's everything from lies and cheating to murder an stealing.
23 | Chris Robbins | Because he did not kill anyone in Benghazi, he did not try to silence those who were raped by Bill Clinton, he does not have over 40 people who knew some incriminating evidence commit suicide, nor does he have a private email server that contained highly classified information and is not even pursued for justice! That is vile a disgusting, maybe a little more history on Hillary and her foul mouth would help!
24 | Joseph Ayegba | The demolition of Hillary and their co-travellers media CNN and Yahoo. What a way to emberass and expose the media bias stocked against Donald J. Trump
25 | Yossi Kainan | All the way from Israel, just so you know %80 of us wishing Trump will win! and %80 of the American isrealy how vote like me, will vote Trump! It's ashamed that most Jews in America don't see it! Like with Obama and many more! And %80 of them will still vote for the wich!Sham on you American Jews!Doron Mizrahi agree with me! So do Izak Rozin and Maxime Elbaz with his son Eric Elbaz!

President Obama reacted to the video of Donald J. Trump making vulgar comments about women. He said Trump's comments show he is "insecure."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Gavin Beckendorf | Funny, never heard him react to bill Clinton's rapes and assaults
2 | Shane Daniels | After 8 years of his failed policies, I couldn't give two shits what Obama has to say.
3 | Jorge Argudo | What did He say about former president Bill Clinton's actions? and Hillary Clinton's support for Juanita Raddrick, Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky...Glad these women were present and they were heard by the American Public. Disgraceful.
4 | John Dugan | Iran backed group fired 2 missiles at a U.S. Destroyer off the coast of Yemen - Thank you Obama -- and we really care about what you think about Donald Trump, not at all Obama. You were not qualified and neither is Hillary.
5 | Colleen Leigh McQueary | Most of us with more than a pea brain are much more bothered by what Killary, her husband and you have done...than by what Trump has ever said!! Actions speak so much louder than any words!!!
6 | Michelle May | What about the video of you talking about eating ribs and eating pu$%y? Anything to say about that sir???
7 | Mark Teresa Purichia Stinnett | Should he be worrying about our ship that was fired on by his buddies from Iran , might want to move it up on your priority list fool
8 | Scott Christensen | How can Obama possibly talk negatively about Trump without saying a word about Hillary's character? Anything he says is just to further the Democratic party and get Hillary elected. He can say the same thing about Hillary. Is being a liar, like Hillary, a good trait to have in the Oval Office?
9 | Jeff Stone | Don't we have more important things to talk about right now. Like getting everyone in the south some relief. It's called prioritization.
10 | Keely Ryan | They're trying to milk this stuff for all it's worth, or not worth. This pushing and low balling is only making them look like the dirty, greedy, crooks they are.
11 | Vaibhav Lahoti | I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump.  The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he might talk  rude to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians , the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is Weak, Bankrupt, our Enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."GOD help America if hillary gets in.
12 | Tami Alford | Seems he and Hillary always fall back on "the children" to push most of their agenda. If they are so concerned about "the children" then why do they support abortion?
13 | Jarrett Cook | I remember when Obama was runing in 2008 he called Sarah Palin a pig with lip stick nobody didn't say anything about that.
14 | Debbie Davidson | people need to open their eyes! Hillary allowed men in Benghazi to be slaughtered and Nixon was impeached for far less than what Hillary has done. Health care that's a joke. I needed surgery and had to come up with the first 6000.00 and we have one of the better insurance companies. Taxes, it doesn't pay to work overtime cause it all goes to taxes and she wants to raise it. I used to be middle class now we are in the lower class cause with two of us working we still make under the 100 thousand mark. People wake up. Trump may not be a politician but he is far better than a liar and self centered politician who only cares about what she can do for herself.
15 | Joseph C. Eyzaguirre | So let me get this straight... Bill Clinton had an affair with an intern, fathered a baby (possibly more than one) and abandoned him. Hillary defended a child rapist and Bill Clinton knowing that he sexually assulted all those women, had people killed in Benghazi, deleted 33k emails on a private server, systematically created and armed ISIS, had 6 billion dollars unaccounted for as Secretary of State. And the media doesn't care. Donald Trump said something 11 years ago in a "locker room conversation" and the media is now going crazy. The hypocrisy is astounding!#AmericaStandsWithTrump #TrumpPence2016
16 | Kristin Terborg | Sadly Obama hangs out with an impeached President who has been accused of rape. He has no area to speak on trumps words and not Bill Clinton's actions.
17 | Patricia Pearson | There is a video of Obama out there in internet land saying some of the exact same "p" words Trump did. And America is done with Obama, we have 102 days until Trump takes up office at the WH. It can't get here soon enough!
18 | Jon Smith | Hillary and Obama purposely sold out this nation, ran up our debt and tried to destroy this nation, and Trump lacks values?
19 | Gerry Aguire | And you're endorsing a corrupt lying criminal witch! Can't wait for Jan 20th when Trump throw this trash out of the White House!
20 | Dee-Dee Orr | Dems are so offended of women being mistreated. Yet are willing to place impeached disbarred Bill, her BETTER HALF back in the White House to continue his perversion.  Smh
21 | Corressa Huntsman | 18 people just died from Hurricane Mathew, but you are worried about criticizing Trump?Don't worry Obama, Trump will clean up your mess!!
22 | Charles P Ringling | Funny, Obama has been putting down people for years. White people, rich people, foreign governments, republicans, conservatives, christians, the media, etc and the rest he also just let down.
23 | Granny Norton | The most arrogant President ever, attempting to interfere with the election, commanding a Justice Department, providing immunities to nearly all those involved in Secretary Clinton's EMAIL SCANDAL. A President who heard all the things the Director of the FBI told us about Hillary Clinton, that she was extremely careless and reckless with our Nation's classified materials, who did not immediately come to the microphone and speak to America about this.  A President, who sought not to assure a nation, but remained silent as there were no prosecutions, when all Americans knew that anyone else in similar circumstances would certainly have stringent consequences, the very least of which would be to forever lose the privilege of being privy to America's secrets.  A President, who learned that his Attorney General held a private meeting with the FBI target's husband (a former President) and potential witness only hours before a decision was to be made in these investigations. A President who is aware that sensitive materials belonging to the United States Government, were destroyed following a Congressional Subpoena to produce them, and remains silent.  A President who has lied to us about the OBVIOUS ransom payment made to a country we know will spend every cent of what we provided to them in efforts to HURT AMERICA and her citizens.  I find it absolutely reprehensible that our President, who is supposed to be a voice for WE THE PEOPLE, clears his calendar of duties he is being paid to do, in order to further smear a candidate running for president, because it may affect his own, pitiful legacy, in favor of Hillary Clinton, who could not pass a security clearance test to operate a laundromat, but wants to put this person in the White House as his replacement, only because he wants to preserve his own legacy.  This, folks, is what INSECURITY is all about.
24 | Mike Perez | And he didn't say anything about him referring to not living in a "goddamned desert", or not giving up the "ribs", or "the pussy"??? I seem to recall him reading those passages from his book to a Cambridge Library group around 1995 or so.  Seems like Trump may not be the ONLY man in the world to use that term...Hypocritical much Barack???
25 | Dan Graiber | Not as bad as Bill Clinton saying to the American people he didn't have sexual relations with any of the many women while being president, and none of them were chastity belt Hitlery.
----------------Post:----------------
"I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. It's with him, and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run."

Hillary Clinton responded to calling half of Donald J. Trump's supporters a "basket of deplorables."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Brad Brower | It didn't matter what Killary had said after Donald simply stated "because you would be in jail" that ended her entire night right then & there. Job well done mr trump . 3 v 1 & you still destroyed her.
2 | Brenda Kaye Harrell | She and Obummer have been the dividers in chief. Funny how she always quotes "If they go low we go high" when her campaign has gone the lowest of the low.  Never high.
3 | Woodrow Loyd Siupapa Melesio-Vaovasa | the way she keeps looking about not making eye contact looking to the ground typical signs of a liar....looks like the liberals attempt to bury Trump may have back fired....YOU AREN'T SORRY, YOU'RE SORRY YOU GOT CAUGHT....YOU CRIMINAL
4 | Chris Ruiz | I had the privilege of seeing the debate both in english then in spanish much was lost in the translation and at times when Donald spoke THE TRANSLATER he did not repeat the same in SPANISH and at times said nothing...all over spanish news not only said the killsry won but big...BS...many Hispanics that know english and some that sat with me during the debate even noticed with the little understanding of english at times commented that is not what Donald said and some of them weren¬¥t even supporters of Trump but noticed that news in spanish about Donald in fact is misleading and at times even a lie....HISPANICS for TRUMP..PLEASE SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS.
5 | Romeo StPierre | I try to keep my political views to myself. But really I can't do that any longer! I see America slipping away! I'm not a republican or a democrat. I am an American, not a white one, not a black one. or a hispanic one, or a native american one, or any others that make up our great nation. Donald Trump is really not a republican he is a Nationalist. He believes in America! He's not a politician! He's a rich guy that could have continued to make money like the other leaches in the political system, but he decided this country means something! He's fighting the republican party elites that don't like him and the media who has never found a democrat that they didn't love or worship! Just look back at all those Kennedy family scandals what great examples of morality they are. If we make the right decision this time we will be on the road to a Republic once again! The founding fathers said we have established a Republic are we smart enough to keep it!  George Washington said political parties will be the death of us. How true that is today! If you elect Donald Trump maybe this time, just maybe, people like Joe the Plummer and others might have a chance to lead this great nation. I don‚Äôt think the founding fathers believe in the good old boys network running the country. They were smarter than the politicians of today! So when you go out to vote remember that our country is at stake! I pray you all make the right choice. God help us all!
6 | Ron McClellan | ""I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that . . "Funny, Trump said the same thing . . .why is that valid for you and not Donald? And sorry Hillary, you didn't call 20-something percent (minimum) of ALL REGISTERED VOTERS "deplorables" 11 years ago.
7 | John Williams | "You have to have a public and a private position." How much more plainly and openly can she admit that she lies to the American people at every turn and that she thinks that it's perfectly OK and normal?! She is a congenital liar and has now openly admitted it! Only the most ignorant, uninformed sycophant could now actually vote for her.
8 | Diana Von H | Most people who've gone through and done what she's gone through and done, would have the decency to never show their faces in public again. She's been caught in so many lies and border-line criminal acts, that it's like she doesn't even bother to try to hide them anymore. That she is continuing this farce proves that she is not a real human, that there is something fundamentally, biologically and completely broken inside that makes her (it?) both deplorable and irredeemable.
9 | Kenji Otto | Any "man" that says, "I've never talked that way about women." IS either a LIAR or GAY, if gay they have talked that way about other men!You women who are offended by this talk are either prudes or hypocrites.There is not that many prudes in America!If your a millennial female your a hypocrite, I have two 20 year old daughters. Walking through the school I heard worse from teenage girls that shocked my military experience.I've heard Catholic school girls talk worse.Donald Trump great job!
10 | Timothy Bolton | "And I'm proud to be a deplorable, where at least I know I'm free!I won't forget the lies she toldShe told them right to me And I gladly stand upAgainst this broad and despise her to this day!There ain't no doubt I love this land,God bless the USA!!!!"
11 | Ethel Wishnia-liss | Has anyone noticed that the 2 debaters are not standing behind podiums but have high stools that they might be able to rest when the other is speaking.....tell me is this format now being used because of Hillary's health problems....just asking???????????
12 | Angela Su | Please stop putting on Megan Kelly on after debate spin room program. She's VERY biased towards Trump and had all the people that hate Trump on, including Juan Williams. I had to turn off TV and wait for Sean Hannity to be on, as there's no channel I can stand that are not trashing Trump no matter how did Trump do. So, no Megan PLEASE!
13 | Barbara Scribner | Moderators - Hillary apologized let's move on. Trump apologized lets beat him up with his own words. The RNC is spineless to accept these venues for  their candidates. They need to demand one conservative moderator to offset the liberal.
14 | Ray Wyberski | I didn't call anyone deplorable, I didn't say I want to get rid of all the coal miners, I didn't say I will raise the taxes on the middle class, I didn't delete any e-mails, I wasn't sleeping during Benghazi, I didn't say Bernie Sanders supporters are basement dwellers, I didn't say that black people are ‚Äúprofessional never-do-wells‚Äù incapable of success irrespective of the opportunities they‚Äôre given, etc. Clinton for President, what a joke and lier.
15 | Jim Tracey Hildreth | Did Hillary ever apologize to those women Bill Clinton raped and then she destroyed their life as if it was their fault. How about the 12 year old rape victim? She could have told her she felt terrible what had happen to her years ago and she was sorry and hope that she has been able to move forward and she was Sorry! But she ignored those women after what she did to all of them! But Trump treats women badly but I guess she and Bill are aloud to.
16 | DonAndre Ortiz Orpilla | Copied from another post .....some things forgotten. How quickly we forget!  If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten.  If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
17 | Karen Hale | SEX AND THE CITY....Anyone ever think about the cult like following of this show? Do they remember the way the characters spoke openly about men and women....their bodies...positions...every possible fetish from shoes to baby talking during sex....man....what hypocrites....Trumps words were never meant to be heard and yet look what's said on TV!!!
18 | Betsy Mills Panek | Lying again, don't remember any sincere apology. Hypocrite, with her help our Country has become a train wreck. It's her way or the highway or should I say, the graveyard.The liberals have created more extreme hate and divisiveness in 8 years than I can remember.They will be creating more drama very quickly because the Elite and their puppet liberals are freaking out.BTW those "rebels" our president and Kerry are arming are none other than Al-Nusra akaAl-Quaeda aka ISIS,Which translate to Treason. Providing Arms or aid to the enemy is Treason. Just wondering why no one says a thing about that.
19 | Roger De Backer | So, if she becomes president and she has an argument with Assad, with which she is bound to have an argument, she will call the Russians  basket of deplorables. Yeap, that  is going to smoothen international relationships and qualifies her for the White House. I think I prefer Trump and his special prosecutor.
20 | Sandy Aina-Saulo | Hilary Clinton will become the next POTUS and do you want to know why? Because they are going to start putting Syrian Refugees on the plane this week and bring them in as quick as possible so they can vote... oh by the way I'm still voting for Trump even though they are going to cheat him
21 | Fern Hyams Reisner | Really Hillary? Are we Deplorable because we have got your number? Loved Donald"s Jail response. He said what we common people are thinking. She is full of herself, and has gotten away with stuff the rest of us would be spending our life in jail for doing. She thinks that she invincible.
22 | Ivy Cifizzari | She called Blacks super predators, too, and refused to address this name calling when asked by a Black woman in recent months at one of her private speeches. It may have been at the Treyvon Matin Foundation (?) She has NEVER apologized for her racist and bigoted statements. The same thing occured when Hillary was confronted at a NH rally by a rape survivor and questions were posed about Bill raping women and she called the rape victim "You are very rude and I am not going to call upon you again" and swiftly moved on to the next question from another member of the audience. Hillary Clinton didnt acknowledge Bill Clinton's rapes or his victims last night, either.
23 | Kathleen Hagen | This is just one example of Hillary's narcissistic projection.  She falsely accuses other people of what She is doing herself.  It is a window into her cold, heartless soul.  It is a classic element of Her pathology.
24 | Theresa Lockwood | The difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is that Hillary Clinton speaks a lot of hypocrisy and blames others of what she herself is doing...Everything she says and condemns..she herself is has done and is doing. Trump has admitted his wrong honestly and apologized...Hillary Clinton still rants off with lies and wants him to apologize for things he has not done...while SHE IS the vilifyer in those claims. NOT TRUMP! Hillary Clinton is a degenerate wh0re and still protects her serial r@pist husband who she has att@cked his victims instead of her husband. Nothing Trump said is a l!e...and Hillary Clinton has r@ce baited annd blames Trump for bullying..and she and Obama has done nothing but incite violence and bully...they use nothing but l!es to promote their propaganda...and accuse others(even Trump) of what they themselves are doing. STOP THE MIND R@PE Hillary Clinton and Obama. Hillary Clinton has promoted the agenda of Obama...simply because Hillary is a pet of Obama as she has clearly expressed.
25 | Yvette Richard Dyson | I am so sick of the way politics is today. It doesn't seem to matter what the country needs, what the American people need, or how we look in the eyes of other countries.It seems that it is all about who can dig up the most personal dirt on who. Well, in my opinion, we all have skeletons and spiders in our closets. If you want to disqualify someone on something they said or did, you are all guilty of something. Actually, we wouldn't have anyone who is acceptable for any public office. NOT EVEN YOU!!What we need to look at is, how the "dirt" affects the things that are important to the country and it's people. That being said, I personally feel that the things we are seeing with Hillary Clinton's e-mail scandal, her unsecured private server, and all the questionable conduct of the FBI and the Justice Department and Obama's possible involvement, along with controversial remarks made in speeches to Wall Street and the exorbitant amounts paid for these speeches as well as the controversy around the Clinton Foundation make her more risky for the country. These things affect the safety and security of our country and our families and these were not things that were done ten or twenty years ago, these are things she has done in the last eight years, during Obama's administration, two terms in which she was trying for the presidency herself.The locker room language of Donald Trump may be offensive to many people, but it in no way puts our country and the safety and security of it's people at risk. I am a woman, and I don't like that kind of language, but he said nothing that 90% of men don't say amongst themselves everyday. Many may not agree with me, but in light of how far they had to dig and what little they dug up, I cannot vote for anyone but Donald Trump.The most important thing in this election, in light of ISIS, the current corruption in our government and the influx of refugees and illegals that we can't control, as well as the riots associated with BLM, is our safety and security. In my opinion from what I have seen the greatest risk to our security and safety is Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.MY VOTE WILL ONLY BE FOR TRUMP/PENCE.

"She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name. But the name is there. It's 'radical Islamic terror.'"

Donald J. Trump said that "whether we like it or not there is a problem" with Islamic terror, and if you don't say the name, you cannot defeat it.

1 | Jerome John | The media is going bonanza over this debate. Trump killed it and they couldn't save Hillary.
2 | Sam Figura | Trump killed it. Her antithesis usually rambled on, and she couldn't find ways out of those traps. Interesting how the next debate will turn out!
3 | Travis Carter | EVERYONE is either in the clintons back pocket or theyre scared of being murdered,rigged debate,2 liberal, clinton loving ,asstard moderators,AND HE STILL WON..Thats the kind of president i want..
4 | Joni Bunch | Boom! Mike drop! Trump K.O her butt! He was awesome tonight. Evil will not win! Media can throw everything at him cause they are running scared & they are losers! Facts: Hillary let 4 men die in Benghazi, deleted 33,000 emails, shut up women's mouth after he raped them, she's not for women or children cause she's for abortion & rapists, she stands with terrorist, refugees, immigrants, thugs & racist, all for flag burnings, she accepts money from our enemies to get favors, she gives our enemies weapons, she won't say radical Islamic terrorism cause she & obama created them, she's been there for 30 yrs & has done nothing, she's a race baiter, she along with obama tells the black community they are victims when in reality they can do & be whatever they want! She wants to take our rights away along with our guns so their precious Isis can come & take whatever they want & kill whoever they want & sharia law would be in affect, Obamacare is a disaster... you can't afford it & you get penalized for not being able to afford it! Her & obama is not doing anything for our vets... clearly America is not first when obama & Hillary are in charge. Trump facts: he's a businessman, he has said "mean" things & I don't care about his taxes! Best part, he's not a politician! He wants to put up a wall, kill our enemies & he's for America! Americans will actually come first, vets will come first. Choice is clear! My choice is trump! #gotrump!!!

We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."DONALD TRUMP has my vote. NOTHING he ever said even slightly compares to the immoral, vile, corrupt ACTIONS of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Trump said some lewd WORDS, while Bill CLinton has actually RAPED, SEXUALLY ASSAULTED, and EXPOSED him self to women multiple times! Look it up, there are actual police reports. Hillary Clinton has defended a child rapist who Brutally raped a 12 year old girl (kathy shelton) put her in a coma, and Hillary got him off FREE, she admitted she knew he was guilty, and laughed about it!LOOK AT ALL YOU 'MORALLY SUPERIOR' FOLKS CASTING STONES. TRUMP is BY FAR the BETTER CHOICE.
9 | Humberto Flores | HILLARY CLINTON: It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country."DONALD TRUMP: "Because you would be in jail."
10 | Michael Montgomery | I know it's almost 3 am an Hillary will get upset but trump reminds me of Dead Pool some may not like his looks an some may not like the way he talks or his actions but everyone has to admit they like what he stands for and his results
11 | Norma Pickford | Trump‚Äôs comment will go down in History! Lady Astor ‚ÄúIf I was your wife, I would poison your tea" to which Winston Churchill replied ‚ÄúMadam, if I was your husband, I would drink it!‚ÄùTrump over Clinton‚Äôs private email server, saying: "You ought to be ashamed of yourself." Clinton weakly replied, "You know it‚Äôs just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in this country.‚Äù To which Trump brilliantly replied: ‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôd be in jail.‚Äù
12 | Carlos Salazar | Did anyone notice she replied to ever  statement Trump made. Or questioned about her. But she. 100% skipped the things on her husband and the payoff and the accusations, or what she did to these woman's lives for what her husband chose to do with them.
13 | Vitor Pereira | STUDENT: Sir, can I ask a question?TEACHER: Yes!STUDENT: How do you put an elephant inside a fridge?TEACHER: I don't know.STUDENT: It's easy, you just open the fridge and put it in. I have another question!TEACHER: Ok, ask.STUDENT: How to put a donkey inside the fridge?TEACHER: It's easy, you just open the fridge and put it in.STUDENT: No sir, You just open the fridge take out the elephant and put it in.TEACHER: Ooh...ok!!STUDENT: Let me ask another one.

14 | Mark Gruici | so what is going on at Fox. I can barely stand to watch anyone except O'Reilly and Hannity anymore. Have you all sold out to the dems. Could you suck up to Hillary any harder. Hopefully Wallace will do a better job but I doubt it. I am sure we will here more stupid B.S. about trash talkin on the stern show and what Trump has to say about girls self body image.rome is burning and this is what we get.? Americans should be so angry w/all of the so called journalists and especially w/Hillary and her lies. And we Trump supporters are called deplorable. This is what we have people, snakes , vipers and criminals in D.C. and more of the same on all media channels. A bunch of made up, beutiful, lying snakes. I can't even watch Meygan Kelly for fear that I will throw a brick through the television and we all sit and watch. what is everyone going to do when all of these lying snakes tell us Hillary wins. Think about it.
15 | Millie Oliveros | Clinton is in for a Big surprise many people who never go on Facebook or tweet will be voting for Trump or anyone but her. This are the people who will keep her away from the White house. People keep it quite because they don't want to be judged! God bless the USA!
16 | Tommy Kryka | Try as they might, but the liberal media could not put ol Hillary back together again .... After Trump spanked the heck out of her!!!!
17 | James G. Fulks | If Trump wins the RINOS will go along with the Democrats like they have always done and there will be two more years of getting nothing done. All and I mean all of these Liberal jerks, the Marxist Democrats and the Liberal Republicans need to be voted out. BUT I fear the fix is in once again for Hillary. If the Republicans will not work with Trump, then they may create a monster because he will fight back.
18 | Osiris Ramm | Put a stake in Hillary, nail up the coffin and bury it in concrete. Sprinkle a little bit of holy water while they are at it. She's done for
19 | David Z√∫√±iga | Dear self righteous hypocrites:  I'm speaking specifically to "stars" in Hollywood, all media darlings, "news" networks and outraged politicians  stop this.Trump's comments are from 11 years ago but we (including teens and kids) have watched you grope yourselves on the stage and screen while wearing the MOST provocative outfits. We listen to your songs using this same language you suddenly find so offensive. We have watched you write and promote sado-masochistic mommy porn in not one book but 3 volumes (purchased by the millions). We have seen the husband of one candidate testify, purger and later be impeached all while watching this SAME candidate villainize the victimized women for coming forth. AND Trump is still the monster? Perhaps it's time we start paying attention to a few of these real issues.Are you for or against open borders? Are you for or against a President using Executive Action to indirectly roll back the 2nd amendment? Are you for or against a politician being held to a different standard of law and possible prosecution when those laws are broken? Are you for or against campaign finance reform? Are you for or against a baby not being protected by our Constitution until it actually comes out of the mother? Are you for or against a strong military? Are you for or against protecting our ambassadors and military over seas? Are you for or against an influx of refugees that can't possibly be properly vetted? Are you for or against higher corporate taxes and sending even more business overseas or into our southern neighbor? Are you for or against trade deals that put American manufacturing at a disadvantage? Are you for or against freedom of religion belonging to those sects other than Christianity? Are you for or against trade unions commanding so much power that they become direct surrogates of the Democratic Party? Are you for or against welfare reform?Yes perhaps it is time we pay less attention to something someone has said and start paying attention to what someone has actually done. Hillary's record speaks volumes. It's not only her person but her policy.
20 | Jeremy Porter | The Clintons have put the same fear in others as ISIS as. There are so many people who know the secrets of the Clintons but refuse to say anything because of the threat on their lives. I'm glad that Trump had a backbone and said everything that he said last night.
21 | Lizabeth Crump | Summer 2016 : Republicans are worried men will grope their wives and daughters in a bathroom Fall 2016: Republicans defend and vote for a man that brags about groping women. Okay then...
22 | Samuel Chute | If i became president of the United States Donald Trump would be the one put in jail.For not paying income taxes/For being a bullying moronic unstable lunatic/ For scamming poor and middle class people who trusted in him out of their money.And for acting like and being an accused rapist.Can you imagine this unstable buffoon Donald Trump as our President.World war 3 and nuclear weapons would be on the table and entire cities would be blown off the map.Trump is not a rational man he is a paranoid monster unfit to hold the high office of President.This is a world in which our potential enemies have nuclear weapons.This maniac Donald will be on Twitter bad mouthing someone while the nuclear weapons are coming down and pulverizing our country.Trump has all the characteristics of Adolf Hitler and you all know what happened to Hitler.
23 | James Quinn | This was more like an episode of Jerry Springer than a presidential debate.  If the American public had any sense they'd call to scrap the nominations and start again (another year of Obama as a caretaker president would be far from the worst outcome the USA could have) but, alas, too few of them have it seems.
24 | Dezmond Durden | See you all in November!  Just a reminder.....its not enough of you deplorable  fools to get him in office. And some of you really should not have kids and kill yourself and the kids you may have, for they may be just as dumb as ya'll.....see you fools in November!
25 | Heba Elshazly | If you're naming it Wrong you won't be able to defeat it also ! The correct name is Terror ! With a false cover of a religion ! And that's something out of many that u can't get it right Trump ! Just get back to ur " locker room" :p

"What Donald J. Trump was trying to do, even with the tape thing, is to say 'look, it's important, and I'm sorry, but we've got people dying ‚Äì while we're talking, somebody's getting shot in Chicago."

Rudy Giuliani said the debate made it quite clear that Trump is strong and Hillary Clinton is weak. Do you agree?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Daniel Reid | Hillary Clinton "It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country."Donald Trump "Yeah, because you'd be in jail."Best comeback in debate history
2 | Benj Gonda | Trump nailed it! Glad he upped his ante! He took a page from Pence. Very impressive. Took no sh*t and got the message out but in a very humble presidential way...I'm very proud to back this man with everything I have. Not to mention Slick Willie's face... that was the cherry on top.
3 | Joe Ditcharo | I'm a Proud Deplorable and will remain a Deplorable all the way to the Deplorable voting both to cast my Deplorable vote then get in my Deplorable Truck, drive back to my Deplorable house and spend a little time with my Deplorable family then get ready to go to sleep in my Deplorable Bed, wake up and go to my Deplorable job and repeat this process of my Deplorable life and wait for the results to hear that Deplorable Donald Trump won the Deplorable election and will soon be moving into the Deplorable White House to take over and lead this Deplorable country.. On the bright side, he's going to make America GREAT again!!!  :)
4 | Doug Edwards | Let's get this right we are worried about trumps temperment... When hillary on national TV calls out Russia for hacking and trying to ruin her campaign with no proof...?? Who's temperment is worse come on now??
5 | Diane Edge | He definitely won. He got under her skin, and there were times she could barely finish her thoughts. She had no new ideas ‚Ä¶ just the same old stuff. I'm still waiting for just ONE accomplishment that qualifies her as President. Supreme Court ‚Ä¶ terrorism ‚Ä¶ economy, especially when the stock market corrects ‚Ä¶ those are the reasons I will vote for Trump. That evil woman doesn't have a clue.
6 | Nicole Marie | Donald J. Trump is strong enough to knockout everyone who tries to stop him in the rigged debates. Tonight was 3 against 1 and he still won. Hillary is a weak candidate that has proven that she can be bought by our enemies.
7 | John Duff | Trump absolutely savaged her. He had Bill Clinton's rape victims present just a few feet away while he contrasted his actual crimes with his mere words - they did not, and could not deny his transgressions in the presence of their victims. He checkmated them finally after 30 years. His "you would be in jail" line stole the show and is the sound byte of the night by far. He crushed her tonight, and they know it.
8 | Rosario R. Castillo | Yes. He was angry but controlled himself during the debate. I saw a glimpse of the brilliant businessman who wins most of the time.
9 | Tommy George | In the meantime while all of this fuss about what a man said eleven years ago is going on Obama has given control of the Internet over to foreign interest and signed a gun control agree with the UN that includes allowing UN armed forces to operate on US soil. The one world order movement is winning while the newsmedia is creating the diversion. Wake up America!!!
10 | Harun Salaam | I guess I'll never understand the people who still support DJT when he uses the phrase "locker room talk" when admitting to sexually assaulting women. In case all you DJT supporters forgot, he was shouting from the rooftop of Trump Tower at the time to execute the Central Park 5. They were charged and convicted of sexual crimes they did not commit as proven by DNA evidence. Trump is heard admitting to committing violent sexual crimes. And he's the standard bearer for the Republican Party on Law and Order?
11 | Monica Hofer | Excellent debate. I later heard a media croney of Hillary's imply Trump was invading her space when she is the one who noticeably and repeatedly walked right over to his side, stood there and spoke to the audience on his side, whether the question came from there or not. She was clearly attempting to create a false scenario for the cameras and viewers. They also tried to make Trump look threatening or menacing by making H.C. look smaller physically. Didn't work.
12 | Sue Carlson | What he said in private is nothing -NOTHING in comparison to what Hillary has done with lack of security, lies, Benghazi (should I go in?) and add in her past with Slick Willie, and it's clear to me that words don't mean anything compared to actions.
13 | L.l. Basham | Wow! What a great comment I found on another post. A must read! "Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn‚Äôt make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, ‚ÄúTrump is arrogant.‚Äù My friend questioned if one man could make ‚Äúthat much difference in the world today.‚Äù To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, ‚ÄúReally, what has Trump done?‚ÄùI said, ‚ÄúIn June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family. Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren‚Äôt properly installed using proper law. Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it‚Äînews now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect. Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren‚Äôt liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall." Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees‚Äîif you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage. Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to ‚Äúliberals.‚ÄùAs the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he‚Äôs not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct. What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk‚Äîmeaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value. In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ‚ÄùAt this point, what do you have to lose?‚Äù We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system? One man has done all of this in one year‚Äîone guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I‚Äôve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we‚Äôre in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That‚Äôs your right. Just don‚Äôt ever say he‚Äôs not effective. That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh‚Äôs News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise ‚Ä¶ and they have collectively failed and miserably. Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase‚Äîthey're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing. Now, we have a generation of children who hate America. America‚Äôs problem isn‚Äôt that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans. You can disrespect America all you want. But, it‚Äôs high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they‚Äôre not simply the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù as you‚Äôve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them ‚Äúdeplorables.‚Äù The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year." From Be Forbes." Bebe Coe Bertino 9/29/2016 , this is a copy and paste, and needs to be read and spread!!
14 | Richard Horswell | Think Hillary was unprepared for all of Trump's criticisms tonight. Trump passive like Romney in the first debate. He completely fooled her into thinking he  was going to be mild mannered again.
15 | Eunice Hipe | Trump is focusing to protect the country (just being Trump) while Hilary was more to win her ticket, well-contained and (trained to act professionally). As for me Trump wins.
16 | Peggy Linder | Trump was great, honest, tells the truth as hard as that may seem to some, refreshing ,Hilary is corrupt lies to all, when caught in lies lies again ,she blamed it on Honest ABE. I prayed for Mr. Trump as well as Mr.Pence. Praying for The Trump team for all their safety. GOD,COUNTRY,TRUMP/PENCE IN THAT ORDER.
17 | David Christopher | Once again, Trump did NOT answer one question. Showing he's mentally unstable to be in office. Every question Hillary was asked, she should've started by saying, "thanks for not answering the question again, Donald." That would've been classic. These two are the worst and most unpopular candidates to EVER run. Ones worse than the other. It's a joke that this is what we're left to choose from. They're both compulsive liars and can't be trusted. I'm not a fan of either and neither belongs in the White House. PERIOD! Once again, Trump did NOT answer one question. He rambled and everything out of his mouth was blah, blah, blah. He keeps showing nothing but ignorance. That's just the way he is and he'll NEVER change. It's a disgrace to our Country and the Presidency that one will be in office. And anyone who supports either, should not vote and should be checked by a doctor. You want to make America Great Again, don't vote for either. PERIOD!
18 | Trevor Starritt | i hate to say this but obama was in chicago yesterday and rudi is right, i am sure their were drug gang incidentss and shootings while he was there but does he care, well i think poss not as if he did he would have tackled it long ago its too late now hussein
19 | Nancy Mitchell Gilliam | I still will NEVER vote for Hillary.  I am thinking that what is being said about his foul mouth comments is more of this "Oh I my ears are offended. I need a safe space."  Get real and grow up. Offensive things get said. Does not change the politics of what is happening to our country.
20 | Robbie Hansen | In 1978, Bill Clinton violently raped Juanita Broaddrick in a Little Rock, Arkansas, hotel room, then, as he was leaving, looked at her bloody lip and said: "Better put some ice on that‚Äù. Corroborated by five contemporaneous witnessesKnowing full well about Bill Clinton‚Äôs proclivity to sexually assault women, about three weeks after that rape, Hillary Clinton cornered Broaddrick at a party and said, pointedly, ‚ÄúI just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate the things you do for him. Do you understand? Everything you do.‚ÄùIn the early 1990s, Bill Clinton invited a young female staffer to his hotel room at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock, dropped his pants and said, ‚ÄúKiss it‚Äù. This was Paula Jones and she received a $ 850.000.00 settlement....Clinton rather settled than go further.In 1995 Bill Clinton had a young female intern just perform oral sex on him while he made business calls right in the Oval Office. That girl‚Äôs name was Monica Lewinsky. She may have volunteered for the sex at that young age but Monica Lewinsky didn‚Äôt volunteer to be slandered!Hillary Clinton deployed her aides and journalist friends, like Sidney Blumenthal, to spread rumors that Monica was a stalker, trying to blackmail the president and destroyed her life.Hillary Clinton's recorded remark about the situation: she called Lewinsky ‚Äúa narcissistic loony tune‚Äù.Bill Clinton declared that he ‚Äúhad not had sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky‚Äù, ... which proved to be another lie.The affair and its repercussions, which included Bill Clinton's impeachment, became known as the Lewinsky scandal.When an attractive woman desperately in need of a job came to Bill's office in 1993, instead of helping, he lunged at her, kissed her on the mouth, grabbed her breast and put her hand on his genitals. He later told a mistress that the claim was absurd because the woman, Kathleen Willey, had such small breasts.Hillary Clinton went on 60 Minutes to slime nightclub singer Gennifer Flowers, knowing full well she was telling the truth about having an affair with Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton implied Genniger Flowers belonged in a loony bin, telling millions of viewers ‚Äúevery time she called, distraught‚Ä¶ she said sort of wacky things.‚ÄùAfter denying it first, in his presidential deposition in January 1998, Bill Clinton admitted that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers.The Clintons are evil and Hillary has destroyed many women's lives knowing fully well that they did not lie about their sexual encounters with her pervert husband Bill Clinton.Hillary is NOT FOR WOMEN!Bill Clinton visited Orgy Island (young girls as young as 12 years old) 26 times with his good friend, registered sex offender and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein‚Äôs Boeing 727 is so notorious that it earned the nickname the ‚ÄúLolita Express.‚Äù And flight logs now reveal that former President Bill Clinton took 26 trips on his jet
21 | Tahani Leus | Honestly I'm over it all! Let's just fast forward to November already, Hillary and her pets have turned this into a circus. Trump is no saint either. Just so tired of high school politics
22 | Tracey Ritchie | This is a long read but i PROMISE its worth it, especially to you younger people that have NO CLUE what 30 yrs were like with Hillary because your not old enough. So when you say things about Donald Trump because he keeps bringing up the last 30 years with Hillary.... I'm afraid it's not as easy as saying she could have voted different. There's a very big picture here. And when you're still learning to ride a two-wheeler or playing with Barbie dolls or Hotwheels you don't realize this is what was going on in our country with Ms Hillary. Again, I can forgive things that Donald Trump may have said but these are things that Hillary Clinton has done.How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
23 | Sonia S√°nchez de Enr√≠quez | How exactly did he win the debate? Instead of answering questions being asked, he was rambling and babbling on about Obama and Clinton doing this or that but never fully answered a question.
24 | Silas Acha | Shut up old man. The orange clown lost again. He stood behind Hillary trying to grab her by the pussy .while she controlled the debate and schooled him.
25 | Deb Williamson | Vote Trump for the simple reason he tells it as it is, plus politics is new to him so corruption hasn't had time to take hold. He is working for the people!

1 | Carter Casper | Donald Trump destroyed Crooked Hillary 100%. She tried to take him down with an eleven year old video, I'd say it back fired, big league. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
2 | Linda Maydole | As a woman who has heard a lot worse said about women from other women (Joan Rivers comes to mind) and seen women objectifying themselves (Miley Cyrus comes to mind), I think what Donald said 11 years ago means little in the scope of problems facing this country.
3 | Tony McClain | As a deplorable I will put it to you this way. Killary thought she had this in the bag coming in and The Donald kicked her square in the dick!!!
4 | Nicole Nayr | Trump owned who he is unlike Clinton! It was very Presidential of Trump. Same can not be said about Clinton. That is why Trump won this debate!!!
5 | Vicki Maher | I am a recent widow. Obamacare killed my husband 12/16/1.' I have Cerebral Palsy and put myself through college and worked 41 yrs. in social services. Donald Trump is my hero and my only hope.
6 | Shannon Hannah | I was raised to never trust a liar, and because Hillary said;Its just allergies.Its just cough.I got over heated.I tripped.I have a cold.I have the flu.I have pneumonia.I don't have a server at homeI didn't use my server at home.I didn't send or receive emails from my phone.I didn't delete any emails.I didn't know C stood for confidential.I don't trust her.
7 | Jeremy Porter | I have a question for democrats. Be honest. Do you think that if you were under investigation for a crime and you had deleted thousands of your emails do you think you would go to prison? Some of you will follow Hillary to the gates of hell literally but be honest with yourself and others. You know you would go to prison for half of what Hillary has done. When will some of you realize that she is not good for this country?
8 | Nicholas DeSenso | Donald Trump picked Hillary up like a mop and wiped the sh*t-house floor with her.
9 | Kenny Gardner | Trump Not Only DEFEATED Hillary Clinton but he also DEFEATED the Media and the Clinton National News Network anchors aka CNN. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain#Trump2016
10 | David Steele | She claimed Lincoln said two different things to two different people. That's true, but his *position* never changed.Hillary's private statement was that you have to say one thing in public, and mean another thing in private. Unlike Lincoln, she changes her *position* according to the audience, not her argument.
11 | Mira Misselli | When Hillary was answering questions. Donald should follow up by saying " now is that your public or private opinion. Is this all going to change when you are elected, the American people need to know
12 | Tim Chadd Sr. | Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."
13 | Lynore Oliveri | When Roe vs Wade comes out of her mouth. Since she's soooo for kids ask her anout her and Obamas laws allow abortion til 36 weeks!! That is full term! If that's not murder and it's okayed by this administration it is unconsciousable !!! MURDER !!! They suck the brains out of a viable human being !!! With arms and legs flailing they scream in utero! Anyone thinking that's ok needs to go straight to hell
14 | Joe Ditcharo | I'm a Proud Deplorable and will remain a Deplorable all the way to the Deplorable voting both to cast my Deplorable vote then get in my Deplorable Truck, drive back to my Deplorable house and spend a little time with my Deplorable family then get ready to go to sleep in my Deplorable Bed, wake up and go to my Deplorable job and repeat this process of my Deplorable life and wait for the results to hear that Deplorable Donald Trump won the Deplorable election and will soon be moving into the Deplorable White House to take over and lead this Deplorable country.. On the bright side, he's going to make America GREAT again!!!  :)
15 | Don Frasier | 2016...The Democrat nominee has to win the election to stay out of jail...'Murica
16 | Jeremy J. Gabel | I CHECKED THE FACTS HILLARY CLINTON: Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress. Hillary Clinton deleted 30 some thousand emails after she was PC is killing our nation. I don't care what Donald Trump said 11 years ago. It's doesn't hold a candle to Hillary Clinton's entire political history. If that's all you got media good luck with that.Hillary Clinton had that same computer wiped clean by professionals. Hillary Clinton got the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughed about it. Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about Benghazi. Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about her emails. Hillary Clinton lied about being under sniper fire. Hillary Clinton lied about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary. Hillary Clinton lied about lying to the American people. Hillary Clinton was involved in ‚ÄúCash Cow ‚Äú. Hillary Clinton has a long list of scandals. Hillary Clinton nationally belittled her husband's numerous sexual harassment (and rape) accusers. Hillary Clinton is a career politician. Hillary Clinton will not release her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banks. Hillary Clinton is tied to Monsanto. Hillary Clinton was labeled ‚ÄúExtremely careless ‚Äúabout national security by the FBI! Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class. Hillary Clinton benefited from the DNC rigging an election! Hillary Clinton had to return stolen items from the White House. Hillary Clinton said the Benghazi victims parents where lying. Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her based on her gender. Hillary Clinton has named Republicans as her biggest enemy. Hillary Clinton has no real accomplishments after a lifetime in politics. Hillary Clinton has never created any jobs. Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI and found to have put national security at risk. Hillary Clinton has had two or more movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics. Hillary Clinton called then President Bill Clinton "cock sucker" in front of the (SS) Secret service. Hillary Clinton was called "Broomstick one" by the Secret Service. Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place! Fact - all facts! Hillary Clinton regularly cussed out and belittled her Secret Service detail. Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton over and over again.
17 | Edmund Morrison | Trump... unless you follow CNN, in which case you know that Killary won tonight's debate a week ago...
18 | Brett Hansen | Trump won this debate, first one was close. I was initially a Ben Carson supporter, I'm not 100% for either candidate but it's an easy choice between trump and Hillary to me. People need to stop voting simply on character (we all have faults) but issues. Something I hope to hear more of in the next debate.I still feel that trump would defend our nation better and help our struggling economy. I will take someone who arrogantly defends themselves over someone who arrogantly deceives the American people. Not a 100% supporter but it's an EASY vote for trump over the liar Hillary anyday.This coming from a guy who lived in Flint MI the all of the last decade.
19 | David James | HILLARY CLINTON: "It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country."DONALD TRUMP: "Because you would be in jail." BURN
20 | Debbie Parker | Hillary stated that Trump never apologizes for anything he says, he did this within the first 3 minutes of this debate. Lying again Hillary and 35 million viewers heard you. We're you sleeping when he apologized? Did you briefly heard him and still refused to accept the TRUTH when it was right in front of you? Is that it Hillary, you can't handle the TRUTH when you hear it?
21 | Janette Worley | Trump. You want to know Donald Trump??Look no further than the last question. Trump could have said, "her honesty"... or"her loyalty to her adulteress husband"but he did not.He respects her "drive", "her will", "never giving up."  That was respectful and classy.Hillary refused to be gracious. She complimented Trumps kids. (Not Trump) which kinda backfired. Most of us believe that Trump is a good dad.
22 | Rhonda Endsley Smith | Watch Hannity Monday evening. Some of Bill's accusers will be on along with the 12 year old rape victim Hillary laughed at years ago. They want the world to know how Hillary treated them.
23 | Charles J. Harper | What was wrong with M. Kelly tonight...looked like her eyes were ready to pop out of her head!   She was attacking anyone who thought Trump made a good point. Trump won this one going away. Only the media and a few nuts are interested in this 11 year old tape of Trump...ISSUES are what counts.
24 | Clifford Francis | Donald Trump definitely! He was on top of all the issues and really went after Hillary Clinton's corruption this time around! He even also was able to put what he said 11 years ago to bed! Great night for Donald Trump!
25 | Billy Hedge | I wrote a poem for Mr TrumpShare it if you like!Dear Mr. Trump,You came to us So fresh and warm,Suddenly, like a summer storm.People laughed, andpeople balked.They said, all you were was a bunch of talk. But I knew, Yes I knew, from the very start, That your message was coming straight from your heart.Saving our jobs!Taking care of our Vets!Something their sacrifice will finally beget.And you promised to build us the hugest wall, (with laser beams my grandson's say)To keep us safer, after all.And our officers in blue you humbly praised For risking their lives in service each day A few times you spoutedAn off color wordBut it kept you in the headlinesSo your message was heardAnd you just kept standing, proud and tall,Among  many good men That could of done the job well, But America needed someone,That could ring it's bell Ring it loud and ring it clearWith a message of strength The people could hear!With your beautiful family at your side You've given us hope and a new sense of pride!I pray God protects you each and every day!As you lead our nation backTo the American way!To the land of the free, and the home of the braveYou have given your heartIn trying to save.....What so many fought forAt such a great costBecause freedom to them Was worth the lives that they lost Now at a time with our freedoms in strife You've come out of the blue to save the American lifeAnd many people  listened....And gave their hearts to you when....You said......LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!We've had eight long years with a race dividerWe need you Mr.Trump!

Breaking News: The Pentagon says Iran-backed Houthi rebels fired two missiles at a U.S. Navy destroyer off the coast of Yemen in the Red Sea on Sunday. Neither missile reached the American warship, but a US defense official tells Fox News that the ship was targeted. http://fxn.ws/2e6q90A
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jordan Ortiz | Trump to Hillary "Because you'd be in jail"Still cracking me up.
2 | Rob Wh | Let's see... Looks like the $1.2 billion we gave them really paid off didn't it? Perhaps Obama will send another $1.2 billion as an apology for being too close to them in the sea. Stop this now! Vote Trump/Pence!
3 | Matthew Gunnoe | Americans spent over $4 billion on porn last year. Yet everyone but Trump holds women in high regard....hypocrites. Even he can't afford that bill -so someone's lyin'. #TRUMP2016
4 | Alana Wynn Wood | Wake up America! When there is a distraction, you need to see what is going on, what are you being distracted from? More leaked information?!? More on her speeches?!? What is it?!? If you are not in the liberal elite, you are a "bucket of losers" and half of Trump supporters are a "basket of deplorables". She can not be a president for ALL of the people of the USA, not with her views. Research it, you can't depend on the media.The MEDIA takes us for FOOLS#Trump #NeverHillary
5 | Robert Butler | I am a retired Navy man, a destroyer sailor in fact. Before Obama, if you fired on a U.S. Navy ship, even if you missed, we killed you. A Navy ship is sovereign American territory, and firing on a Naval vessel is the same as firing on New York.
6 | Rachel Ann | ƒéont worry folks. Hillary has it all under control. She will talk them into being nicer next time. Says no one!!!  I rather be safe then worrying about a rude comment trump said 11yrs. Ago #trump #trump2016
7 | Kimberly Thomas Krol | didn't obama just lift some of the trade sanctions against Iran a couple days ago?  he just keeps giving them opportunity to spit in his face....our faces...
8 | Patrick Nicholson | Drop a nuke on Iran. Their actions were a declaration of war. Put warheads on their foreheads. #Trump2016üá∫üá∏üí™üèªüöÇ
9 | Evan LaCross | The foreign policy of this administration has been an utter disaster. This is horrendous and we look weak. Appeasement leads to war.
10 | Adam Mccoy | How many people are voting Trump? Just like if you are. I really think the media is trying to rig this election.
11 | Michelle Hammons Budoff | Please pray for our military. My son is out there right now. Thanks!
12 | Joey Conway | Welp time to hit the red button and send the whole Middle East back to the Stone Age.... I hear Starbucks chipotle and McDonald's are looking to expand their franchises. Obama should've been impeached for Breaking the "never making deals with terrorists" rule the US government had upheld until this Catastrophe of a president got in. He's endangered us all for far too long.
13 | Freddy Guilliams | Most of you are not old enough to remember I guess, but these cowards were very bold during the Carter administration (also democrats) and the moment Ronald Reagan was sworn in to office they tucked their tails and ran away.
14 | Norma Pacheco | I'm on the fence on Trump and now that I saw this so called debate , I loved what  He said about Hilary belonging in jail. I totally agree with that.
15 | Steve Farley | Thanks Mr. President. We could have housed a lot of homeless Americans with that 1.2 billion. Instead they use the money to kill us.
16 | Mary Minerd Speegle | Wonder if they paid for these missiles with the hostage ransom or the Iran deal money? Either way Obama and Clinton gave them the money for these missiles . Still think Clinton knows how to deal with Iran ?
17 | Carol Long | Iran is going to be so nice to us after we give them all of the money, this is the delusional thinking with Obummer!! Hillary will be the same way and get us into another war! Donald J. Trump for a strong president!!
18 | Debi Rutledge Welch | Prayers, people, over our country and our military defending us. We need to be on our knees in prayer. Read your bible. See the predictions. I'm not trying to be an alarmist however, this is getting very real.
19 | Jacky Goad | So glad Hillary and Obama signed that deal with Iran and gave them millions or billions of our tax dollars so they can pay these rebels to shoot at us!!!! Gives a whole new meaning to stupid!
20 | Mike Ryan | Obama on Friday late afternoon under the media radar (as usual) took unilateral action to reduce economic sanctions on Iran even further. Please fact-check this one. It's unbelievable.
21 | Justin Wolf | Can you imagine what would happen if those missiles hit that Navy destroyer?!?!?! Iran would no longer exist, tell me if I'm wrong but isn't that a declaration of war?
22 | Amber Newton | Thank you Obummer and Killary. This is ALL you!! And we will do absolutely NOTHING about it except maybe apologize or give them more money. Sad sad sad!!
23 | Will Crump | Isn't Iran the country that Obama made the nuclear weapons deal with where we ended up getting absolutely no benefits from? I would've never guess that a country that hates us would be attacking us or using that deal against us.
24 | Donna B LeBlanc | People better wake up. Put your phone down and see the real world. All those bad things you see on your phone will be you, I and everyone if we don't stop what is happening. Vote vote to fix it before it's to late.
25 | Michael Fortner | Hillary Clinton answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is?

Hillary Clinton said she believes Russia is "all in" in Syria and doesn't want her as commander in chief.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Shawn McBride | Guess what Hillary? Your worst nightmare is coming. You're going to get to face Fox News and have to answer some real questions in the next debate for once. Get your rest and study up. Can't wait!!
2 | Zach Kerman | Trump just told Hillary to her face you should be in jail, this man is truly one of a kind and it's his take no $hit attitude that's won a nation, give her hell Trump she deserves it and so much more
3 | Don Riddle | A real Commander in Chief leaves no one behind, we know she doesn't care who she leaves behind. And if it is impossible to bring them home or save them, a real Commander takes the blame, not lying and shifting it to others. She is no Commander in Chief her record proves it!
4 | Theresa Clemons | I have much respect for the four ladies who appeared with Mr. Trump tonight. It took great courage for all of them, but especially for the lady who was raped when she was 12, to come forward and tell their stories. No one denies that defense attorneys have a job to do; that is what our judicial system is all about. But what woman would crush a child and then laugh about it gleefully? This one incident in Hill's life tells us exactly what she is. She doesn't care about anyone as long as what happens benefits her agenda. This is evil; not a good attorney practicing law, but pure evil.
5 | Vicki Randolph Chavez | Trump brought it home! Hillary on the defensive and struggling to lie for all to see when hit with the truth. Loved it...and that bizaar smile of hers when she's losing. ;)And still no apologies from Hillary for all her "mistakes" and to all the victimized women her and Bill abused.Btw: Was Hillary comparing herself to Abraham Lincoln???!!!! LMBO!Would someone give that woman a flag pin?
6 | Suzanne Bliss Erickson | They say history always repeats itself, so when Trump is elected and has Hillary prosecuted, maybe they should bring back public hangings and sell tickets to the event. Boom! Deficit paid!
7 | Jr Wolfe | I think Russia would love for Hillary to be President. They know, if they attack us with nuclear missiles, Trump will retaliate. BHO and Hillary would be more worried about the environment than our Constitution and our liberty and freedom.
8 | Frank Otto | She claims Trump has business ties to Russia, but Hillary received $145M in donations to her private piggy bank foundation from the Russian businessmen who she sold American uranium to!
9 | Zach Kerman | While I do not condone Trump's statements concerning some women in the past, I hope he has changed and he is not that person today. People can change. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton continues her never ending state of lies and deceit. She does't stop! She is unrepentant! She has supported Bill Clinton's alleged rape and abuse of women. She has vilified the women, but not Bill Clinton's actions. Our Country is not safe with Hillary Clinton. She will allow this Country to be overrun by Islamic, unvetted refugees and illegal aliens from all nations by her open borders plans. She must never be president.
10 | JR Heim | The establishment were given a death blow tonight. Both the Republican elite and the Democrats are conspiring to defeat Trump and the MSM are co-conspirators. Do not let them use the bogus Russia connection. This is there trump card to use when all else fails, to void the election. The corrupt establishment and the MSM are trying for the greatest rigged election in world history.
11 | Thomas Aguila | BEST COME BACK IN DEBATE HISTORY?HILLARY CLINTON: It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country."DONALD TRUMP: "Because you would be in jail."
12 | Bonnie Sarah | Lincoln makes her lie and Putin stays up nights to ruin her campaign.  Well Putin I suppose could be going thru her trash but some one needs to tell her Lincoln is dead. They talked to her on the plane later. She looked drunk. And she would not look at the camera. She was looking at the ceiling or the floor
13 | Jeremy Porter | You also have millions of hard working Americans who do not want you as Commander in Chief either! Go ahead with your pity party and understand 2 things in the process. You will not continue to get by with lying to the American people without consequence. Number 2, you'll go to prison once Trump wins. Sleep good tonight you devil.
14 | Charles Paschal | Why would Russia want her in Syria? She is the one that armed ISIS. They are fighting ISIS. Because Obama says they are JV.
15 | Jee Willerker | they got all the uranium they needed from you, Hillary....and you got a huge amount of money for the Clinton Foundation...you are the one in bed with the Russians!
16 | Terri Lamke | She'll say or do anything, anything to win. She had a chance handed to her to defend her calling the Trump supporters Deploreables. Her response was "I was wrong when I said half" what does that mean exactly? All Trump supporters then??? TRUMP/PENCE 2016 now more then ever!
17 | Shane Gauldin | Lady. You keep running your mouth about Russia without FACTS of them hacking the dnc is stupid! I'd guess it's a few honest people in Washington sick of what you dipshits are doing to America is your leaks!
18 | Geri Harper | If we don't get a president who will clean up the mess current administration has made in Syria for past 8 years it may well lead to war. including nuclear. between Russia and the U.S.
19 | Jay Day | So stupid.  Keeps trying to revive the cold war and that Donald J. Trump is with them.  Say, guess what Hillary.  If you're not saying bad things; lying deceitful things, then, it wouldn't matter what Russia, China, Wikileaks or a 400 lb guy in his mother's basement found. In fact, if you were honest, it would be beneficial.  Also, if you were not on an unsecured server, that you took it upon yourself to install and use, to cover up your dishonest dealings, then, our country wouldn't have had to spend millions of dollars investigating you and having you take part in the destruction of the FBI, to go along with the 33,000 emails you destroyed, after they were subpoenaed. Criminal!
20 | Lisa Griffin | Recall that Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Barack Hussein Obama writes about him in his books.How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare ‚Äî Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty ‚Äî Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt ‚Äî Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control ‚Äî Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare ‚Äî Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education ‚Äî Take control of what people read and listen to ‚Äî take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion ‚Äî Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare ‚Äî Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?
21 | Tricia Campbell | I have to commend Hillary on one thing: she hasn't used sexism as a reason for her unpopularity as much as I thought she would. She's found a more effective scapegoat: Russia. Ironic, considering President Obama openly sneered at Mitt Romney four years ago when Romney said Russia was our biggest threat. I guess the dems just want it both ways.
22 | Bonnie Lou Prunty Cline | Did you hear her slip that statement in, when she said, if you don't vote for me, I will still be the President of the United States!!!!!!  Fraud must be in the making for the next 29 days, please folks, watch the voting polls, get out and get your friends to vote for Trump!!!!
23 | David Harris | Hummm. Looks like Russia picked one candidate and the American media the other.  Glad I get to vote because I don't trust either group.
24 | Myra Quarles | Russia,Iran and isis all want you as potus because you're a low life and you and obama are destroying america.You are their prize an american woman running for potus who sports a hijab so disrespectful to women and our constitution.
25 | Andy Birr | A lot of people have forgotten that as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, with the help of Bill Clinton, agreed to a deal with Putin that has given Russia 20% of the United States uranium supply because she and the Clinton foundation profited from this deal through donations and contributions made to the foundation. Pay-to-play? I think so. I just cannot believe her when she says she has talked tough with Russia, when it's Clinton who has the business dealings with Russia, not Trump. Just watch Clinton Cash and this will all start making sense. If you want to know where the Clinton's stand on the issues or what there up to.... just follow the money and you'll find them. Corruption at its finest.

"I have to always look at the full measure of an individual, no matter who he or she is. And I know Donald J. Trump to be very gracious and a gentleman."

Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said she is "not going to excuse what he said on the tapes" but noted he did apologize and will keep working for those who don't have a voice.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Eric Miller | Fox News, as much as you don't like it, Donald Trump CRUSHED Hillary Clinton tonight, and exposed her for the lying, corrupted snake that she is.   And to top that off, she actually responded to his barrage by lying again and again.
2 | Ben Abner | This just may be his blessing in disguise. His chance to show the world his humbleness and his courage. Very important leadership qualities.
3 | Darwin Lee Anthony | This was the most disgusting part of the whole night.. Megan Kelly is clearly in the tank for Hillary and she is trying to do damage control. She thinks she is being slick but she is so obvious.
4 | Richard Perales | TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN!! He proved to the world that the system is Rigged!! From the moderators to Hillary.Then again proved to the world and the United States, that Hillary DID NOT wear the American Flag Pin on her fancy Pant Suit!! I guess she really does not have pride in our country.
5 | Rick Dalberg | Megyn Kelly is an embarrassment. Her program is trash journalism which preys on ambushing Trump supporters while lobbing softballs at Hillary supporters. Megyn has lost credibility with middle America and her ignorance of facts which support Trump is overwhelming. She has sold out to the Liberal elitists in Washington DC because she is looking for acceptance. She should be ashamed at how low she has let herself sink. She went from credible to an embarrassment all because she has a personal agenda against Trump. That has made her untrustworthy.
6 | Colt Remington | I hate Megan Kelly. How many times between now and Election Day will she replay the 2005 video? No wonder she's losing to Hannity
7 | Amir Parvez | Hillary Clinton is a threat to American Democracy (what's left of it) and world peace. A vote for her is a vote for worldwide economic slavery and evil, endless war! She's a corrupt, evil, lying warmonger who already has blood on her hands of thousands of people and millions of dollars of blood money in the Clinton Foundation. #NeverHillary #HillaryForPrison2016
8 | Mike Batdorf | Megyn was non stop going after Trump with each and every guest. Please Fox get her off the air. I actually switched to CNN she was so nauseating.
9 | Braden Sisk | Good lord. Trumps comments were merely about how "fanatical" people can be around celebrities, letting celebs grab and do whatever they want to them. It's true, just ask all the liberal pedophile actors and directors in Hollywood...
10 | Joseph J Martin | "Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn‚Äôt make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, ‚ÄúTrump is arrogant.‚Äù My friend questioned if one man could make ‚Äúthat much difference in the world today.‚Äù To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, ‚ÄúReally, what has Trump done?‚ÄùI said, ‚ÄúIn June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren‚Äôt properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it‚Äînews now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect. Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren‚Äôt liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees‚Äîif you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage. Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to ‚Äúliberals.‚Äù As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he‚Äôs not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct. What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk‚Äîmeaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value. In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ‚ÄùAt this point, what do you have to lose?‚Äù We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system? One man has done all of this in one year‚Äîone guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I‚Äôve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we‚Äôre in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That‚Äôs your right. Just don‚Äôt ever say he‚Äôs not effective. That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh‚Äôs News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise ‚Ä¶ and they have collectively failed and miserably. Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase‚Äîthey're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing. Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America‚Äôs problem isn‚Äôt that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans. You can disrespect America all you want. But, it‚Äôs high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they‚Äôre not simply the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù as you‚Äôve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them ‚Äúdeplorables.‚Äù The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year.' -- by Be Forbes
11 | Haseeb Ahmad | I am a hillary supporter..I hate conservatives..doesn't matter if I agree with trump on certain issues..problemlies with trump supporters who are mainly racists..if trump won..racism will be empowered in America..which will be disaster.
12 | Mollie Wills Campbell | Pull Megyn Kelly from debate moderation! She is very bitter towards Trump. At least these other women don't put up with her. Hannity is who we want!
13 | Eric Millsap | I used to believe Fox News was "fair and balanced". Its the only news I've watched for years. This election has pulled the curtain back on that one. Megan Kelly clearly has an agenda, or she's working hard for some else's agenda. Almost everything she says is either a direct attack on Trump or slanted inflammatory questions.
14 | Miechelle Bicksler Greeson | Meg Kelly I like you I really do but you have not gotten over your Trump thing. I thought you two resolved the issue but you seem to be constantly after him.... Why?  Do you support Hillary.... The liar... The murder of troops, the murder of last term abortion , the in crease in taxes, her so called new health care, her support in not going to jail for crimes and her calling names to the women Bill Clinton did wrong too??!!
15 | Chris Stuckey | Megan Kelly can't seem to run the 2005 video enough.  It's obvious to the viewers she has a chip on shoulder about Mr. Trump.  If she likes the video so much, she can make it her ringtone.  Otherwise, get over the hurt feelings, get professional, and do the fair and balanced reporting we expect from Fox.      If she wants to continue the biased reporting based on her hate for Mr. Trump, then she can move to MSNBC or PBS.  They seem to thrive on that stuff there.
16 | Denise Pilkington | In 1978, Bill Clinton violently raped Juanita Broaddrick in a Little Rock, Arkansas, hotel room, then, as he was leaving, looked at her bloody lip and said: "Better put some ice on that‚Äù. Corroborated by five contemporaneous witnessesKnowing full well about Bill Clinton‚Äôs proclivity to sexually assault women, about three weeks after that rape, Hillary Clinton cornered Broaddrick at a party and said, pointedly, ‚ÄúI just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate the things you do for him. Do you understand? Everything you do.‚ÄùIn the early 1990s, Bill Clinton invited a young female staffer to his hotel room at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock, dropped his pants and said, ‚ÄúKiss it‚Äù. This was Paula Jones and she received a $ 850.000.00 settlement....Clinton rather settled than go further.In 1995 Bill Clinton had a young female intern just perform oral sex on him while he made business calls right in the Oval Office. That girl‚Äôs name was Monica Lewinsky. She may have volunteered for the sex at that young age but Monica Lewinsky didn‚Äôt volunteer to be slandered! Hillary Clinton deployed her aides and journalist friends, like Sidney Blumenthal, to spread rumors that Monica was a stalker, trying to blackmail the president and destroyed her life.Hillary Clinton's recorded remark about the situation: she called Lewinsky ‚Äúa narcissistic loony tune‚Äù.Bill Clinton declared that he ‚Äúhad not had sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky‚Äù, ... which proved to be another lie. The affair and its repercussions, which included Bill Clinton's impeachment, became known as the Lewinsky scandal.When an attractive woman desperately in need of a job came to Bill's office in 1993, instead of helping, he lunged at her, kissed her on the mouth, grabbed her breast and put her hand on his genitals. He later told a mistress that the claim was absurd because the woman, Kathleen Willey, had such small breasts.Hillary Clinton went on 60 Minutes to slime nightclub singer Gennifer Flowers, knowing full well she was telling the truth about having an affair with Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton implied Genniger Flowers belonged in a loony bin, telling millions of viewers ‚Äúevery time she called, distraught‚Ä¶ she said sort of wacky things.‚ÄùAfter denying it first, in his presidential deposition in January 1998, Bill Clinton admitted that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers. The Clintons are evil and Hillary has destroyed many women's lives knowing fully well that they did not lie about their sexual encounters with her pervert husband Bill Clinton. Hillary is NOT FOR WOMEN! Bill Clinton visited Orgy Island (young girls as young as 12 years old) 26 times with his good friend, registered sex offender and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein‚Äôs Boeing 727 is so notorious that it earned the nickname the ‚ÄúLolita Express.‚Äù And flight logs now reveal that former President Bill Clinton took 26 trips on his jet Plz copy and share so younger voters can learn who the Clintons are...
17 | Jessica Gibson | I love that he finally brought out a lot of issues that the moderators have been overlooking e.g. e-mails, Benghazi, sexual misconduct, etc. The media is very biased when it comes to the candidates and so are the moderators (unfortunately). But, I'm glad that he called them out on it and stood his ground.  The debate was worth watching because he unloaded and said what he needed to say!
18 | Jammye Clark Scott | Megyn Kelley is a bully and she got her facts wrong on Juanita Broadrick. I hate that Fox puts her on for debate coverage. Her bias shows!
19 | Francoise Addison | Lou Dobbs needs to announce why he thinks Billy Bush, the leaker of the Trump womanizer tape, did this. Nephew of George HW Bush, cousin to Dubya & Jeb, I guess you don't fool with the Bushes, either..
20 | Bret MX | Trump confronted the devil. That was amazing. Didn't give the crook a inch. Like a boss. Trump 2016. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏Hillary on trial.
21 | Matthew Daniels | I like how Trumps deplorables all conglomerate/congeal here on FOXNEWS in their little safe space so they can proclaim the rest of the world is biased again THEM while they bring up online polls that are easilly manipulated and overrun with Russian bots casting multiple times. Meanwhile in the sane world Clinton scientifically won the debate with data taken from actual voter (People vote outside of Trump fantasy land). Enjoy the safe space he's losing. (Spare me the Libtard, Beta male, communist insults. They only reinforce my suspicions that you're a bunch of freaks.)
22 | Jan Wood-molony | I'm so sick of Megyn Kelly! She interrupts her guests! Argues with them! Get a clue Ms. Kelly....it's not you we tune to see! I hope Fox gets rid of you!
23 | JayKimberlyeatherton Miller | Megan Kelley needs to go work for a liberal network like cnn, or just go straight to hillary and beg for a job with the libtard. She is a liberal too and I won't watch her in foxnews anymore!
24 | Louise Jarels Mattox | The debate was great,Trump was great and he won, the worst part was having to watch Megan Kelly, she needs to get off of the prime time programming, can't watch her
25 | Aldo Francisco Suero | I loved Kellyanne Conway and the way she did not let Megan Kelly spew her verbal diarrhea attacking our future President Donald J. Trump.

4 | Mike Dixon | There is so much crap spewing out of Hillarys mouth, flies are landing on her face.
5 | Timothe Ryan | If you're a 1 issue voter, Trump putting hillary in jail is about the best news anyone could hear! #Trump2016 #KansasDeplorable #VetsForTrump #HillaryForPrison2016
6 | Alex Shaffiey | Presidential debate goes something like What is your name? Donald: Donald Trump. Hillary: he is lying to all of you, it's false. Check my fact checker.
7 | Anthony Nardelli | Moderators: Mr. Trump, what day is it?Trump: Sun...Moderators: Mr. Trump, answer the question.
8 | Mary Lou Melter Collins | Recall that Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Barack Hussein Obama writes about him in his books.How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare ‚Äî Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty ‚Äî Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt ‚Äî Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control ‚Äî Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare ‚Äî Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education ‚Äî Take control of what people read and listen to ‚Äî take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion ‚Äî Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare ‚Äî Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?Never Hillary Please share
9 | Joseph Carrino | Omg!..This is awesome...Trump is as real as it gets...right to your face with the truth...it's about time that these Clinton's paid a price for all ppl that they hurt on they way to power and money...We must elect Trump!!
10 | John JJ Pollock | Clinton:" It is awfully good that somebody with the tempermant of Donald Trump is not in charge of the laws in this country."Trump: "Yeah cause you'd be in jail."DEBATE OVER!
11 | John Currier | I hope he actually does do this.  Just once in my life I would like to see Bill or Hillary held accountable for what they've done.
12 | Amir Parvez | Hillary Clinton is a threat to American Democracy (what's left of it) and world peace. A vote for her is a vote for worldwide economic slavery and evil, endless war! She's a corrupt, evil, lying warmonger who already has blood on her hands of thousands of people and millions of dollars of blood money in the Clinton Foundation. #NeverHillary
13 | Robert Tracy | Some of the corrupt political elites are getting ready to flee the country and go into exile, that is why untraceable pallets of cash are leaving the treasury.
14 | Elle Nora H. Amrani | I hope the viewers enjoyed when Hillary responded to Trump's words that everything he said was a lie, then in the next response to the moderators she contradicted her previous comment which proved Trump didn't lie - she did. Hilarious.
15 | Fanizia Papi | Him appointing a special prosecutor to look into her private server and all the rest of her corruption is reason enough to vote for him!!!!
16 | Caroline Piland | Awesome. Now please get Megyn Kelly off this network! She is harping on ALL negative things about #Trump. Ok! the man made a mistake. He apologized!!!! . She said she wanted to hear more about issues but all she brings up is the tape and her questioning him back in Aug 2015. Move on!!!! We have more to worry about then this crap and your insecurities!!!
17 | Connie Storey | If Trump wins , you will not be able to find the Clintons . . . Im guessing they will flee the country and if she cant make good on all her high dollar laundered donations , she may be safer in jail . . . Those countries are expecting something for their money . . . Thing is they were totally blindsided by Trump . . . like the JV Isis team , they clearly underestimated the phenomenon Trump .
18 | Luke Miller | She's finished! Trump exposed her for what she really is. A corrupt serial liar who will say anything to get elected. Hopefully James Comey and Loretta Lynch will be next! Goodbye Hillary! üëåüèª
19 | Salvatore A. Minnella Sr. | Remember all the Republicans in office who have turned on Trump including Paul Ryan.. Trump showed all of them that he is in it to win it with or without them. It is we the people who will elect Trump to POTUS not the turncoats....
20 | Carol Bennett | Did you hear the nation clapping??!! Yeah! She knows you'll do it too. Be prepared, she will fight to the end to stay out of prison.
21 | Anne Valentine | You could tell, Hillary is NOT used to people telling her like it is. She was ANGRY majority of this debate, and Bill clintons face when Trump was talking about the woman he raped??? OMG PRICELESS!!!!!!
22 | Maria Cismowski | I used to respect Megan Kelley. She needs to go work for PBS or CNN.  Sick of her liberal bias and hatred for Donald Trump! Go away.
23 | John Gero | I'm pissed at Fox. They have been trying to destroy Trump all weekend. Megan Kelly needs to be fired for the post debate. That being said,Trump crushed the debate,Trump crushed Hildabeast,Trump crushed Bill the rapist,Trump crushed the moderators.Yea I'm deplorable.
24 | Dwight K. Lent | A navy sailor in a sub takes 6 pictures deemed classified confidential and gets prison time.......what makes Hillary any different for mishandling classified material? She's a Clinton and above the law and you want her running as POTUS?
25 | Peyton Birk | Of the two candidates running for president...Only Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress.Only Hillary Clinton was fired from a job for being unethical.Only Hillary Clinton deleted 33 some thousand emails after she was ordered to hand them over to the Fed.Only Hillary Clinton had that same computer wiped clean by professionals.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about Benghazi.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about her emails.Only Hillary Clinton got the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughed about it.Only Hillary Clinton lied about lying to the American people.Only Hillary Clinton was involved in " Cash Cow "Only Hillary Clinton has a long list of scandals.Only Hillary Clinton lied about being under sniper fire.Only Hillary Clinton nationally belittled her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers.Only Hillary Clinton will not release her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banks.Only Hillary Clinton is tied to Monsanto.Only Hillary Clinton is a career politician.Only Hillary Clinton was labeled " Extremely careless " about national security by the FBI !Only Hillary Clinton benefited from the DNC rigging an election !Only Hillary Clinton had to return stolen items from the White House.Only Hillary Clinton said the Benghazi victims parents were lying.Only Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class.Only Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her based on her gender.Only Hillary Clinton has never created any jobs.Only Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI and found to have put national security at risk.Only Hillary Clinton has no real accomplishments after a lifetime in politics.Only Hillary Clinton has had two or more movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics.Only Hillary Clinton was called "Broomstick one" by the SS.Only Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she had simply told the truth in the first place ! Fact - all facts !Only Hillary Clinton regularly cussed out and belittled her SS detail.Only Hillary Clinton Only Hillary Clinton Only Hillary Clinton over and over again.But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump ? That is insane !I will never understand how any moral person in good conscience could vote for this woman.

She is a basket of Lies.

15 | Danielle Miller | Come on now! LOL CNN says Hilary won the debate!!!I saw a different debate and from the silence on FB Hilary Land so did they.This is why we don't trust media.

18 | Connie DePasquale | Proud of you Mike Pence! Glad you're on our team ! What a fine gentleman. Help your running partner only you can do it! He's got a lot of potential!
19 | Dee Morris | I am proud of you MIKE Pence for standing for what you know is right for this country. Of course none of us liked what was on Trumps tapes, but he has become a better person and apologized for his awful comments. Stay strong.
20 | Becky Dille-Tracy | Yeah, CNN falsely reported today that Pence is pulling out of the race.  Mainstream media are a bunch of lying propaganda pushers.
21 | John Smith | All of those fool hearted senators and congressmen and women who ran away on Friday sure do look pretty stupid right now!!!
22 | Laine Byrum | Trump ended debate with much more class than the ol witch. He gave her a real compliment and left it at that  She could barely spit out something and then turned into talking about herself. Tasteless
23 | Vickie Trudell | YES!  Can't wait till the next one!!  It WILL be the final blow to HilLIARy, before, we the people, finally take her out, once and for all, when we OVERWHELMINGLY elect Donald J. Trump as our next President!!!
24 | Tina Green | I think Pence is a great VP choice, so what if Mr. Trump didn't agree with his views on war, but together I feel they would make a great team. Hillary wants to keep Obama care but people the working people that can't afford healthcare and don't get healthcare free because they make to much are penalized with it being taken out of their federal tax returns every yr. So I hope for better healthcare reform. She never said anything about bringing jobs to America like Trump did, she just don't want foreign countries getting mad at us! I feel Mr Trump is a smart business man and I can only trust that God guides my hand as I vote this November.

1 | Ty Pendleton | Like this if you think Hillary Clinton should be in jail for LIFE cleaning floors and making bologna sandwiches. Trump2016!

3 | Alexander Joseph Cocuzza Coozer VII | How manny signatures on a petition would it take for Fox News to fire Megyn Kelly?
4 | Amir Parvez | I'm a Muslim. We have to choose the 'Lesser Evil'? Well there is absolutely no evidence that Hillary Clinton is the lesser evil! And even if she is, when the lesser evil is SO EVIL, it's not a choice! Hillary Clinton supporters would be responsible for the economic slavery and evil wars Hillary Clinton, her corporate owners and oligarch friends will wage all over the world. The blood and sufferings of millions of people all over the world will be on those Clinton supporters because they didn't fight for Bernie Sanders and let the fear of Donald Trump make them support corrupt, evil, warmonger criminal Hillary Clinton.Hillary has a record of doing many of the things Trump only talks about. Trump won't be able to do most of that stuff, but Clinton will.Oh and I'm a Brown guy with a Muslim name who is supposed to be hated by Trump and his supporters but I still hope Clinton loses to Trump because I understand what America deserves and the world needs.Nothing and no one can make me budge from #NeverHillary #HillaryForPrison2016!

6 | Dale Johnson | I love how they panic because they think Russia is trying to Influence the election but don't have any problem with the fact that 95% of the main stream media including NBC who dug up the bus tape is working diligently to influence the election against Trump. Ha!
7 | Lynda Wilson | Trump said nothing that 99% of men would say if they thought no one was around. It was just talk, we all know this is how it is, so just get over it
8 | Rene DjRene Cantu | In my eyes this election boils down to two things. If you believe in Socialism you vote for Hillary and if you believe in Capitalism you vote for Trump. All this reality TV character assassination drama is to distract Americans from the real issues. And the media is in on it and clearly favors Clinton. The hypocrisy of demonizing one candidate for his "words" and giving the other candidate a pass for all the horrible actions she and her husband have done. It's so obvious and it's laughable that our country has taken the bait...
9 | Amir Parvez | Hillary Clinton is a threat to American Democracy (what's left of it) and world peace. A vote for her is a vote for worldwide economic slavery and evil, endless war! She's a corrupt, evil, lying warmonger who already has blood on her hands of thousands of people and millions of dollars of blood money in the Clinton Foundation. #NeverHillary #HillaryForPrison2016
10 | Mary Lou Melter Collins | Recall that Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Barack Hussein Obama writes about him in his books.How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare ‚Äî Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty ‚Äî Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt ‚Äî Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control ‚Äî Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare ‚Äî Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education ‚Äî Take control of what people read and listen to ‚Äî take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion ‚Äî Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare ‚Äî Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?
11 | Ivy Devine | Fantastic DEBATE ! Trump was attacked with the first question and ended the debate wiping the false grin right off Hillary's face ! He made a great come back and restored his reputation on point and with each subject that was brought up ! Thank you Trump. I sat there on the couch and yelled answers that you seemed to hear and respond to. Hillary having had so many compliments on her smiling demeanor at the last debate...tried to use it to her advantage again...but alas the truth hurts and when your lips are quivering in anger it's necessary to scowl whether you are a good actor or not. Her ACT is about over with this one...TOO many lies, too many ghost, too many skeletons in her closet..."They're  coming to get you...Barbara." In this case they are coming to get Hillary !
12 | Bonnie Neel Kuhlman | They can find a tape of Trump 11 years ago, but they can't find 33,000 deleted emails?!!!!!  No one died because of a little locker room talk.
13 | Sandra Trotter Miedlar | I thought Trump had a great night, but if you watch Megan Kelly you won't think so. She is not good for Fox news!  Go to NBC
14 | Terri Bausch Justick | Copied from another post .....some things forgotten. How quickly we forget!  If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten.  If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
15 | Whitney Potwin | As a woman with two daughters, I teach my girls that actions speak so much louder than words!  I think it's deplorable Hillary thinks I should vote for her based on her gender or the gender of my children!  Does she not think I'm smart enough to make a well informed (not media fed) decision?  I am an educated woman and I will vote based on the facts!  I will teach my daughters to do the same!!!!
16 | Lynette Wright | Hillary Clinton you got knocked the f$$k out tonight lol"It's a good thing Trump isn't in charge of the law in this country." -Hillary Clinton"Yeah, because you'd be in jail." -Donald Trump
17 | Revell Thompson | I would love for someone at FOX to tell me why we get stuck having to listen to that stupid Megyn Kelly every time we have a debate? She can't stand that Trump doesn't think she is as cute as she thinks she is, so all she does is bash him. I for one, am sick and tired of her and her bias. Go away Megyn. We are SO TIRED OF YOU.
18 | Tara Keyes Goodrich | Who are these holier than thou women who are shocked by offensive "locker room" talk? I've heard worse things in rap music, read worse in 50 Shades, and said worse things about certain men.
19 | Shelly Beth | Get rid of Megyn Kelly she is not fair and balanced she is pro-hillary all the way and you can tell by everything she says about Trump. She just wants to keep this trashy talk going she is not worthy of being on Fox News. Saying thecwords over and over.
20 | Angel Crumpton | I wish Fox News would get rid of Megyn Kelly! There are so many of us that are REALLY sick and tired of her left wing fanny and always after Donald Trump! Always digging at him in any way she can! Very left leaning individual! FoxNews needs to make a change. I NEVER watch her ever anymore. #FoxNews!
21 | Scott Bates | Megan Kelly is so left winged. She is not fair and balanced and I'm forced to watch the liberal channels while she is on, at least there I know I'm going to hear the liberals and they don't hide it. FOX NEWS is number 1 because of the conservatives and FOX is becoming just another left winged media outlet!!
22 | Mary F. Bryan | Megyn Kelly just will not give up the women issue. Megan, most women do not care about a private conversation between private citizens that took place years ago! Give it up. I will stop watching Fox because of you. I used to respect you but I do not any longer. You need to go work for CNN or straight to the Clinton Camp.
23 | Barbara Moore | Clintons should be in jail! The moderators were Biased! And I still can't stand Megan Kelly not wan Williams!! I boycotted their show! They are crooked!!
24 | RogerHelen Welborn | Kelly is so biased against Trump she should be ashamed of it. Tried to dismiss women who were raped and sexually assaulted as irrelevant but kept harping on a 11 year old tape he aplogized to his wife, family and America for.
25 | Jessica Pollitt | Trump won the debate hands down! He was calm, poised, and he brought up the right stuff. We need Trump for president so that we can finally send Hillary where she needs to be..JAIL!Hillary basically laughed through the whole debate. I'm glad she sees this as a joke and that's the last type of person I would want as a leader because her emails, this country, all of these issues IS NOT a JOKE.
