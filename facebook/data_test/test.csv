2 | Margie Jones Grundy | 7 | 1562017377151620_1562024860484205 | The great irony (and beautiful karma) of this election will be that a Muslim father, a Latino beauty, a black president, and a whole army of older, educated white women will bring the downfall and complete humiliation of Trump.....(a comment worthy of cut and paste).
3 | Gudrun Krause | 2 | 1562017377151620_1562028183817206 | How wonderful for her to be able to do that. After all she has been through she can freely voice her opinion and vote. Who she votes for is nobody's business. That she is able to do so is amazing. The comments are disrespectful and nasty. Would be interesting to know if any one of you would talk to your grandmother that way or to that lady's face. Probably not.
